A|I have, uh,|%
A|I, well, I used to have the opinion that there that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, uh, before, uh,|sd
A|simply because.|%
A|The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, uh, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.|sv
B|Compile more statistics.|bf
A|That's right,|aa
A|and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.|sv
B|More especially where you are.|aa
B|Are you, in Washington D C or Washington state?|qy
A|Well, yeah.|b
A|No,|nn
A|I am in, I am in Washington D C.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|I was going to say,|%
A|Actually it,|%
A|you know, I do a lot of business here,|sd
A|and I come here quite often|sd
A|and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. Regardless of the racial makeup,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|but it's, it's real, uh,|%
A|there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they, uh,|sd
B|It just really grabs your attention.|ba
A|Yeah.|aa
B|It just makes the whole place seem like that.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess, uh, uh,|sd
A|when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, Bennett, I think his name was, became the drug czar, uh, for, uh, President Bush, he was going to focus on it, on this area and do something about it|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I see that even he was met without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.|sd
B|What do you, what do you think is causing all this,|qo
A|Well,|%
B|because, it seems that there|%
B|even though|%
B|crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Well, I, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.|sd
A|I have one theory,|sd
A|and it's brought to us by two things.|sd
A|One I, I believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,|sd
A|I am not even, I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey and, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled with a fight. You know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument.|sv
A|And, and then I, I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,|sd
A|so I think that particularly|%
A|I, I was reading the other day about, uh, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the the highest,|sd
A|I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America uh, per capita.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I was, I have not seen that,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
A|I mean the Saturday night special stuff|sd
A|so,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|That, that's what I think about it,|sd
A|that's some of the things I think about it,|sd
A|plus like drop I do not know,|sd
A|what are your views?|qo
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|I tend to agree with you with, you know,|aa
B|it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|And, and along with that, you know,|%
B|and then you start making a movie and it has no, there's no call for something violent,|sv
B|but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it|sv
A|well that's, that's, that's the impression I get, you know.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I, and I imagine that it's, you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,|sv
A|people want to,|%
A|it conditions people to it|sv
A|and, uh, you have to|%
A|it has to be even, uh, magnified to to attract people's attention. I guess, to have them spend money on something like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you become callous.|bf
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women|sv
A|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|uh, I mean I, I, read now where we are, you know,|sd
A|women are young women are arrested fighting with knives over, over whatever. whatever reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,|arp_nd
A|but, that's what|%
A|seems that those things happened did not happen in that manner before television.|sv
A|And I, I, I, I have to think that, that it has some influence on it.|sv
A|But,|%
B|I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I do not know if you listen to him or not,|qy^d
A|No.|nn
B|he's on A M,|sd
B|but, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the,|sd
B|there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,|sd
A|Oh, yes.|ny
B|and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.|sd
B|For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids,|sd
B|and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".|sd
B|And people, I, I, I, I guess they confused discipline with punishment.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, just,|%
B|it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.|sv
B|It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.|sv
B|And I disagree,|ar
B|and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
A|Well, I mean, I, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, uh, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, that, uh, there's so there's so much of a return from to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.|sv
A|And, and that is not emphasized.|sv
A|I recognize there's, there's over crowding problems|sd
A|and, and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that that's complicated the entire process.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|What I also think that,|%
A|I guess it's the reflection of the society where, where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, uh,|sv
A|you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you, where you live|sv
A|or. I do not mean attachment and responsibility,|sd
A|I guess I mean any sort of,|%
B|Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.|sv
B|It's like, oh boy, I wish they would stop doing that.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|I, I do not know how that's,|h
A|I do not think it's done by, uh,|h
A|the changes come simply by statutory nature.|sv
A|I do not know what it really will take|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And, I do not know if I have solutions, except, except to,|sd
A|you know, I am sort of a, a, an advocate of, of, uh, of letting people, of having free speech|sd
A|and I guess to curb, uh,|%
A|television, uh, the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|However, there does seem to be a,|%
A|right now in verbalizing,|%
A|it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then how many,|%
A|And the sacrifice is not that great.|sv
B|How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between, you know, what you see and how|qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|I think, I think that's correct.|aa
B|And, yes|%
B|but, you know, as soon as you start, uh,|%
A|Well, Texas has, uh, Texas has, uh, has always struck me,|sd
A|I mean I, I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, uh, uh, short business stints.|sd
A|And it seems to me they are a pretty, pretty tough law and order state,|sv
A|but that's a,|%
A|but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.|sv
A|Just citing that, you know.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, unfortunately you have got a lot of the, uh,|%
B|some, well a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close, to the border with Mexico,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|we have got a lot of that influence.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
