A|the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that,|sd
A|this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less,|sd
A|but it wears off.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh,|sd
A|it starts off with like a tic,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all.|sd
A|And it was just so realistic.|sd
A|The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What does, uh,|qw

B|Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah,|b

B|I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.|sd
A|I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed|sd
B|I don't remember when the horse got killed.|sd
A|Oh,|%
A|when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can tell I'm an animal lover,|sv

A|it really was.|sv
B|It,|%
B|there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|What did you think about the buffalo scenes.|qw^d
A|Oh, I thought it was awful, and so graphic,|sv
B|That was,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know.|sd
A|I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie.|sd
B|Oh, oh.|b
A|Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|it's not,|%
A|But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.|sd
A|No|aa
A|it wasn't|sd
B|Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,|sv
B|like that was great.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|And there were so many of them.|sd
B|I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|really.|b
B|So that was pretty.|sv
A|And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.|sv
B|I wonder how they kept up with them, though,|sd
B|it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|I guess they graze, though,|sd
B|that wouldn't be a problem.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|huh-uh.|nn
A|It was,|%
A|they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes|sd
A|and, uh, they had to teach a wolf how to, to howl.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves|sd
B|I guess they're just not domesticated,|sv
B|or, or,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|what,|%
A|they just don't howl that much anymore.|sv
A|I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off|sd
A|and that's all they'd have to do|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well that's funny.|ba
A|Well, I think we've made it.|sv
B|Oh is that five minutes,|qy^d
