A|Yeah.|b
B|But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.|sd
A|Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.|sv

A|Yeah.|aa
A|I think it's fun,|sv
A|I like just looking at the billboards.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.|sv

B|but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,|sd

B|last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|right.|b
B|And it's going to go to the highest bidder|sd

A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|I would think it,|ba

A|but it's like, they'll try something|sd
A|and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you get tired of that.|sv
B|That's typical bureaucracy though.|sv
B|That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go|sv
