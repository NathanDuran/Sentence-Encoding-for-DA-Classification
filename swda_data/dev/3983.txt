A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,|sd
A|but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,|sd
A|and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,|sd
A|and so, it's really a fun one.|sd
A|I like that.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
B|It's good to get use out of one.|sv
A|Uh-huh|aa
B|I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|%
B|I mean, I read it,|sd
B|but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes.|aa

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.|sd

A|Oh, that.|b

B|he likes to try that,|sd
B|so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though,|sd
B|after a while if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
A|They do, they can do that.|aa
A|I found that they've been fun for my little girls,|sd
A|they're five and four years old,|sd
A|and  they like to go through|sd
A|and,|%
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|they're just kind of  getting started now.|qy^d

A|and so we've found good use for those.|sd
B|Mine is a senior in high school,|sd
B|so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade.|qy^d
