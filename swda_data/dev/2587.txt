A|Go ahead.|ad
B|Oh, um, uh, I usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, you know, being, uh,|%
B|I mean, by the time you get off work, go by and pick up the, uh, baby from the baby sitter, it's, you know, after six|sd

B|it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything.|sd

B|Uh-huh,|b
B|oh yeah.|b
A|I only get the newspaper on the weekends|sd
A|so|%
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I don't even have, time to read the newspaper except in passing,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|I,  I guess  occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though.|sd
B|But, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|We have, uh, a news thing on the computer that, uh, that I'll, I'll try to look at every day.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it, it's pretty much headline news.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we look for anyway.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh. I, do you think that the quality of the, uh, the, you know, the news events that you get are,|sv
B|what do you think about it?|qo
A|Well I, I guess it's pretty good.|sv
A|And, and like the Dallas area,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  I, I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this,|sv
A|there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,  borderline  at that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, you know, there's a lot of competition in the media.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh. You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|true.|aa
A|I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle East.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|That,|%

B|so, it will be interesting to see what happens.|sv

A|true.|aa
A|Trying to think what else is,  is  current.|^h
B|Right.|b
B|Uh, uh,|b
A|Well, um, I don't know what to say|sd

A|they, uh,|%
A|looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I hate to see that,|sd
B|but it's, uh, that, you know, if what it's going to take,|%
B|well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our federal income tax.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, you know, but we need good schools.|sv
B|Uh, we're more involved in that now.|sv
B|And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|So,|%
A|I would think they could find a better way to fund it though,|sv
A|but they haven't for,|%
B|No.|aa
B|You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery.|sd
A|Well, they're struggling with it.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.|sv
B|I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax.|sv
B|I mean, probably would have paid the same amount|sv
B|but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|True.|ba
B|So,|%
A|I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that.|sv
B|No.|aa
B|It'll be interesting to see what happens.|sv
A|Trying to think what else is current.|^h
B|I, you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days.|sd
B|So it, uh,|%
B|I'm a little behind on things.|sd

B|that's, that's sad.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations,|sd
B|and,  uh,  I don't know what I've would have done in the situation.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,  finish  the job while we were in there.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides.|sd
B|I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.|sv
B|I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away.|sv
A|Seems to have helped him though,  popularity wise.|sv
B|Yeah, it, it,  it did a lot.|aa
