B|I really didn't like it at all.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|It was, it was written back in the early eighties.|sd

A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing.|sd
A|Interesting.|ba
B|It was really an interesting,|aa

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
A|That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.|sd

A|yeah.|b
B|You know how that is,|qh

B|Yeah,|ny
B|she has,|sd
B|because I, I remember seeing a new book by her that was out,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|and she really was good.|sv
A|I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,  intricately|sd
B|Uh-huh.|%
A|and, um, and, you know, I just,|%
A|but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,  or  had to write it, read it in high school or college,|sd
B|but I don't remember it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and I got her the, I got her someone,|sd

B|I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.|sd
A|Oh, how interesting.|ba
B|You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so I got that for her,|sd
B|and she loved doing that.|sd
A|Oh, I'll bet,|ba
A|yeah.|b

A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|But, um,|%
A|Well, I read that,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|when|%
A|if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,|sd
B|Yeah.|aa

A|Actually, it's for school,|sd
A|but it's for, um,|%
A|there's a, a literary|%

A|it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.|sd
A|The first issue doesn't come out until next year,|sd
A|but, um,|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I'm doing  some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,|sd
B|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|and I've,|%
A|yeah,|aa
A|it's really neat because these are brand new books|sd
A|and I,  just got  a, I got a, this one,|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,  and  religion and all that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach,|sd
A|and it's a, a, a biography,  that is  really interesting,|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
B|Oh, that's fascinating.|ba
A|I mean, it, it's fascinating,|aa
A|it really is.|aa
B|Oh.|b
A|Um, but it's so long,|sd
A|I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing,|sd
A|but I think,  eventually  I'll go back to it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's,  it  was written,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,|sd
A|so it's a brand new book.|sd
B|Oh, it's a brand new book.|bf
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that, that would be wonderful  to read something like that.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|and he really, this man really  shed some light on, um, some,  aspects  of of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians|sv
B|Yes.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and they just went from generation,  probably  to generation,  just with  these, with these all passing it from one to the other.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|that's right.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|uh-huh,|b
A|and, um,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|it was just really  interesting,|aa
A|if that's, you know, that's kind of what,|%
A|but I have to|%
A|not only am, am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board|sd
A|so,|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I don't  know if I want to take that responsibility or not,|sd
A|but But at least I,  can tell them  what I think,|sd
B|Wow, that's rough.|ba
B|That's real rough.|ba
A|so, um,  it's  real interesting.|sv
B|Yeah.  Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine *sd that was similar to that.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do in small colleges,|sv
A|Yes|b
A|Yeah,|b
B|but,  um,|%
A|that it,|%
A|you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,  like  that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|right,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|because  it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.|sv
A|That's one way,|%
A|it's really good public relations for small schools,|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I think  so|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing,|sd
A|and so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,|qw
A|Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,  in  the French and then has been translated into English by,  various  people.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And the translations are all so different from one another.|sd
B|All different.|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|So it's multiple translations of single works|sd
A|and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um,|sd
A|my work, is just kind of compiling,  all  that for him.|sd
B|Gosh.|ba
A|So,|%
B|That's great.|ba
A|It's real interesting.  There are days when  I would be prefer ,  really doing that|aa
B|Boy, you really lift me up to a different,|ba
B|I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,  cleaning  the stove|sd
B|and,|%
B|You know, I'm   I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.|sd
B|That would be nice.|ba
A|I don't know if I've told you,|h
A|but, um, this is not on the subject,|sd
