A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|wow, I don't know what that was.|sd
B|What was that?|qw
A|I don't know|sd
B|And, uh, to, uh, the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, yes.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh, we have not camped in any of those places,|sd
A|in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,|sd
A|but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, uh, Daingerfield|sd
A|and in Texas that is where we camp basically. Uh,|sd
B|What are they like?|qo
A|They are very nice.|sd
A|Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.|sd
A|It has a nice little lake|sd
A|and it has some really wonderful, uh, sights that are in the wooded areas.|sd
A|Uh, the facilities are quite nice|sd
A|and our children liked, liked it quite well.|sd
A|and you know they,|%
A|we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.|sd
A|And, uh, it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, now Daingerfield is,|%
A|let's see,|^h
A|I think that's a little bit more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.|sv
A|At any rate it was, it was very nice as well.|sd
A|But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, uh, had done a lot of camping in Michigan,|sd
A|I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially,|sd
A|and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,|sd
A|so, uh, my parents were real avid campers|sd
A|and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.|sd
A|So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Do you have a large tent|qy
A|or,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it was a nine by twelve.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And how many does it sleep, uh, comfortably?|qw
B|Well, there, well supposedly,|sv
B|they always say it sleeps more than it does.|sv
A|Right|b
B|But they,|%
B|it would have slept three adults anyway.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, uh, we invested in some stacking, uh, cots, you know, that were like bunk, bunk beds,|sd
A|but they were cots, fold up cots.|sd
A|That really gave us a lot more space, um, floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around|sd
A|and,|%
B|Right.|b
A|uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day|sd
A|so that was real nice.|sd
A|But, uh, we, uh,|%
A|like, my in-laws also had a camper, or, uh, a pop up tent, you know, one of those trailer tops|sd
A|and those are really nice too.|sd
A|A little more, uh, luxurious, so to speak, but not much|sd
B|do they have a kitchen in them?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|It's really nice,|sd
A|in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, uh, and the whole business.|sd
A|It was quite nice in that respect.|sd
A|Uh, and everything was very convenient|sd
A|and you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,|sd
B|Trunk  of your car all time, right.|^2
A|and that was nice.|sd
A|So, uh, do you have plans for, for any other camping trips in the near future?|qy
B|Uh, maybe, uh, maybe back to Caddo, or, Uh, Purdis Creek.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,|sd
B|it's a new park.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And there is, uh, not really camping,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
B|what is it called, Cedar Hill.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Lake Joe Pool.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|b
B|And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|I have been in that area.|sd
A|That is a really pretty state park.|sv
A|Uh, just,|%
A|we did not camp there,|sd
A|but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area|sd
A|and it's real lovely.|sv
A|It's close to the lake and close to,|sd
A|I think it's close to the dam up there|sd
A|so it's, it's really quite pretty.|sv
A|Uh, are you, um,|qy
A|let's see what was,|^h
A|I was going to ask you something else.|^h
A|Oh, do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?|qy
B|Oh, from those three,|^h
B|just, just, uh, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best.|na
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that's right.|sd
A|I, I would,|%
A|I have never been there|sd
A|and I would love to see what it looks like|sd
B|It's not, it's not very deep.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they did build a dam on it,|sd
B|but it was there before they built the dam.|sd
B|It has been there for a hundred years.|sd
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|Apparently, an earth quake caused it.|sv
A|How interesting.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|I guess I never heard the history of that.|sd
A|Huh, well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go.|sd
A|We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.|sd
A|Um, our children are both grown|sd
A|and, and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.|sd
A|And so, uh, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see what it looks like.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's really nice.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And I, I don't know,|h
B|probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere  in Texas.|sv
A|Is it?|bh
A|Uh, yeah,|aa
A|I think so.|sv
A|Especially with, uh, uh,|%
A|when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|especially in East Texas, it's really nice.|sv
A|So, uh, well, I, um, I have enjoyed talking with you.|fc
B|It was nice talking to you.|fc
A|And, um, have, uh, some happy camping trips|fc
A|Hope you get to those places you have talked about.|fc
