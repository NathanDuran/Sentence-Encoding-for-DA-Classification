A|so,|%
B|First how much television watching do you do?|qw
A|I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I like it just for the noise|sd
B|That's right,|b
B|but do you actually watch it, pay attention to it|qy

B|if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.|sd
B|I would rather listen to music.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis|sv
B|and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us|sv
B|and we do not know where that influence came from.|sv
A|Well, I think that, well, part, I think that's partially true, too.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think you have to have the will and the,|sv
A|and, uh, anyway, I think it,|%
B|Uh, right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|you are, you would be susceptible to stuff.|sv
B|Of course, I, uh,|%
A|And it has to be reinforced at another level too.|sv
B|That's|%
A|Do you like specials?|qy
B|Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.|na

A|Oh, right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|In our comedy programs, although,|sd
B|nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can,|sv

B|Oh, I think that's, marvelous.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|I took  a lot of my,  college courses,|sd
B|I took some of my, college courses on television,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so that,|%
B|it's very successful for some of, those things,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but I think I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life,|sv
B|or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life, uh,|sd
B|my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.|sd
A|She got you a|bf
B|Absolutely,|aa
B|I do not know who she thought she was,|sd
B|but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice, and that attitude being demonstrated.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.|sd
A|Oh, well, see that's,|%
B|And,|%
A|But she was probably depressed to begin with.|sv
B|Well, I do not know.|h
A|You know what I mean?|qy
B|Well, she was grumpy to begin with.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|grumpy to begin with.|b^m
A|Yeah.|%
B|There's no doubt about that,|sv
B|but, uh, but you could clearly see those influences, and in my youngsters,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES,|sd
B|and I always thought that was just casual slap stick, comedy,|sd
A|I hate that show|sd
B|but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I decided that was not funny, any more.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I,|%
B|And, I really, I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW.|sv
A|Good.|ba
B|I think that is,|sv
B|the kids watch that|sd
B|and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.|sd
B|And I just, I do not like it.|sd
A|Is not that amazing.|qh
A|How old are your kids?|qw
B|like ice against a glass, then drinking Mine are grown,|sd
B|but I have grandchildren. And, young children around,|sd
A|Oh, okay,|bk
A|so that's,|%
A|Yeah.|b

A|see, it's just my husband and I of the kids shows and all that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|And when they were young I was, really did, uh, watch what they watched.|sd
B|I was|sd
B|I sat down with them|sd

B|Uh-huh|b
A|and did you see,|^q
A|and I could never participate.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it always made me feel a little bit, you know, a loner|sd

A|Really.|b
B|maybe we need to go outside,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company.|sd
B|So I would go out with them,|sd
B|now see there's the problem, parents do not do that.|sv
B|They, say, you go outside and play,|sv
A|That's true.|aa
A|Or, you go rent a video up at, the store and come home and sit down and watch it.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
B|I said,|%

B|And I think that was,|sv
A|Well that's, you know, that's something people do not do,|sv
