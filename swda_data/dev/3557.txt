B|You think about AIDS research?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,|sv
A|and you die from it.|sd
A|So I think that, uh, they need to look into it|sv
A|and it's kind of like cancer.|sv
A|I don't, you know,|h
A|how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.|qh
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think it'll probably be as difficult.|sv
A|Uh, how about yourself.|qo
B|Um, well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,|sd
B|and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.|sv
B|I think that|sv
B|because, besides the fact that it's a deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's, um,|sd
B|although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|they say a million people are infected with the H I V virus,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh,  yeah,|%
A|I think,|sv
B|That's in the world,  or  in America?|qy
B|You,|%
A|Uh, in the country, America.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah|ny
B|Um, that's,|%
A|and they have millions.|sd
B|Whose figure is that?|qw
A|I don't know.|sd
A|I've just heard it on the radio.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|Sometimes you hear things that, on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, do you feel like this is,|qy
A|I, I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you think they should spend more?|qy
B|Uh, I, I think they should, actually, although perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing,|ng
B|and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.|sv
B|I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.|sv
A|What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?|qw
B|Um well, I, well, I am sorry that he has the virus.|sd
A|Magic?|qy^d
B|I, um, I don't know,|h
B|I don't, I think it's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people.|sv
A|Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?|qy
B|Um, well, not, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,|ng
B|but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.|sv
B|It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous.|sv
A|You know, I took advantage of the opportunity when, you know, he came out.|sd
A|I talked to my kids about it, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's something that I hadn't, hadn't done before.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on, uh, safe sex to abstinence,|sd
A|or I was glad he did that, for young kids, because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, let's see.|^h
A|What are some of the other questions.|qw
A|Uh, you don't, uh,|%
A|let's see.|^h
A|I don't have any friends that have the disease.|sd
A|I guess you might, might not.|qy^d
B|Um, yeah,|ny
B|I do.|sd
B|My cousin, does, for instance.|sd
A|Is it pretty nasty?|qy
B|And, um,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah|ny
B|it is.|sd
B|He's actually, um,|sd
B|he had AIDS related complex for a while,|sd
B|and he is now in full-blown AIDS, really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it sounds awful.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's a very nasty thing.|sd
A|Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly|qy
A|and,|%
B|Um, yeah,|ny
B|that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,|sd
B|and the white blood cell count goes down,|sd
B|which is, that's AIDS Related Complex,|sd
B|but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS|sd
A|And,|%
B|and in that case, you know, people are prone to getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got before|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|and,|%
B|yeah,|b
B|that sort of thing,|sd
