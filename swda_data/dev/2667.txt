A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay, uh,|b^m
B|the question was about, uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should.|sd
B|I try to walk.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, last year I would, I did it every day,|sd
B|but I've kind of, in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,|sd
B|but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier.|sd
A|I agree|aa
B|But it's just to get motivated to do it,|sd
B|and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I I do it every night.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's just to get, uh, motivated again,|sd
B|and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.|sd
B|And I was walking,|sd
B|and it got kind of dark.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I was by myself,|sd
B|and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.|sd
A|Ooh.|b
B|And, so I, I kind of got frightened,|sd
B|and I kind of use that as an excuse.|sd
B|All I have to do, is start earlier,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Right.|b
B|I haven't walked since,|sd
B|so.|%
A|It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.|sv
A|I know what you mean.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it sure is.|aa
B|It sure is.|aa
B|How about you?|qo
B|Do you exercise on a regular basis?|qy
A|Um, well, I try to.|na
A|Um, I started at the beginning of this year,|sd
A|I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again,|sd
A|I'm going to be real good,|^q
A|and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, uh, aerobics classes there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they run for two months at a time.|sd
A|And you have to, you do have to pay to take them.|sd
A|And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half,|sd
A|so that was four and a half hours a week.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|And it cost sixty dollars,|sd
A|and I thought, okay, that's not cheap,|sd
A|that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|And I had a friend of mine going,|sd
A|so I was real good,|sd
A|I only missed it about three times.|sd
A|And then, oh, March came around,|sd
A|and I signed up again,|sd
A|and I got, uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I,|sd
A|and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there.|sd
A|And so that was two weeks I had missed,|sd
A|and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's once you get out of that habit you just don't, you don't get back into it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because I teach school,|sd
B|and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.|sd
B|We went in together and hired a private instructor,|sd
B|and she came to our school twice a week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I, I was,|%
B|I would go faithfully,|sd
B|and then I missed once.|sd
B|Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think, if you,|%
B|you just have to stick with it.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April,|sd
A|and this session is about to run out.|sd
A|Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes|sd
A|and some of them require me to go out of town,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone|sd
A|and I've found excuses, uh things like I had the flu last week,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I'm fine this week.|sd
A|I could have gone Monday.|sd
A|I could have gone tonight,|sd
A|and I didn't.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I'm kind of finding excuses,|sd
A|and now it's kind of like, well,|sd
A|this is the last week.|sd
A|I'll just start fresh next week.|sd
A|But, I better better do it.|sd
A|And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.|sd
A|She started taking tennis lessons,|sd
A|and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So.|%
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah|b
B|that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like it's misery loves company.|sv
B|I don't really love exercise.|sd
B|I mean, some I,|%
B|the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,|sd
B|and, uh, it's not President's any more.|sd
B|I don't know what the name of it is anymore.|sd
B|But she loves it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She just enjoys it so much.|sd
B|And I don't.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I'm the same way.|sd
B|I feel good after I do it,|sd
B|but I hate it when I'm doing it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I just,|sd
B|I don't enjoy it at all,|sd
B|and she just loves it.|sd
B|So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, it's a daily thing for her.|sd
B|So, it, you know,|%
B|and it's so hard for me.|sd
B|I envy her,|sd
B|I wish I could be that way,|sd
B|but I don't. I don't,|sd
A|I do too.|sd
B|and I have an older sister that loves running, too,|sd
B|and she runs all the time,|sd
B|but at, to me, it's every minute's agony,|sd
B|and I,|%
B|in fact, I don't run.|sd
B|I hate to run.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something|sd
B|and that helps, you know, pass the time.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|walking is kind of boring.|sv
A|I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,|sd
A|and we try to, we used to try to get together,|sd
A|and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.|sd
A|There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And it's not as boring if you get several people|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|and you can kind of talk,|sv
A|and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,|sv
A|and the aerobics isn't too boring.|sv
A|I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. Um,|sd
A|it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I do, I do have to make myself go,|sd
A|and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,|sd
A|and after I get finished I feel great.|sd
B|Oh, it's great afterwards,|sv
B|yeah.|%
A|I mean, I can go in there,|sd
A|I can be,|%
A|like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,|sd
A|and I'll have headache and everything,|sd
A|and I get out,|sd
A|I don't have a headache any more.|sd
A|I feel great,|sd
A|and I'm just,|%
A|it's amazing how much better I feel.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then just in general, I sleep a lot better|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's right.|aa
A|and I just feel much better.|sd
A|I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,|sd
A|and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better.|sd
B|Exactly|aa
B|it does,|sv
B|it gives you energy.|sv
A|But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I'm too tired,|sd
A|or I have a headache|sd
A|or,|%
A|well, I just got over the flu,|^q
A|and I'm still kind of draggy|^q
A|so I better not go|^q
B|It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it really is.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,|sd
B|and, you know, it's silly not to,|sv
B|but, I don't know,|h
B|it's just a put off.|sv
B|I don't know why I don't do more,|sd
B|and I, and I know that it's good for my health.|sd
B|I know, you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.|sv
B|So.|%
A|Right.|b
B|There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,|sv
B|but I don't know.|h
A|It's just hard to make yourself go.|sv
A|And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,|sd
A|and I've been sweaty,|sd
A|and, and it, you know,|%
A|I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.|sd
A|So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, um, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Does it cost the same for just two nights or,|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it's less expensive.|sd
B|Well, that's good, too.|ba
A|This one was only forty-five dollars.|sd
A|But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go|sd
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|So hopefully.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|it's right there,|sd
A|and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.|sd
A|They've got two different aerobics rooms,|sd
A|they have the mirrors.|sd
A|Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall|sv
A|you don't like to see how you work.|sv
A|But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.|sv
A|But,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then they hire private instructors?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And they have ceiling fans in the rooms,|sd
A|and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. Um,|sd
A|and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.|sd
A|I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I can see that would be, uh, easy.|ba
B|They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.|sv
A|Oh, yeah|b
B|Well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?|qy
A|Quite a few do.|na
A|They have probably, ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,|sd
A|and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. Uh,|sd
A|they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter,|sd
A|and I guess guys can take advantage of that.|sd
A|For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But there's a lot more guys that do that one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,|sd
A|they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that.|sd
A|So they have big variety.|sd
A|They even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.|sd
A|I've never done that one before.|sd
A|But.|%
B|Oh, you have a pool there, too?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Oh, how nice.|ba
A|They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.|sd
A|They've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need just about.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|It's a real, it is a real nice facility.|sd
A|It's also got a full inside basketball court,|sd
A|and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things.|sd
A|But it's, it is very nice.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should.|sd
B|Now to use,|%
A|I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.|sd
A|But.|%
B|Well, does it cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to to go swimming.|qy
B|Do you have to pay for that, too.|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,|sd
A|and it's about eight dollars a month.|sd
B|Oh, that's not bad.|ba
A|No,|aa
A|not at all|aa
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|Pretty cheap.|sv
B|Um.|b
A|And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,|sd
A|but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.|sd
B|I think so too,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Well, and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
A|Hm?|br
B|People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|in fact, uh, the T I-er's families can come in on these things,|sd
