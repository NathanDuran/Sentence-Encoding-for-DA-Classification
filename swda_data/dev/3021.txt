A|Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place|sd
A|and, uh, I'm, uh, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, uh, word.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I have quite a collection myself|sd
B|and, you know, I'm a good hunter|sd
B|and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.|sd
B|Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes|sd
B|and, you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either|sd
B|so,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I, I feel that its, uh,|sv
A|I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns,|sd
A|only outlaws will have guns then.|sd
B|I believe that.|ba
A|And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a a gun, a knife, a, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh,|sv
A|we can handle it|sv
A|but there's an element that can't.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons|sv
B|because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them.|sv
A|They have got them outgunned.|sv
B|You know. Yeah.|aa
B|So.|%
A|There was a  an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|It had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, uh, would be able, they would be able to put down anything that came at them,|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that would be,|%
A|but you  figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh, a thirty-eight, uh,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's,|%
A|Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.|sv
B|No|aa
B|it's sure not.|aa
B|Huh-uh.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time|sd
A|and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control|sd
A|but it was, you had to register as a gun owner,|sd
A|you didn't have to list your guns,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but you had to have this card,|sd
A|it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and that was the first, uh,|sd
A|this was twenty years ago.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit  in that respect.|sd
B|See in California they,  In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.|sd
A|Pardon?|br
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You have to sign a, you know,|sd
B|they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff, before you can buy any big ammunition. Especially for handguns,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|now rifles aren't too bad,|sv
B|but, you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it, or sign up for it,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so.|%
A|We lived in Tennessee for awhile|sd
A|and I bought a pistol there|sd
A|and there was a fifteen day waiting period.|sd
A|You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.|sd
B|Gee.|ba
B|Gee, that's not a bad idea.|ba
A|No,|aa
A|I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh, can make a difference|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|it is.|aa
A|So there's,  I don't,  think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because,|sv
B|No.|b
B|the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course,|sv
B|I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway,|sd
B|I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I'm,|%
B|So.|%
A|We, we're getting into capital punishment now|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, you know.|%
A|But I, I agree with you there that, uh,|aa
B|It would definitely be gun control|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands|sd
A|but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element.|sv
B|Myself.|%
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Well and they're actually a necessity in life,  you know.|sv
A|Oh yes.|aa
B|They're not, you know,|ar
B|not everybody needs a gun|ar
B|but sooner or later I need one.|sd
B|You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know,|sd
B|I'm never had to protect my life or,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street|sd
B|so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects ,|sd
A|You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh, or your pocket all the time.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|aa
A|Yeah.|%
B|No.|aa
B|So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't,|sd
B|and I enjoyed my guns.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I have a good time with them|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well I know what, uh,|%
A|I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun.|sd
A|My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but we have several guns around the house|sd
A|one of these days my grandkids probably.|sv
B|Probably.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
A|But I think it's, uh,|%
A|you got to have, have the|sv
A|living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot|sv
A|but, uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh, they get back up.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|aa
A|If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I had to explain that to my,|sd
B|I've got a six year old now|sd
B|and he, you know,|%
B|I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well|sd
B|they understand now.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know I've taken time to teach them|sd
B|and now the young boy wants to know|sd
B|and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows|sd
B|and I took it away from him,|sd
B|I said now, you know, so he's learning the hard way|sd
B|but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something|sd
B|so,|%
A|I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me.|sd
A|This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,|sd
A|this was a gentleman in his sixties,|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two, and taught me how to shoot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We went squirrel hunting|sd
A|and, and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two|sd
B|All right.|b
A|and, I was probably about twelve at the time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I thought that was the neatest thing|sd
A|and, of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and he let me shoot and showed me how.|sd
B|All right.|b
B|I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Well that's about all I,|sd
A|we agreed pretty well on this I think.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think so.|aa
A|Okay.|fc
A|Well it's been real nice talking with you.|fc
B|All right,|fc
B|have a good one.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye|fc
