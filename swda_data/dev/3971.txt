A|Yeah.|b

B|They, they got all, you know,|sd
B|they're, they're, they're real balanced out.|sd
B|They got real good pitching,|sd
B|and they got the hitting to go along with it.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, you know.|sd
B|I don't really know what it is,|sd
B|but, but every team that's, that's really good seems,|sd
B|you know, like the A had, they had, they just had it all that one year.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|um I was mostly an A fan, you know.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know|sd

A|I know.|ba
B|but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.|sv

B|they're pretty balanced out all the way through.|sd
B|It just might be the drive, you know more than anything else,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they just, they probably just need something to push them because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Or somebody basically,|sd
B|maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.|sd
B|Maybe that's what, you know, that's what some teams need.|sd

B|I can't figure out why.|sd
B|You have to figure out why they're all doing that, I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, you know the Braves, Braves didn't win,|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, you're right|aa
