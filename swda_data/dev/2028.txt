B|Um|%
A|and that's cool for|sd
A|or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,|sd
A|no rain in the last month, I don't think.|sd
A|The ground's very dry|sd
A|and our yard work, everything is in bloom,|sd
A|so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,|sd
A|but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,|sd
A|we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Everything blooming,|sd
A|and, and the weather.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,|sd
A|so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that.|sd
B|The blue flu,|bf
A|Yeah.|b

A|Um.|%
B|It has been untypically wet for this time of year,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,|sd

A|Uh.|%
B|but fortunately it rains|sd
B|and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,|sd
B|and, well I guess we're still in winter,|sd
B|and, uh, we have had no snow.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No snow?|bh
B|To speak of, to speak of.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter|sd
B|and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,|sd
B|but, uh, I envy you your ninety-four degrees.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes|aa
A|it is.|sd
A|Down in the more southern and western areas.|sd
A|And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and, uh, very windy.|sd
A|It's amazing to me|sd
A|because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,|sd
A|and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.|sd
A|It does,|sd
A|I, I|%
A|very seldom, if any,|sd
A|I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands,|sd
B|and it was that way every day.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|so, that, uh,|%
B|you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, otherwise as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh, series.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|I, I received a call last night because of the, uh,|sd
B|I had not received my, uh, personal identification number.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|So, uh, is there any,|qy
B|I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.|sd
A|It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.|sd

B|No,|nn
B|I do not.|sd
B|I work for G T E.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from Jack.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've known Jack for some time.|sd
B|I'm in the speech processing business, and have been for a number of years,|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|so I was very much interested, in, in being a speaker for this|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments,|sd
A|and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer,|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|and, uh, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, that, that's really strange.|sv
A|I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though.|sd
A|I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland|sd
A|or,|%
B|I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in other, uh, similar type of activities.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,|sd
B|so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We haven't talked much about the weather|sd

A|let's see, I can't,|^h
A|I was looking at it,|sd
A|I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,|sd
A|and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|In environmental engineering, uh,|bf
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, the work place environment|qy
B|or,|%
A|Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.|arp_nd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|Taking, taking care of uh,|sd
A|I'm actually in the air division,|sd
A|and we monitor, um, anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building,|sd
A|or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the work place|sd
A|and we take care of that,|sd
A|but , within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, uh, solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I had|%
B|my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, uh, concerning recycling in the community.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course we have several plants here,|sd
A|but, um, we do air modeling also.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.|sd
A|What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,|sd
A|and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.|sd
B|Well, that's interesting.|ba
A|And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site|sd
A|and, and, um, its concentration,|sd
A|and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.|sd
