A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States.|sv
B|Okay.|b
A|How do you feel about that.|qo
B|I don't really,|%
B|I more,|%
B|I don't know about the government as much as, uh,|sd
B|the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all|sd
B|and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.|sv
B|I'm, I'm worried about them.|sd
B|They're in a very, uh, tumultuous state right now with the kinds of, uh, adaptations that they're attempting to go through, uh.|sv
A|I'm concerned about them not as a military threat, but as a burden.|sd
A|They're very large|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they can become very quickly a large financial burden, as, as one more stepchild we have to carry around.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think that's, that's a real important aspect|sv
B|and that, uh, as the, the the most, the|%
B|let's see, the more that we do, that we do or that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming, uh, you know, a reality.|sv
B|I know that, uh, this last winter was very hard on, uh, several areas in the, in the, the Ukraine, particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia, uh,|sv
B|the people there have money,|sv
B|that's not their problem,|sv
B|but there's no food for them to buy,|sd
B|and its,|%
B|you can't eat money.|sd
A|And they have, a, a problem, their, their whole attitude, uh,|sv
A|I, I'm not sure which crop it was,|sd
A|but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that. Make the government do that, that's not my job.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now,|sv
B|and, uh, they've been, they've been under, under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms|sv
B|but they don't know how to act yet.|sv
B|They don't understand that to make that work,|sv
B|they've got to take some responsibility for themselves.|sv
B|It's not just the government's responsibility anymore.|sv
B|You can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well.|sv
A|Absolutely,|aa
A|and, and I think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back.|sv
A|People only go forward|sv
A|and I think that that is giving them,|sv
A|I'm expecting a call|sd
A|and unfortunately, I think it's come through.|sv
A|I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
B|Okay.|b
A|Thank you,|ft
A|bye,|fc
B|All right,|fc
B|bye-bye.|fc
