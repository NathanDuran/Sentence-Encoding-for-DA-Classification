B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay,|b^m
A|where have you all been on vacation recently?|qw
B|Recently,|sd
B|my most recent trip was last year,|sd
B|and that was Detroit.|sd
A|Detroit?|br
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?|qy
B|Well, it wasn't really.|ng
B|It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.|sd
A|Right,|bk
A|okay.|bk
B|And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?|qy^d
B|No.|nn
B|The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.|sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|And that was real nice. Uh,|sv
A|Did you scuba dive there?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.|sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.|sd
A|Oh, that would be enjoyable.|ba
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|that's, a nice break.|ba
B|Huh.|b
A|I haven't been on vacation in a while either.|sd
A|Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
B|Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.|ba
A|So it's a lot of fun.|sd
A|I worked up there last summer,|sd
A|so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long|sd
B|Oh, well, that's nice.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Worked at a camp there,|sd
A|and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.|sd
A|So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.|sd
B|Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,|sd
B|and that's canoeing.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,|sd
B|and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,|sd
B|and they've really enjoyed it.|sd
A|That's nice.|ba
A|We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.|sd
B|It's a whole new,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|It's really, really pretty.|sv
A|I was a little kid then,|sd
A|and we to have, uh,|%
A|we stayed at some park|sd
A|and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,|sd
A|and he would give a little talk about mountain things.|sd
A|You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,|sd
A|but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,|sd
B|Sure.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we would have to, we'd|sd
A|and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found|sd
A|and, That's a good family place to go,|sv
B|Oh, that's neat.|ba
B|Sure.|b
A|and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,|sv
A|but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was like,|sv
B|Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,|sv
B|and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And you're more receptive.|sv
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Well, we, um, let's see,|^h
A|the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to England a few years ago.|sd
B|Oh, that's exciting.|ba
A|I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place|sd
A|and it's, there's not a language barrier|sd
A|so you don't,|%
A|I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,|sd
A|and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,|sv
A|but it's, it was really fun.|sv
A|I, I, I really enjoyed that.|sd
A|I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,|sd
B|but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,|sd
B|because she really has a great desire to do that,|sd
B|because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.|sd
A|It, it's really nice.|sv
A|I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city,|sd
A|because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are|sd
A|and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,|sd
A|but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,|sd
B|Do your own thing.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I had a great time doing that.|sd
A|It was really interesting.|sv
B|That's wonderful.|ba
B|There's a lot out there to see,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know,|ba
B|I'll say .|ba
A|I keep wanting to get up to,|sd
A|I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States.|sd
A|I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,|sd
B|Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So that was, that, that's a nice place.|sv
B|Canada is very nice.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|that would be nice.|sv
A|I had a friend from there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,|sd
A|but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.|sd
B|Oh, yes,|aa
B|absolutely.|aa
B|Sure,|b
B|somebody that knows their way around.|bf
A|So, yeah,|aa
A|that's why, that's why England was nice.|sd
A|Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,|sd
A|and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the,|sd
A|most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,|sd
B|Well, you've been quite a few places there|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we have.|sd
A|We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.|sd
B|Once you think about it, huh.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,|sd
A|and you slept on the train at night.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|But there wasn't a,|%
A|it was strange,|sv
A|it was kind of sad,|sv
A|there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English|sd
A|and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's great.|ba
A|So we were kind of pitiful.|sd
A|We found one restaurant we were in and got seated,|sd
A|and then no one knew English in there,|sd
A|and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But it was,|%
B|What did you wind up with?|qw
A|Oh, I had fondue.|sd
A|That was easy to say|sd
B|Oh, okay|bk
A|Tried to get fondue and white wine,|sd
A|and that was,|%
B|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.|sd
A|There were some people at the next table who spoke English,|sd
A|so we elicited their aid for a while|sd
B|They kind of guided you.|bf
A|and, they were very helpful|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, It was, it was a pleasant time.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
A|I'd, I'd love to go back there.|sd
A|There's just not time|sd
A|There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.|sv
B|I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|That's|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I guess that's what retirement is all about.|sv
A|That and sleeping late|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|I keep hoping for.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well it was nice talking with you.|fc
B|I understand that.|sd
B|Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.|fc
A|And have a good afternoon.|fc
B|You do the same.|fc
A|Okay.|fc
B|Thank you.|ft
A|Good-bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
