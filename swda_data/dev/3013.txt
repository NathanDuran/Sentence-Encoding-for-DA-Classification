A|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?|qw
B|Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool|sd
B|and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy.|sd
B|It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I like that.|sd
B|Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it|sd
B|and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,|sd
B|but I just use those little cans of chicken.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it makes it so much easier,|sd
B|and so you dump the rice,|sd
B|you dump the chicken|sd
B|and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,|sd
B|now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,|sd
B|but I get my kids to do that,|sd
B|so,|%
A|Oh|sd
B|I, I don't have to do that.|sd
B|And, um, and it really,|%
B|and you mix it all up with|sd
B|there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,|sd
B|but it's so simple|sd
B|and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|You serve it cold?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Oh, yeah,|bk
A|that sounds good.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it has to sit in the fridge over night,|sd
B|but, but it's really good.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|And I like that one.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue|sd
B|Exactly.|b
A|like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over|sd
A|and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba
A|And it was real good.|sd
A|You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way|sd
A|and then people think they're eating steak or something|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|And these days that helps, doesn't it?|qy
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|It really does.|sd
B|I know what you mean.|sd
A|I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.|sd
B|Now spaghetti's such an easy one.|sd
B|Um, I do that a lot.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do spaghetti a lot.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it seems like most people like spaghetti.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because, um, I don't know,|h
B|I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess.|b
A|Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think that's right.|sv
B|And, um, we don't entertain that often,|sd
B|but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Most,|%
A|we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.|sd
A|It's usually friends from church and stuff,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things|sd
A|and everybody else brings something.|sd
B|That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,|sd
B|yeah.|aa
A|Oh yeah,|ba
A|yeah.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|It's a lot more relaxing.|sd
A|I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone.|sd
B|Well you see all that on T V|sd
B|and I could never be that person.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|It just, uh, I'm just not,|%
B|well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church|sd
B|and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff|sd
B|and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out|sd
B|and I don't know how she can do it and be calm|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|I guess,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Do you work?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I don't.|sd
A|Do you stay home with kids?|qy

A|we're going to have a baby this summer,|sd
A|and I'm not going to work anymore.|sd
B|Oh, how exciting.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
A|So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day.|sd
A|I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up|sd
A|and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather.|sd

A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|Uh, yeah,|b
B|I don't like the run in and out part.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened|sd
B|and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's neat.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things|sd
B|and I think that's good.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that really is.|sv
A|It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think,|%
A|Right now we eat in front of the T V|sd
A|but since it's just the two of us, it's|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|Well that happens to us sometimes too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,|sd
B|but we eat in the kitchen|sd
B|and their heads are always poking past the door.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|to see what's happening.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
B|Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing|sv
B|and some people don't like to do this|sv
B|but I like to uh, cook with my kids.|sv
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help.|sd
B|And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,|sd
B|I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it.|sd
A|Oh, I've seen those in the magazines.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they're so simple.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the kids love to do that.|sd
B|Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that|sd
B|and it's just really hard|sd
B|and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, that's, uh,|%
B|they like to eat it,|sd
B|but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that.|sd
A|Oh yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|we like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|My son's getting to be a, a real good cook|sd
B|so, uh,|%
A|Oh, neat.|ba

A|Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, not every morning, uh,|ng
B|mostly during the summer it's hit and miss|sd
B|and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the they like it all right.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, um, then sometimes we do something,|sd
B|it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,|sd
B|we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Oh, uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, I try to, uh,|%

A|Oh, do they get rubbery,|qy
A|or,|%
B|Um.|%
A|I've never tried it.|sd
B|It it depends.|no
B|If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray|sd
B|and they will be a little harder,|sd
B|and I don't like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,|sd
B|but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And let it steam.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then, and then stir it up.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|an, and that turns out okay.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|sd
B|It's really funny,|sv
B|it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that, you know,|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and yet if they don't ever see it, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know,|sd
B|so.|%

B|Anyway.|%
A|We had,|sd
A|my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash.|sd
