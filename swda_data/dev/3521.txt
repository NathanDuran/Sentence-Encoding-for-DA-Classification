B|and I like to listen to that and catch, you know,|sd
B|I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day.|sd

A|Was, was that the, the better paper|qy
A|or  ,|%
B|Yeah,|ny

B|It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy. Uh, which I like.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section.|sd
B|I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening pretty quick.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And I feel that the other newspaper, uh,|%
B|the the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.|sd
B|The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, is okay,|sv
B|but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion|sd
B|and,|%
A|But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES rather, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe?|qy

B|Right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Uh, I, I have a question.|sd
B|Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh,|qy

B|Is that, is that a correct assumption?|qy
A|That, that is certainly true.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, they will, they will have articles,|sd
