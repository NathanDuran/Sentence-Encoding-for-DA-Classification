B|But it's with women in it instead of men|sd
B|so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing.|sv
A|A switcheroo, huh?|bh
B|And it made me think a lot about, you know,|sd
B|you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this|sv
B|but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it.|sv
A|Right.|b

B|So, that was kind of interesting.|sd
B|I've,|%
B|but I really enjoyed it.|sd

B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's kind of what it was.|aa
A|but,|%

B|it was kind of,|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|Madonna she's pretty trashy.|sv
A|I can imagine.|ba
B|And so it was, it was interesting|sd
A|I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is, huh?|sv
B|well, I think she kept saying that, uh,|sd
B|they talked about her,|sd
B|it, it was a film of her concert, um, tour she had taken through all, all around the world.|sd
B|And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome,|sd

B|It had a social message to it|sd
B|and,|%
A|You just had to find it.|sv
A|You had to wade through it and find it|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|We never quite believed that,|sd
B|so.|%
A|You never quite got to,|sv
B|I thought that was pushing it a little bit|sv
B|but, she ,|%

A|Well, okay,|b
A|see, we're getting back to last year.|sd
A|That's probably the last movie I saw. Um, DANCES WITH WOLVES,|sd
A|I just adored it.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|How can I tell you.|^h
A|Um, a couple years ago, I guess, well, maybe ten years ago I, I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE|sd
A|and, so, you know, just the general theme of the whole movie was, um, pretty,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean I really liked it a lot.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess.|sv
A|Um, and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood, you know, about the American pop, Indian population,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and then everything went away for a couple years,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and now it's back again.|sv
A|And, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, um, what happened way back then.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Of course, no one will ever know.|sv
A|Really I don't|h
B|I know,|aa
B|I was,|%
B|I wondered if, uh, the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be.|qh
A|Well, who knows.|no
A|I mean it, it, it sort of showed like two different types of tribes|sd
A|like one was a warring tribe,|sd
A|and the other one was, uh, vegetarian kind of, you know, feel good tribe. You know, sort of thing,|sd
B|Right|b
A|so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Nobody can get along peacefully|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but I wonder|%
B|I thought|%
B|because they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the, the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe|sv
B|and that, you know, that was so wonderful that they done that|sv
B|and they, uh, uh, I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film,|qh
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|if it,|%
B|you know, you didn't, hear any press about that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Huh.|b

A|Well, I think so.|aa
A|I, um, I have come to respect a little bit more the, uh, you know, what went on here,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but, but who knows how it's supposed to all end|qh
B|Uh-huh|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|You know on the, on the broad scope I mean, um, like if, uh, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I|sv
A|meaning to me|%
A|I think about, you know, just the meaning of, um, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms. And sort of trampling that|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, so you know it, it meant something bigger I think.|sv
A|But still it was a|sv
A|I loved the buffalo scene.|sd
A|And I thought Kevin Costner was just,|sv
A|I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every, three minutes,|sv
B|I know the|aa
A|but he's the director, you know.|sd
A|Um, but, yeah,|%
A|I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.|sv
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.|sv
B|That was, that was, it was, it was good.|ba
B|I looked at my watch only a few times, which is a good thing.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Ate a lot of popcorn.|sd
B|But it put me in a really, it put me in a really bad mood,|sd
B|I don't know why.|sd
A|Did it really?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we|%
B|there were three of us who went.|sd
B|We were just all really grouchy when it was over.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So we decided that may be the mark of a good film.|sd
B|It made us think.|sd
B|And so,|%
A|It made you think.|bf
B|we were grouchy.|sd
B|We felt guilty for being,|sd
A|Maybe well, maybe that was, um,|sv
A|but there are no answers, you know.|sv
B|I know|aa
B|and we, we had nothing to do with it.|sd
A|That, that can make you crabby, yes.|sv
B|We were not responsible,|sd
B|but we still felt the thick blame for, what had gone on.|sd
A|Really,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|We could have,|%
A|But it, it's,|%
A|they sort of candy coated the western story for many years,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, um, you know, when the truth, oh, well,|sv

B|or he works in a, a movie theater and it it helps the projectionist.|sd
B|There's a little, oh, an old man who's the projectionist|sd

A|Oh.|b
B|And it's just,|%
B|I mean, if you don't mind reading subtitles,|sd
B|I thought I had to kind of get beyond that.|sd
B|Those little, you know,|sd
B|reading the little words at the bottom of the screen|sd
B|but, um, oh, I just laughed and cried|sd
