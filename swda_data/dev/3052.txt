B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|well the topic is selecting care for the elderly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future.|sd
B|What about yourself?|qo
A|Well, my parents are both in their seventies.|sd
A|My, my mother and stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies.|sd
A|And, my, uh, uh, father and stepmother are not in very good health.|sd
A|So this is something that is,|sd
B|A concern of yours right now.|qy^d
A|Yes,|ny
A|it is.|sd
B|Are, are they living independently, right now?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|they are.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|They are.|sd
B|Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?|qy
A|Not for them, my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home.|ng
A|Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms|sd
A|and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.|sd
A|And, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care|sd
A|and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds the ultimate.|ba
A|Unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.|sd
B|Well, even at that point, most care can be given at, in the home.|sv
B|That sound like just an excellent solution.|ba
B|You must feel real good about that.|qy^d
A|Well, I, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.|arp_nd
A|I, uh, I read a lot|sd
A|and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes|sd
A|and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them.|sd
A|And, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time|sd
A|and they have, uh,|%
A|even the people that are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are incapacitated. Go and, uh, participate in olympics|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, so there are a lot of, a lot of activities going on all the time|sd
A|and this is a nursing home,|sd
A|it's not a senior citizens home.|sd
A|So that the people are really, uh,|sd
B|Really in need of a nursing home.|^2
A|Right.|aa
A|They need,  the nursing care,|sd
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, but it's a very expensive solution.|sv
B|Well, it's, you know,|aa
B|I think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.|sv
B|It's just a matter of finding, a good home.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able to afford either of those solutions.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|And that, I think is what is scary,|sv
B|and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes|sv
B|and they really can not afford the best.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|And that's right, I, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation|sd
A|and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,|sd
A|but when they, the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware,|sd
A|I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance|sd
A|and I overheard their conversation.|sd
A|And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what had happened.|sd
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|So, I told them he strangled on some chicken|sd
A|and, uh, they said, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and I thought|%
B|What a shame,|ba
B|they put him in the home so that he could be cared for|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|and then  they could have done that well at home.|sv
A|And then she was  upset,|sd
A|he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his.|sd
A|He had on a pair, of slacks,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and the wife said "these are not his slacks"|sd
A|and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."|sd
A|And,|%
B|You hear these stories, all the time.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, I, this was just something that I  was,  I witnessed to.|sd
B|You happened,|%
B|Right.|b
A|And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.|sd
A|And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,|sd
A|and he was definitely,|sd
A|just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care,|sd
A|but the family were all talking about, uh, putting him in another home.|sd
A|They said he will not go back to that one.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
B|Good,|ba
B|I'm glad they have a solution. To do that,|sd
A|I'm glad they the option.|sd
B|yes.|aa
B|I know.|aa
A|I, I would hate  to be in a position where that was all I could afford|sd
A|and there were not, there was no choice.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
B|My, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be seven, eight years,|sd
B|and,  uh, and, uh,  It's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
A|Um.|b
B|As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from,  from people  who have been independent all their lives.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Like this was a really neat vital woman|sd
B|and you get in a nursing home|sv
B|and the first thing that happens you have to share your, your whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your  life.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And oh I, I do not know what the answer is,|sd
B|but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there|sv
B|and it, I think it does,|%
B|a lot of it goes down to just money. And family support,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|uh, if you, you know, have family that, uh,  you can live with.|sv
A|Visits everyday.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|I, I really,|%
B|I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know.|sv
B|You would do your research|sv
B|and you would go  visit.|sv
A|Visit,|b^m
A|right.|aa
B|And, uh, hopefully, they would have, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit|sv
A|Suspicious.|^2
B|right.|aa
A|You know, I, I, my, I remember my, my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died|sd
A|and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time,|sd
A|but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything,|sd
A|she really was not aware of what she was doing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I I can remember she had several strokes|sd
A|and the nursing home was right next to a hospital|sd
A|and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days.|sd
A|And it was, she was, it was just like keeping something.|sd
