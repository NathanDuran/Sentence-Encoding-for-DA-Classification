B|Yes, sir.|ba
A|What kind of dining out do you like?|qw
B|Well, there is two kinds.|sd
B|One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant.|sd
A|Oh.|b

B|but it's, uh, not part of a chain|sd
B|it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.|sd
B|But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had|sd
