A|but our crimes up here, uh, as I think it must be in most cities now,|sv
A|but, uh, I was listening to the news the other day|sd

A|MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation.|sd
A|I think it's a pretty good,|sd
A|it's a locally owned paper.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, uh, L A, or somewhere.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|But,|%

A|I think, uh, the thing that makes a lot of noise would, would suffice.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I really do.|sv
A|But, uh, this deal that was part of it for, you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|whether it,|%
B|so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|qy
B|And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?|qw

B|How does it do that?|qw
A|Who knows, you know.|no
