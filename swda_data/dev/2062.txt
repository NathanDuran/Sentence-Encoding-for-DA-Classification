A|Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?|qo
B|Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,|%
B|of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package|sv
B|and I think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,|sv
B|besides, they tend to offer adequate vacation, I guess.|sv
B|And the paid time off is wonderful,|sv
B|and, uh, one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered|sd
B|and I think that is just a, a fabulous one,|sv
B|so. I don't know if you participate in that or not,|qy^d
B|but|%
A|Absolutely.|ny
B|isn't it great?|qy
B|It's just a, it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up, you know.|sv
A|Well, I have to agree with that.|aa
A|You know, I was thinking about, uh, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while I was waiting for, uh, the system to find a, a respondent.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed|sd
A|and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|When I was much younger it was, uh, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.|sd
A|But as I grow older and my family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important|sd
A|and the retirement is more important.|sd
B|I had never really thought of it that way|ba
B|but I guess that's true, I guess that's true.|aa
B|I'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me|sd
B|and the paid time off is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.|sd
B|But, uh, you know, I was just, as a matter of fact, I just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, uh, kind of started looking through the, the book because of that, you know,|sd
B|now that I'm a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean and what is the pension all about|sd
B|and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,|%
B|I'm only in my late twenties now,|sd
B|so you tend not to think about retirement.|sd
B|But, uh, it's,|%
B|I guess now is the time to think about it,|sd
B|so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?|qy
A|I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.|na
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it's not, uh,|%
A|all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.|sd
B|It's not going to build up, quite enough,|sd
B|yeah.|aa
A|So, I have to find a way to supplement that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save.|sv
B|You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,|%
B|but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.|sd
B|And it's probably not a great investment,|sv
B|but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.|sd
B|I kind of have to trade off, you know.|sd
B|If you never see it you don't spend it,|sv
B|so And it's,|%
A|I understand though,|ba
A|it,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, believe me, I do that myself.|sd
B|Do you?|bh
B|Yeah?|bh
A|And I disagree with you.|ar
A|I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world.|sd
B|Do you really not?|bh
B|I, I, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.|sd
A|Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment|%
A|and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
B|That's very true.|aa
B|We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas|sd
B|and, uh, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know,|sd
B|they work up this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do.|sd
B|And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.|sd
B|We have a two year old, you know,|sd
B|and, and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,|sd
B|we have to do that now.|sd
B|And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,|sd
B|and he's two now,|sd
B|in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,|sd
B|and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to,|sd
B|it's, what it costs now is ridiculous,|sd
B|what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.|sd
B|And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college.|sd
B|And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.|sd
B|So, I guess it, you know,|%
B|in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know.|sd
B|We, we can worry about other things|sd
B|so,|%
A|I understand, that approach.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Is it really?|bh
B|Yeah.|b
A|except that mine are a little bit older|sd
A|and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,|sd
A|all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.|^q
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
B|Well, that's what she said to us.|sd
B|She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?|sd
B|And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college.|sd
B|And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.|sd
B|And that was kind of our view on it.|sd
B|It just costs too much,|sv
B|you just can't do it, you know.|sv
B|So, I don't know,|h
B|it's, it's,|%
B|I don't, uh,|%
B|it just amazing,|%
B|it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.|sd
B|I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.|sv
A|And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.|sd
A|Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,|sd
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|and I said, that's wonderful.|sd
A|I applaud that.|^q
A|Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Exactly.|ba
A|And, then her little brother's only two years behind|sd
B|Exactly.|ba
A|and he says, well, I don't know,|sd
A|I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.|^q
A|And I said, that's great.|sd
A|Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q
B|That's right,|aa
B|That's right|aa
B|Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff|sv
B|and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,|sv
B|but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go.|sv
B|I have, you know, all,|%
B|this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've|sd
B|always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms|sd
B|and so I've never had the, the big benefit package.|sd
B|So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.|sd
B|It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered.|sd
B|So, I've been real pleased.|sd
A|Well, that's fantastic,|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.|sv
B|Think so?|bh
A|Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and you can pick what you want|sv
B|and, yeah.|aa
A|now it's up to you|ad
A|it's menu selection, so, to speak.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|That sounds really good.|ba
B|I read a thing,|sd
B|I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you,|sd
B|and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea.|sd
B|You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation|sd
B|but that's really not enough|sv
B|and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year|sd
B|and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,|sd
B|and they're deducting it all along,|sd
B|so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,|sd
B|you're really not being paid for them,|sd
B|the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,|sd
B|but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.|sd
B|So, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in|sd
B|and T I said that they were looking into something like that|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.|sv
B|Well,|%
B|true.|aa
B|True.|aa
A|Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one|sv
A|or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. Uh, as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate uh, that's running in each department.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well,|%
B|and, yeah,|%
B|and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person|sd
B|and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.|sd
B|But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.|sd
B|It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get|sv
B|so,|%
A|Well, that's for sure.|aa
B|Which is the same,|sv
B|but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,|sv
B|that's,|%
A|Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, just in this size of organization,|%
