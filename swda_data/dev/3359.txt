A|Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater,|sd
B|Well, I, I try to be as well,|sd

B|Oh, you're in New York,|sd
B|I was going to,|sd
B|there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it is absolutely wonderful.|sv
A|Really.|b
B|And, uh, we were there a few months ago,|sd
B|and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,|sv
B|well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,|sv
B|but|%
A|Oh, no,|ar
A|I'm in upstate New York,|sd
A|and it's actually very inexpensive,|sd
A|I,|%
A|there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards,|sd
B|Oh, is it, okay.|ba
B|Wow.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,|sd
B|and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,|sd
B|but it is absolutely wonderful.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|It's the best I have ever had.|sd
A|Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,|sd

A|No,|b
A|no,|b
A|I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,|sd

A|That's true.|aa
B|But it sure is good,|sv
B|and it's supposed to be good for you.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically|sd
B|Right.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|But I like it hot,|sd
B|but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|My, generally my, my scalp will start,|sd
A|I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't know,|h
A|but, uh,|%
A|yeah,|%

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,|sd
A|well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances,|sd

B|Oh, yeah,|b
A|that's one thing,|sd
B|and the price.  And the price. Make you want to come back.|^2
