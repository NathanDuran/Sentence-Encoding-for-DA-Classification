A|Yeah.|b
B|We don't, we don't have that luxury.|sd
B|But, we have lots of friends,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I think because she is, uh, the only child that they concentrate, uh, they would like to have more,|sd
A|but that hasn't been, uh, possible.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, she's tried many, uh, avenues|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and so now it's just, you know, that she's kind of resolved herself that, yes, this is going to be the only one|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and she devotes,|bf
B|yeah.|aa
A|And they're focusing on all of her, uh, welfare.|sd

B|and my stepdaughter plays softball|sd
B|so we, we tend to do a lot of running.|sd
B|Things are very different nowadays than when I grew up|sv
A|Oh, they are.|aa
B|and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know,|sv
B|I don't remember doing all these things.|sd
A|No.|aa
B|I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,|sd
B|but we had more, I guess family time alone where we did nothing. Which was good.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you're,|%
A|Now I think everything is doing, doing, doing, out of the house. Which can be very hectic.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|It can be|aa
B|and, and sometimes I, you know, I kind of long for the good old days when we didn't do all these running.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it wasn't so|bf
B|But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents|sd
B|and we've had a lot of fun with that, too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|You have to look on that, on the, uh, positive side of that.|sv
B|It's just different.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|it is.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's just a different lifestyle.|bf

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I know where you're coming from|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's, it's very nice.|sv
B|It is very nice.|aa
A|I think, uh, uh, those type of children, uh, that are involved in things like that, their, uh, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.|sv
B|Well, I think so,|aa
B|and, and I think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, your band, your your sports team you know, you all have to pull together.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Going to,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh,|%
A|A, a, a team effort,|bf
A|yes.|%
B|Yeah,|aa

A|That, That's wonderful.|ba
B|And, uh,|%
A|That's really is nice to have in your background, that, you know, then you can, you're, you can be very flexible.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, there's less, uh, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|yes.|aa
A|And I think it's a step, a, a giant step of progress, I really do.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
A|So, uh, I,|%
B|Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.|ad
B|What is the best advice of mothering that you know?|qw
A|The best of, Well, uh, Cathy, I think if you look to the Word of God and, uh, think on the things that are pure and lovely|sv
B|Besides don't sweat the small stuff|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's good, that's real good advice.|sv
A|and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And keep your mind on positive things|ad
A|and, and stress that to your children.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, even if they're, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are, uh, not negative and that are positive things in their life|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern|sv
A|and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|Well, I would agree with that.|aa
B|We're also real active in our church|sd
B|and my kids do an awful lot with that.|sd
B|Allyson sings in the choir.|sd
B|I told her that's a gift from God|sd
B|and you need to return that back.|^q
A|Oh, absolutely.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|And you owe, you owe that back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent|^q
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and and that's real nice.|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|I'm real proud of her.|sd
B|I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing.|sd
B|You know, that's, that's real neat.|sd
A|Well, if she looks, if she looks at it as you suggest that, that that's, that she can give her, her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and, and, uh, that's ...|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
