A|well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex,|sd
B|you know, there's so much going on here.|sv
A|I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.|sd
B|Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|golly|ba
A|I know.|aa
B|and,|%
A|Have they done that in Garland?|qy
B|No,|nn

A|Now, um,|%
B|I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so, um,|%
A|Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school,|sd
A|so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|So. Yeah,|b
A|it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school|sd
A|and you wonder if he's going to get shot.|sd
A|I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.|sd
B|I know|aa
A|What next?|qh
B|I know,|aa
B|it's, it's, it's getting,|sv
B|it's been out of hand, I think, for a while,|sv
B|and it just continues to get worse.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this,|sv
A|they just can't do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's,|%
B|I|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right|b
A|and,|%
B|and that may impact it as well.|sv
A|I think so,|aa
A|and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all|sv
B|Yeah|aa
A|I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.|sv
B|they don't think twice about it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,|h
A|I think it was just rare,|sv
A|I really do.|sv

B|Oh, wow,|ba
