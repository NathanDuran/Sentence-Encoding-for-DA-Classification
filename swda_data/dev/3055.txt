A|And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something, um.|oo_co_cc
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh-huh.|b
B|sure.|b
B|Right,|b
A|Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|No,|nn
A|nor am I.|sd
B|I avoid them with all|sd
A|They are a lot of work,|sv
A|that is for sure.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they are,|aa
B|I mean I do them,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|but they are a lot of work.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I usually have them when I, there is a special event in our lives|sd
B|and I, I make a big deal out of it for them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right,|b
A|yes.|b
B|You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust|sd
B|and, you know, I can make my pies from scratch,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do not need a recipe to follow.|sd
B|And, uh,|%
A|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|You sound like my mother who has been,|sd
A|well I bake pies too,|sd
A|but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family|sd
A|and she has the same, the same technique,|sd
A|I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just,  kind of do it second nature.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|you just know from heart.|^2
B|I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie|sd
B|and she said make me one,|sd
B|and I made her one.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody".|sd
B|And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.|sd
A|She enjoyed it, huh|qy
B|Yes|ny
A|Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we had a, a, an auction one time at the church|sd
A|excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars|sd
B|My word,|ba
B|she must have a great pie recipe then.|sv
A|Well, I think I, I have had it once|sd
A|and it has been a few years ago,|sd
A|but I do recall that it was quite good,|sd
A|so, uh,|%
B|Wonderful.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, that is her specialty, uh,|sd
A|I like to bake, uh, also,|sd
A|I do not bake so much now that my children are grown,|sd
A|but I do enjoy baking|sd
A|and I guess I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that,|sd
A|that was more my specialty, I suppose.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And they seem to last longer than pies around here|sd
A|pies would go practically, in a day's time|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|you,|%
B|That's right,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|they are meant for the, that evening's, dessert|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you know, the leftovers.|sd
A|Right|b
B|Puts about two more inches on his waistline|sd
B|and then  he is chastising,  himself afterward|sd
A|And ,|%
A|Well, it is interesting that,|sd
A|yesterday, I had lunch with a friend|sd
A|and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|For, um, uh,|%
A|one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town|sd
A|and, uh, they invited two other couples over|sd
A|and so there were seven of them that, uh,|sd
A|I said "well, what did you have"|sd
A|and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food,|sd
A|but, you know, she had, uh, uh, guacamole|sd
A|and, uh, I cannot remember all she had.|sd
A|But she also had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.|sd
A|Have you ever made that or had it?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I have not,|sd
B|huh-uh.|nn
A|It's, uh, it's, um,|%
A|I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's just a wonderful dessert.|sd
A|It's like, uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to make,|sd
A|but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago.|sd
A|And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that you get, there.|sd
B|Like apple pie in America,|bf
B|right.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wow,|ba
B|uh-huh.|b
A|It's just very customary to get flan.|sd
A|So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner,|sd
A|but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.|sd
A|But|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|flan is something you can, make ahead and have just, you know, have ready|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh. Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon,|sd
A|but I tell you it,|%
A|I|%

A|you don't just make the dinner,|sv
A|you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.|sv
B|Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Probably a good way to do it.|aa
A|Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party|sd
B|Yeah,|b

A|my husband and I have been married twenty six years,|sd
A|and until last year I had never had another person clean my house,|sd
A|and, then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, I had a woman come in, uh, once a month,|sd
A|and you know, it was not just very often,|sd
A|but for me it was wonderful|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah|b
B|that is nice, you know, to have that,|sd
B|that's a, luxury, today.|sv
A|Well,|%
A|it is,|aa
A|and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party,  I guess.|sv
B|That's  right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, well, uh, I,|%
B|I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have heard about that.|sd
B|Have you?|qy
A|but I have never tried it.|sd
A|No,|nn
A|well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it,|sd
A|I do not know that it has egg in it.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you have it right on the top of you head?|qy

B|no.|nn
A|You do not have it,|sd
A|yeah.|%
A|I would ,|%
B|Well, it,|%
B|like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and you mix that together|sd
B|and then you, you know, your,|%
B|see it makes, it makes, uh, five pie crusts at once.|sd
A|Uh, quite large,|ba
A|yeah.|%
B|So, that,|%
B|it's quite a volume of,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I think it's four cups of floor,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, like, uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar|sd
B|and, and you combine your dry ingredients|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then you, uh, put in your liquid.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes, the crust better.|qy
B|It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,|sd
A|Uh.|b
A|Interesting.|ba
B|and, you can really treat it rough|sd
B|and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|boy, that, that's the real secret.|ba
B|Like, uh, it's not mine,|sd
B|it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago|sd

B|and, it will still be flaky.|sd
B|I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.|sd

A|Those were the toughest apple crust, or apple, uh, pie crust, I have ever, ever made.|sd
