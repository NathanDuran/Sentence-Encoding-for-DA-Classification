B|What, what,|%
B|how do you get your main source of current events?|qw
A|Well, uh, until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL,|sd
A|and I thought that was a good way,|sd
A|but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things.|sd
A|You know, it's a week or two late,|sd
A|but, uh, that's how I'm staying up.|sd
B|I either watch the news|sd
B|or, or occasionally I'll read the paper.|sd
A|Uh, do you like how it's presented on the news?|qy
B|Um, no,|nn
B|I think the media's a little bit too manipulative.|sv
B|They allow you, uh,|sv
B|they, they try to lead you too much, I believe,|sv
B|and sometimes they're not very open,|sv
B|I, I don't know,|sd
B|I think they're a little bit biased sometimes.|sv
B|Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case.|sd
B|The coverage on that was, you know,|sv
B|when it first happened it was, he was guilty, he was guilty, he was guilty.|sd
B|You know, they try to have you form opinions or whatever,|sv
B|and then I, I didn't like the the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that.|sd
B|You know, basically I, I, I think they don't present the, the whole sides of, of everything.|sv
A|So, it, it makes you feel like they're, uh, wanting you to take their opinion.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|It's, it's, it's, instead of reporting the news, it's more like an editorial, I believe on a lot of issues.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I've noticed that too,|sd
A|and it's kind of distressing, isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|And they just, I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words, uh, usually, uh, just that sway the whole, uh, report that, you know, by just a couple of words.|sv
B|Well, when, when I was in school, I, um, I was a communications major,|sd
B|so I, I, I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking, and, and so forth|sd
A|So, communications, huh.|bf
A|Were you looking into becoming a reporter|qy
A|or,|%
B|I was,|na
B|and, um, I I ventured off in a whole entire different field, field.|sd
B|I went with the state.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I, um, went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability,|sd
B|calculate benefits.|sd
A|I bet that's a interesting job.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
B|So the,|%
B|so, and, you know, working, you know, working for state government you hear all about current events, about things going on within the state itself.|sd
B|So that, that's another source that I, I, where I keep up with current events|sd
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's one that I'm reading right now.|sd
A|It's INFORMATION WEEK.|sd
A|It says A T and T to account for the, the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability.|sd
A|It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three, to account for that.|sd
B|It's a lot of money.|ba
A|And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.|sd
B|It's a lot of money.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|sd
A|And, yeah, you have to stay up on stuff,|sv
A|and I bet in your, your job that you have to,|sd
A|do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|well, no,|nn
B|I, I, I primarily deal with the state employees,|sd
B|but I, I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the, like the state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.|sd
B|And I really know what the budget is,|sd
B|and, and, uh, uh, when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes, and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that,|sd
B|and, you know, I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has,|sd
B|and it, it's just funny.|sv
B|You know, so that's, that's, that's,|%
B|so I don't have a whole lot of faith in, in, you know, the news.|sd
B|Course it's,|%
B|they, they get what they hear from,|sv
B|but, you know, it's not always I, I think one hundred percent reliable.|sv
A|Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective?|qo
B|I think they need to do a little bit, go into a little bit more depth, uh, before they would just report, like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that,|sv
B|because I mean, another example is the, uh, AIDS issue or whatever.|sd
B|You know, someone said, Oh, I found a cure.|sd
B|They immediately,|%
B|the headlines on the news or whatever is, Someone says they found a cure for AIDS.|sd
B|And then two months later it's discovered it's not, you know,|sd
B|before they, before they come out with something like that they need to, to research the matter, I believe, a little bit more.|sd
A|I guess they do that so they don't get scooped, you know,|sv
A|so they have the big story.|sv
B|Well, that,|%
B|well, yeah|aa
B|I, I,|%
B|it,|%
B|I think the,|%
