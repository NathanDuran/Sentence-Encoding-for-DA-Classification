A|Uh, well, uh, to begin,|%
A|I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,|sv
A|so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess.|sv
A|So.|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree|aa
A|Uh.|%
B|it's definitely new frontier stuff.|sv
A|So, uh,|%
A|but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space frontier,|h
A|but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.|sv
A|Um, Star Wars is not too far I don't think.|sv
A|But, uh,|%
B|I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time.|sd
A|Oh, have you.|qh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|So what do you know about it.|qw
B|Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.|sd
B|I get on a computer network all the time,|sd
B|and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.|sd
B|They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,|sd
B|it's like they, take off, you know,|sd
B|and then they land, with the, with the, you know,|sd
B|the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad.|sd
A|Really.|b
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's called V C X or something like that.|sd
B|Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|Well, I don't know.|h
A|You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?|qy
B|Oh, yeah|ny
A|Do you,|bh
B|I think I would.|sd
B|I think that'd be neat.|sv
A|I think I would just sitting here talking about it,|sv
A|but if the time came, it'd be real nervous.|sv
A|I'd be scared,|sd
A|scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.|sd
A|That'd be pretty hairy.|sv
B|Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,|sd
B|so you know, I, like I know what it's like to|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|imagine.|ba
B|Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they're talking about doing that again, too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.|sv
B|Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.|sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|and they're going to put,|sd
A|That's all beyond my imagination really.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, science fiction books,|sd

A|so you never know.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those,|sv
A|so,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you never know what, what may occur,|sv
A|but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know,|sd
A|but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, uh,|%
B|it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,|sv
B|it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,|sv
A|but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I wish, uh,|sd
B|like, uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they'd go up, you know, and do things|sd
B|and,|%
A|So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about the "they" in this sentence should probably be a Russia and all that?|qy
B|Oh.|b
B|No,|nn
B|it's still probably going,|sv
B|but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know,|sd
A|and then,|%
B|But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles,|sd
B|they're still going to be subs and things.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and we don't know who's handling them now|sd
