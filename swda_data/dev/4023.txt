A|, how do you feel about crime in the city?|qo
A|You say you're from Atlanta.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|I, I, I actually I live in the city|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I guess it is a concern of mine, uh, you know, for my own safety.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, do you, do you find crime in Atlanta really|qy
A|I live in Atlanta also.|sd
B|Well that's right. Uh, I think it is bad in certain areas, *sv|ba
A|Uh.|%
B|however I think, the area that I live in it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused uh.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?|qw
B|Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,|sv
B|and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .|sv
A|I probably agree with that.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.|sv
B|They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's probably true.|aap_am
A|Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?|qy
B|Um, well, I've been to,|%
B|I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.|na
B|Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't think it's as bad as L A either.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|We, I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that seems to be true.|aa
B|Um, yeah,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's that obvious.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|You know, walk you know, walk with, you know, with just walk in a confidently,|sv

B|Right.|b
B|Sure.|ba
B|Right,|aa
B|don't, don't walk down a, an alley|sv
