A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Oh, no.|ba
A|And it's just been tearing me up all day|sd
B|Oh, I bet.|ba
A|Because we have just been looking all over for him.|sd

A|we've been to the humane society,|sd
A|we've been to the adoption center,|sd
A|we've just been all over the neighborhood,|sd

B|Have you lost him before?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|this is the first time.|sd
A|Um, he's gotten out before,|sd
A|but he's always stayed right here you know,|sd

A|I always forget|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, Australian shepherd.|sd
B|Oh,|bk
B|boy, he's a big one.|qy^d
A|he's pretty big.|sd
A|That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before,|sd
A|and, I would think, you know, he might, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something.|sd
A|I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, but, I don't know|h

B|Oh.|b
A|You know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this|sd
B|Oh, that's really too bad,|ba
B|that's awful, well,|ba
A|Uh, I, I just knew today, uh, you know, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,|sd
A|and I knew we were going to find him, you know,|sd
A|and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,|sd

B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|I, we will probably will put some things up. Some posters and stuff up|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|And hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.|sd
A|But, we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood,|sd
A|so that helps, too, you know, if they can keep,|sd
B|They can keep their eyes open,|^2
B|yeah.|%
A|yeah,|b^m
A|so,|%
B|That will help.|sv
B|Well,|%

B|Yeah.|b
A|You know. I really do, because he knows exactly where he lives,|sd
A|so|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b

B|Yeah,|aa
B|isn't it, though?|bh
A|I know,|na
B|That's,|%
A|it's very strange|sd
A|but,|%
B|You know, I know sometimes our cat will, will stay out all night,|sd
B|and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him|sd
B|and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then I really get scared.|sd
B|But he's always come back eventually|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|That's one thing about cats though,|sv
A|they're so small|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, you know, they can get hurt a lot easier.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, they can get hurt a lot easier, you know,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|they can.|aa
A|so that would make you really, tend to worry about them you know, if they're not right there|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Well, but he's a real feisty guy.|sd
B|He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|He's,|%
B|cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.|sd

B|They're very, very|%
B|he, he just|%
B|any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,|sd
B|but he'll sit|sd
B|and he'll watch,|sd
B|and, I think maybe he would if it came real close,|sd
B|but he's very protective of our property.|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|That's really,|%
A|I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I never had them growing up,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, you know, I never really had them around me, you know,|sd
A|so I've never owned one you know, since I,|sd
B|Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're very independent,|sd
B|and they're very, he's very affectionate when he wants to be,|sd
B|but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be, he'll just, he'll, you know either scratch you or run away.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|But when he wants to be, uh, he's really affectionate.|sd
B|He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and, and, and snuggle up to you,|sd
B|and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.|sd
A|Huh|b
B|But, dogs seem to be always in the mood.|sv
B|They're always, you know, right there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true|aa

B|yeah, oh.|b
A|that,|%
A|and, uh, most dogs do that.|sv
A|I mean,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they do.|aa
A|I don't know any that really don't.|sd
A|I mean, you know, they know exactly how to get that attention, you know,|sv
B|They sure do.|aa
A|they just, you know, come up,|sv
A|and they put your, you know|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know|sv
B|Now, do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go|qy

B|You have a fenced yard or,|qy
A|Uh-huh,|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|yeah.|ny
A|The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.|sd
A|That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know, because he's had all this room to run in,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, but,|%
B|Well, how did he get out?|qw
A|He dug a hole under the fence.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba

A|He did it again|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so we chained him up|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|So, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire|sd
B|Oh.|bk
