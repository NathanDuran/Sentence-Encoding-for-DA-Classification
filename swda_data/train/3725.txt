A|Yeah,|ny
A|we have a pretty big family,|sd
A|but most of us,|%
A|well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Most everybody is right in that area.|sd
B|That makes it a lot easier.|sv
B|A lot more convenient.|sv
B|That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|because it is always that hard to get everyone together.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|They put one together for our family about once every June.|sd
A|It was on my grandmother's birthday,|sd
A|but she is, she is gone now.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|see that is kind of what happened with ours.|sd
B|That is why we have not had one in a long time.|sd

B|Eat a lot.|qy^d
A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh,  vacation time.|sd
A|Schedule vacation  time|b
A|and yeah.|b
A|We|%
A|uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon.|sd

B|Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically.|sd
