B|And, and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,|bf
A|Yeah.|b
B|that's what, that's what people face with that choice.|sd
B|One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know,|sv
B|they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know,|sd

B|I think people know that nobody, that it doesn't, you know,|sv
B|it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|And, I mean, it sounds horrible.|sv
B|It,|%
B|I hear myself saying this,|sd
B|and, but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|But it's,|%

A|And as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is.|sd
A|You know, I, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think I think Texas is Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty,|sd
B|and I think, I know California had it for a long time,|sd
B|and then they, uh, took it off the books,|sd
B|they repealed it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and people like Charles Manson, and, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now, now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes.|sd
B|The people who were there originally, when they, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are still in there for, are in prison, in quote, for life, and, and are now coming up for parole,|sd

B|and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies,|sd
B|and then they reinstated it later,|sd
B|but the penalty didn't go back. You know?|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.|sv
A|Yes.|b
A|The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And the, the laws are all, the rules.|%
B|Some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then he gets up for this one trial,|sd
B|and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so they say, well, this is, you know,|%
B|I, I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever,|sd
B|but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.|sd
A|Or, you know, plead insanity.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah. Well,|b
B|To some extent if they would do something with some of those people.|%
B|But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.|sv
A|Oh yes,|b
B|They plead insanity|sd
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.|sd
