A|You want to go first?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|you can start|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I really don't agree with that|sv
A|I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible.|sv
A|I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|you know what I mean?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|There's, there, this topic is kind of mute.  Uh|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|there, there's no way.|sv
B|We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.|sv
A|That's it.|aa
B|Uh, every person has their opinions|sd
B|and that's why jury selection is often very difficult.  Uh.|sv
A|Well,  I, I feel the other thing too, uh,|sd
A|they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system.|sd
A|I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal,|sv
A|I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question|sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's beyond a reasonable doubt.|sd
A|You know, all these things.|sd
A|I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|They shouldn't allow  an appeal.|bf
A|And  it can go on for ten, twenty, years.|sd
B|Yep.|b
A|I, I  think this is a little ridiculous.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.|sv
B|Oh, that's right.|aa
B|I work for a law firm|sd
A|I, I'm  serious.|sd
A|And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, if  someone is|%
B|Well plea  plea bargaining is a different story.|sd
A|Well.|b
B|Plea bargaining is something completely different.|sv
B|That, that actually prevents trials.  Or at least speeds them up.|sv
A|Well, I know.|aa
A|That's what I'm  saying.|sd
A|But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard.|sv
A|I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they,|sd
A|I don't know how it works exactly|h
A|but  you know, they get lesser sentences|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know,  uh  and that they have to do something.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.|sv
B|Huh.|%
A|you know what I'm saying?|qy
A|That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh I, I think they should.|sv
B|We do|sd
A|I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people|sv
A|and, uh, you know, all|%
B|Right.|b
A|they, they're caught dead to rights.|sd
A|I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life|sv
A|and if, they should pay for it with their life.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We just have the case,|sd
B|I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|So, I mean, his appeal was denied|sd
B|and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.|sd
A|It, uh,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, that was absurd|sv
B|There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.|sv
A|I know that, that|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I don't know.|h
A|Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?|qw
B|Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,|%
B|the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of.|sd
B|Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd.|sv
B|There's no way that could work.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|I, I,  I don't agree with that at all.|sd
B|Uh, but,|%
A|Imagine the guilt that person would have.|ad
A|I  mean  burned out.|sv
B|Oh, exactly.|aa
A|There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|If you had to do something like that, day after day.|sv
B|No one would want the job|sv
A|No.|aa
A|Not really.|aa
B|Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.|sd
A|Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,|qy
B|Oh yeah.|ny
B|I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury.|sv
B|That, that, that right|%
A|I mean, supposing  I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.|sd
B|Well, I mean, were  there witnesses?|qy
A|In other words  you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances  were.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances|sv
A|Well, I, I,|%
