A|return anything.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well,  really,  the only things that I have returned have not been faulty,|sd
B|it's been because of the size or  some  problem like that.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to.|sd
A|Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee,|sv
A|yeah.|%
A|The only thing I've had lately is, uh, my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for, uh, Christmas|sd
A|and, uh, it takes them less than a day|sd
A|and they're broken in one way or another.|sd
A|But I don't know if that's just kids, or if that's, uh,|sd
A|maybe those type of products should be for older kids|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What age are your children?|qw
A|I have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And, uh, I don't think they're unduly rough,|sd
A|but maybe they are.|sd
A|I don't know.|h
A|But, uh, a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces|sd
A|and they're easily lost and easily broken|sd
A|but,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well,  my daughter is twenty-one now,|sd
B|so it's been a while since we've had  Barbie things|sd
A|It's been a while since they've, uh,  gone through the Barbie stuff  .|bf
B|But we  did have Barbies, we did have Barbies and things,|sd
B|and there|%
B|seems to me that that became a craze when she was already, oh, like, you know, third, fourth, fifth grade.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it,|sd
B|but, uh, I don't remember her  breaking a lot of stuff.|sd
A|Don't remember her  breaking, uh,|b^m
B|No,|nn
B|I don't.|sd
B|But I also don't remember lots of little pieces|sd
B|They've got so many different things with it now.|sv
A|Well, that's one thing they've got.|aa
A|They've  got every type of imaginable,|sv
A|camping on the beach, and all of these come with, oh, like tiny, tiny little plates and little sunglasses.|sd
A|And, uh|%
B|Goodness.|ba
A|my  three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll,|sd
A|and so I finally got her a Ken doll,|sd
A|and, uh, less than a week later the arm was broken.|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|But they were real good about replacing it.|sd
A|That's one nice thing, is they're real good about replacing it.|sd
B|Well, uh, I guess if they'll replace them, then they assume they shouldn't have broken.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, the, the, you know, those little arms are supposed to twist almost any  way|sd
A|and|%
B|Any direction.|^2
A|she's not that strong, that I  would  she's not that big of a girl that I think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|The main thing that they've, they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|You know, that was about it.|sd
A|That was about it.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff|sv
A|but,|%
B|And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics.|sd
B|My, my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight.|sd
A|Oh, is that right?|bh
B|Uh-huh|ny
B|and,|%
A|Well,  do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|not really.|sd
B|We, uh, haven't had that much, you know, problem with things that we have bought.|sd
B|They seem to, to last.|sd
B|In fact, when they offer us extended warranties, we, we don't buy them  because we've,|sd
A|Don't  buy them because you don't need them.|^2
A|Yes.|b
B|And, uh, it seems like it's just a, an added tack on.|sv
B|Plus a lot of the credit cards now, you know, will guarantee,|sv
B|if you purchase on your credit card  you know,  then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time,|sv
A|Oh, yeah.  .|b
B|so it  seems  like it's a waste of money.|sv
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it, it's usually before that warranty would expire|sv
A|any,|%
A|the first one.|%
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|And like I've even bought, on a recliner once I bought, you know, a, a, an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that,|sd
B|and I never used it.|sd
A|You never even needed it.|b
B|And so it seems ridiculous.|sv
B|And like washers and dryers and things like that, I've never had one go out.|sd
B|In fact, they usually,|%
B|when they do go out, it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix|sd
B|and we don't even have a repairman come,|sd
B|or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace  the whole thing.|sd
A|It's time to  replace it.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|So, I  mean,|%
A|I  think these extended warranties are gimmicks, really.|sv
B|I do too.|aa
A|A lot of it.|sv
A|We bought, when we first married, we bought one on our T V|sd
A|and that there's,|%
A|it was a five year, after the first five years,|sd
A|and it was ridiculous.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they charge you a pretty good price for them  too.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|They're a pretty healthy price,|sv
A|and you're trying to think oh, maybe I'll need this.|sv
A|You never, you always think gosh, if I say no, then I won't, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But,|%
B|Well,  my husband  finally just put his foot down|sd
A|I don't know.|h
B|and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore,|sd
B|and if it goes out, well  you know.|sd
A|You  probably  got your worth out of it anyway.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|and, uh, so we really have been fairly happy with things,|sd
B|but now we take good care of things|sd
B|and we don't, uh, run out and buy a lot of, of things either.|sd
B|And since our kids aren't little anymore, I'm not buying a lot of those little things  that can get broken.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|the little,|%
