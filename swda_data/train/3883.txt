A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So how do you just figure ,|qw
B|Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,|sd
B|today was a beautiful day|sd
B|it was like, uh, uh, summer day.|sd
B|It was seventy degrees|sd
B|so so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews|sd
B|and so I had to dress up anyway|sd
B|and then I wore heels, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots you know.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So how do you dress?|qw
A|Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I  was working at now.|oo_co_cc
B|Okay.|aa
A|Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it|sd
A|and I wore heels anyway|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And,|%
B|I,  I can see,|sd
B|I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter|sd
B|and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,  it was tiring.|sd
A|I know,|aa
A|it might kill you to go up and  walk up to  the door|bf
B|That's right.|aa
A|but you're going to look nice for the kids|bf
B|That's right|aa
B|and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?|qy
A|Oh, oh, yeah.|aa
A|Well, I need all the height I can get|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I do too.|sd
B|So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades,  uh, older grades, I had  to wear heels.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we too. Um,|sd
A|if it was it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots|sd
A|but then I would change, um, into heels,  as soon as I got  to my desk.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, um,|%
B|Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know,|sd
B|it has a heel on it.|sd
B|They're the kind of boots that I wear to work|sd
B|and we wear them, you know,|sd
B|they're a leather boot that you wear|sd
B|and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.|sd
B|Uh, it's kind of a,|sd
B|I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots.|sd
B|They're not a cowboy boot,|sd
B|but they're just a real pretty boot,|sd
B|but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Huh. Well, um,|%
B|Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.|sv
A|Yeah, um,|aa
A|the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it|sd
A|So I did,|sd
B|Oh, my goodness|ba
B|so then you had to.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and then the third year we, um, got heating|sd
A|so it was nice|sd
B|Yes.|aa
B|Then things improved, right?|qy
A|Right,|na
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot  you know, you know,|sd
A|Oh, that's  nice.|ba
B|and, uh, that's very seldom|sd
B|we, it depends upon our winter.|sd
B|We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know,|sd
B|but most of the time you can wear a sweater|sd
B|and we just don't wear coats much.|sd
B|We often laugh about even when it turns chilly.|sd
B|We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh. Nice.|ba
A|Well|%
B|It's really different.|sd
B|Let's put it that way.|h
B|Are you not teaching anymore?|qy
A|Uh, no,|nn
A|we, we moved to Iowa|sd
A|and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.|sd
B|Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I wear, uh, tennis shoes,  and  jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|More practical.|^2
A|not,|%
A|yes,|aa
A|it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.|sd
B|When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual|sd
B|Yeah, well,|b
A|For,|%
B|I know that  some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,|sd
B|and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|really.|aa
B|It's all right for the students,|sv
B|they look tacky a lot|sv
B|but I didn't think teachers should, you know.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's how I feel too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?|qy
A|Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it|arp_nd
A|but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,|sd
B|Where did you live before?|qw
A|Um, we lived in Utah before|sd
A|and, and I grew up in California.|sd
B|Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,|bf
