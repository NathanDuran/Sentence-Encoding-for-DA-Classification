A|Well, actually, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas|sd
A|I don't think I agree with,|sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|No.|nn
B|You don't believe in it?|qy^d
A|Uh, I wouldn't say that.|no
A|I think I would have said that a few years ago.|sd
A|When I was younger I thought it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment|sd
A|but, um, uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.|sd
A|I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment|sd
A|but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought|sd
B|You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She has very, very black and white opinions, you know.|sd
B|There's no gray in her opinions, you know.|sd
B|She, she probably would agree more with you|sd
B|but, but I don't know.|h
B|I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again.|sv
B|I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we see that more and more.|sv
B|Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you know, that's fourteen years old.|sd
B|What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult.|qh
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,|sv
A|but, uh,|%
B|No|aa
B|it doesn't|sv
B|but, it costs less.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|That, that's  a factor.|sv
B|And,  yeah,|b
B|to me it is.|sd
B|I mean, I work and I pay my taxes|sd
B|and I lived out in Texas for a little while|sd
B|and they're|%
B|and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia|sd
B|I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.|sd
B|If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much  anymore.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I,|%
A|the cost is something|sv
A|but it's, but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, dealing with crime|sv
A|and I guess I would like,|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment|sd
A|and they  they don't have a crime problem either.|sv
B|Oh, really.|b
A|No,|%
A|you can't,|%
A|they don't execute anybody in Britain or France|sd
A|and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either|sd
A|and they don't have the crime problems we do.|sv
A|I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing|sd
A|and the,  that, that bothers me.|sd
B|You might be right.|ba
A|But it,|%
A|but, uh,|%
B|I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know,|sd
B|I would never in a million years want that job|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|but I do believe it's necessary|sv
B|and I,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and I couldn't pull the switch|sd
B|but,  uh,|%
A|Well actually  I,|%
A|the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.|sd
A|I think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians|sv
A|so|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed,  uh, uh,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.|sd
A|I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment  and  nor the other way around.|sd
B|What  what's making you become more convinced that it might be a  good way of punishing|qw
A|Uh, I guess  I'm, I'm,|%
A|my view of uh,|%
A|my,|%
A|I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else|sv
A|and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered|sd
A|and, uh  I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.|sd
B|Oh, gosh|ba
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|if it ever touched my|sd
