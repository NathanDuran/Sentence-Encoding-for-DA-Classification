A|I don't know if you feel the same|qy^d
A|but, uh, when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen|sv
A|or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.|sv
B|Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to, uh, mandatory.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Exactly.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
B|A,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|I kind of agree with that.|aa
B|Uh, I don't think,|%
B|you know, it, they should have, they should have the same rights as anyone else you know.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right|b
B|It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess, like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.|sv
B|Uh, or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh, people be more eager to do it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Exactly.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And doing it for a purpose that they want.|sv
A|The other thing is this,|sv
A|I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems|sv
A|but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.|sv
A|Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.|sv
A|You have to do so much as  far as in  community service now.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|If they were, you know, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever|sv
A|but I could see that working in you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's, I think they have done that|sd
A|and judges have said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for a, you know, a misdemeanor or something,|sd
A|you may end up having to do some kind of community service|^q
A|so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,|sv
A|so|%
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Uh, that's a good idea.|ba
B|Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or in trouble anyway.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure.|aa
A|We sure  do.|aa
B|So  they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And  I, I agree wholeheartedly.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b^m
B|But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.|qh
B|And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would rehabilitate    rehabilitate  rehabilitate them|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Exactly.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then when they get out, they,|sv
B|because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.|sv
A|And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment|sv
A|and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.|sv
A|I would say the crimes would probably be, you know,|sv
A|if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have,|sv
A|so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on|sv
A|and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two|sv
A|but I didn't get any rehabilitation|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or, uh, you know. But then again, those that have physically assaulted somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program  out in  the community if they're of a violent sort and to say|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
