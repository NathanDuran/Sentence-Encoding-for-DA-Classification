A|It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and, and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful|sd
A|and we did end up with, uh, I B M, P C which I now would not have chosen|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|But that was before the Macintosh.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And twenty years ago I was, uh, in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter|sd
B|Oh, I know it.|aa
A|So I would say that's one of the largest changes in, at least in my life.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I've seen that just in the last, uh, even five years how much they've uh, increased in use. Or probably eight years,|sd
B|when I was a freshman in college uh, my degree was in computer, uh, technology originally|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it seemed like it would,|%
B|they were just getting out with the, you know, the disks and all that, getting away with the cards,  you  know, doing away with the, the programming cards|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|bk
B|and, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|thirty years ago I, I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer|sd
A|and we had to write code in binary|sd
A|and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which,  I don't  think exists anymore.|sd
B|I know.|aa
B|No.|aa
A|You never see one of those punch cards anymore.|sd
B|Uh, I think T V has a lot to do with the changes, too. Don't you? In, like, people's attitudes.|sv
A|Well, very possibly.|aap_am
A|Uh, I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before.|sv
A|Uh, certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes. Even, even the change from black and white to color television.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Thirty years ago I guess there were color T V|sd
A|but I sure didn't have access to one.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, but, twenty years ago, practically everybody had a color T V,|sd
A|and now I think they're as, almost as many, well,|%
A|there are more T V than households,|sd
A|so it's close to getting, uh, one T V per person they say|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|And now everybody, uh, has V C R and two or three V C R and that kind of thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Certainly ten years ago, uh, V C R were just coming on the market|sd
A|so that's made a significant difference in the way I watch television for instance,|sv
A|because, uh, now I almost never watch a T V program when it's on.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I know.|aa
A|I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient|sd
A|and that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted.|sd
A|I can just put it on pause|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and you can, you can flip through the commercials|sd
B|so you don't have to watch the commercials.|sd
A|Right.|aa
B|That's always convenient.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes,|aa
A|you can watch a program in forty-five minutes instead of an hour|sd
A|You skip the commercials.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|So, what was our question about, decline in|qw
A|Wasn't the decline so much.|arp_nd
A|I think they just said the changes in, uh, social, social changes in the United States.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|How was life different ten, twenty, or thirty years ago.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Well, I can't really remember back that far,|sd
B|but ten years ago, uh, I don't know. I'd say, like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with A M, what do you call those, little A M radios|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and now people have jam box with C D players in them, you know.  And,  hand held T V and car phones.|sd
A|Yes.|aa
A|That's certainly,  a  difference.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's another one,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|car phones is a good point, and, uh, cellular phones of all types and beepers.|sv
A|Uh,  ten  years ago I was working in a job at a medical center|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I had to carry a beeper around|sd
A|and they were kind of bulky|sd
A|and all they did was just, uh, make a beep noise|sd
A|and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|These days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils|sd
A|and they fit in your shirt pocket|sd
A|and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a, a phone number to respond to|sd
A|and,|%
B|Those are cool.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|those are pretty neat.|aa
A|And they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off,  in  a theatre or something|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you can still get your messages|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, let's see, social changes, uh, uh,|^h
B|Where do you think it's, where do you think it's going to go in twenty years?|qw
A|I haven't the slightest idea.|sd
A|I was just thinking, though, about a, a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago.|sd
A|I, I know that because I was writing a paper about it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I was writing a, a journal article.|sd
A|Uh, and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything.|sd
A|And, uh, there was a suspicion,  that  it was a virus|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|but nobody had identified it|sd
A|and they were really just going on epidemiological, uh,  uh,  guesswork, uh, because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like, uh, hepatitis|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then,  from,  from the spread pattern of hepatitis, they could work backwards to the transmission by, uh, blood and semen.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then I,|%
B|I'm curious what was your, uh, graduate study in?|qw
A|Well, I, I was in English as a matter of fact, and medieval studies,|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh,  but I went to work as an editor and writer,|sd
A|so, uh, uh, the, ten years ago I was working in the medical center, uh, publishing a journal and writing about medical topics|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, let's see, twenty years ago, I guess we 're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the, uh, the sex revolution where, uh after the pill|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, uh, freed people up from worries about, uh, illegitimate pregnancy|sd
A|and, I guess in the seventies is the, the time when that was supposed to have exploded.|sd
A|Thirty years ago there was no pill.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|You think that's caused a lot of pressure on, like younger kids today,  to  make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|I do.|sd
A|I really do.|sd
A|I have, uh,  four  kids in college right now, children and stepchildren|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I know that the expectation for them was, uh, to have sex and, much earlier,  than  the expectation when I was in college.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|In my day, we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be,  sleeping  with their boyfriends|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, they certainly didn't expect everybody to|sd
A|and it was really only, uh, acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in, in the relatively near future.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It's kind of scary when I think of what will happen in twenty years, you know, when I have kids and they're grown and uh, just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more|sd
B|so.|%
A|And I guess the answer,  is, is, stay flexible because nobody can  predict what's going to happen in twenty years|sv
B|Seems like it can't get much worse.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what, uh, my kids were likely to be like.|sd
A|Course, one of them was just a, a, a brand new baby twenty years ago,|sd
A|so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|b
A|And some of the other ones weren't born.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|So, sounds like America's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and worldwide communication|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|Electronic mail.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just got on that this past, about a year ago|sd
A|and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things. Even when they're on another continent.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It's pretty wild.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Even, you know,|%
A|that reminds me, Federal Express was around ten years ago,|sd
A|but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and nowadays people use Fed Ex, all the time.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Sure do. Huh.|aa
A|People do seem to travel more.|sv
A|It's much more common for people, even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and,  Asia.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I was almost thirty before I got off this continent.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|I know that's what, uh, what my family was talking when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana|sd
B|and they were like, well, you know, thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, especially come home every couple months.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and,|%
