A|And I have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that I hadn't voted in an election yet,|sd
A|and although I did go down and register and I,|sd
A|that's the first time I've ever done that.|sd
A|Has, what's been your voting experience?|qo
B|My voting experience?|br
A|Well, do you feel like, uh,|qy
A|I mean, I,|%
B|I, I, well, personally I've been very diligent until recent years. When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|For the issues that, you know, that I felt really strong for, uh, I think apathy has set in to a lot of  people  because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's really true.|aa
A|That's kind of the way I have felt.|sv
A|I, I also feel guilty, uh, not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates.|sd
A|Course, we only have mostly the representation given in the media,|sv
A|but, uh, I have felt since I've been here that I haven't known what the issues were and that I, because it was a new community.|sd
B|You really do have to study to get yourself, uh, up to par with what is truly going on|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that takes a lot of research|sv
B|and  and people today are very busy|sv
A|It does.|aa
B|and uh, and that is an excuse because we are, we are always, uh,|sv
A|Yes.|b
B|I know I'm heavily involved in other things|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and to take time out and, uh, study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't have the time to devote to that|sd
A|No.|b
B|and, uh, you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And unfortunately they are not.|sv
A|No.|b
B|And, uh, it's really a dilemma, uh, that we find ourselves in, I believe. Uh,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|So I kind of just have taken a back step away and, uh, hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Take it,|%
B|because it is a task that is, to me, kind of overwhelming.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|and, uh, and, uh, I also feel, especially in the presidential elections that, uh, since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and, or that, and that you don't necessarily, your vote doesn't necessarily elect president.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes.|sv
A|Right|b
A|and it's kind of,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|it's awful,|sv
A|and, and it's hard to feel like one person,|sv
A|but I know that it's important,|sv
A|and I feel guilty that I haven't done that here, haven't taken the time|sd
A|and I know that, you know, people can make a difference,|sv
A|but it's hard to, to face the corruption, like you say, and, uh, and to know what you're up against.|sv
A|And it makes me feel bad that,|sd
A|I'm glad,|%
A|I mean, I am thankful for the, uh,|sd
A|nineteenth amendment is it that gives women the right to vote|sd
A|and, uh, I'm glad that that happened and everything|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|and I hope that I will become a better, make a better difference in,|sd
A|but I haven't done that so far.|sd
B|Well, I know that when you're in a smaller community,|sv
B|I live in Mesquite|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, when we have, uh, a local election, say for our mayor and so forth they really, uh, give a lot of information in the local newspaper, not in the, not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, they, they just give it a small portion of the newspaper,|sd
B|but the local newspaper really goes into, uh, quite a bit of history about the candidate|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, and then they have, they raise a, they raise two sides|sd
B|and, uh, there's a pro and a con side|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, you can really, uh, feel comfortable in, uh, evaluating that, uh, candidate by, uh, that method.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth.|sd
B|Now, I wouldn't say that about the larger cities though, and the, and the country on, like, the presidential.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I mean, they've got people that are running that are admitted, uh, criminals and admitted crooks.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|You know, I'm sorry,|fa
B|but I don't believe in them turning a good, uh, uh, a new leaf unless they have the Lord that has done that to them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, without the Lord, they can't do it.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|and it's not very likely.|sv
A|I mean, it seems like|%
