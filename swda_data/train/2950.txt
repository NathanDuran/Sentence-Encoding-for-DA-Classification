A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|You want to get a start?|ad
B|Certainly.|aa
B|Uh, the weather here is warm.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it has been sort of raining on and off.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I am an avid gardener|sd
B|so I measure the rain in our rain gauge on a, on a regular basis.|sd
B|So I can, can avoid wasting money on watering.|sd
A|Oh, great,|ba
A|great.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,|sd
B|and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment.|sd
B|But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|How about|qo
A|I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?|qy
A|Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours.|qy^d
B|It starts in, uh, March as a rule.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|See that is quite a bit,|sv
A|we are just beginning.|sd
A|People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now.|sd
A|We could still have a frost.|sd
B|Really,|bh
B|this late?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Could you have snow?|qy
A|Uh, probably not.|nn
A|But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June.|sd
B|Oh, well, we do not have that problem|sd
A|Early June.|sd
A|So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring.|sd
A|It is almost like an early Summer for us.|sd
B|Oh, that is nice.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|We could use a little more rain, I believe.|sd
B|Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours|sd
A|Uh|b
B|Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then it stops for three months.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|If it could just be spread out a little bit.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|It has really been nice here, uh,|sd
A|we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,|sd
A|but I don't know if we'll get it or not.|sd
A|A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.|sd
A|The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Are you in an agricultural area?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|We have,|%
B|Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|We have quite a few farmers.|sd
A|We, we live out in the country.|sd
A|We are on a farm,|sd
A|but we are not a farming person|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, we have a garden.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, but we are not farmers.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|They get burnt off.|sv
B|They, they really do,|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium.|sv
A|I know our aunt in California,|sd
A|they, they have really been rationed on their water.|sd
A|And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms.|sv
A|Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Well, my parents are now in San Diego,|sd
B|and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, they are not allowed to water,|sd
A|so what do you do?|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them|sd
B|so,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas.|sd
B|Because the, the Summers are extremely hot.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But your humidity is different though than ours I think,|sd
A|and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too.|sv
B|Um, what is your humidity like?|qw
A|Oh, I don't know.|no
A|I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.|sd
A|I could be wrong.|sd
B|Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise|sd
B|but I,|%
A|I do not know for sure either.|sd
A|But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas.|sd
A|It had a different feel to it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south.|sd
A|Uh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it is not dry.|sd
B|And, and I have lived here for many years,|sd
B|and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.|sd
B|Where the water is coming from, I don't know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, it could be.|sv
A|I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,|sd
B|Oh, does he live near the lake?|qy
A|Well, there is a lake not far|arp_nd
A|but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh.|b
A|And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times.|sd
B|That is, that is a problem, uh,|ba
B|they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Because of that.|^2
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I know exactly what you mean.|sd
A|We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that.|sd
B|Oh, well, that is fortunate.|ba
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It is an old farm house|sd
A|and, uh, we really like it here.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I, I like it, I like it here.|sd
B|Uh, I, I grew up here.|sd
B|I have lived other places|sd
B|and, and, but I, I did grow up here|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and this is very much home for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And,|%
A|It is nice down there.|sv
A|I, I, I liked it when we visited there.|sd
B|I hope you visited during the winter.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter|sv
B|and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|That is the best time to go.|aa
A|Yeah.|%
A|and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice.|sd
A|It has been hot,|sd
A|but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there.|sd
B|Oh, sure.|b
B|I mean|%
A|You know|qh
A|But it is nice,|sv
A|it is a, it is really a nice area.|sv
B|I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,|sd
B|and we could not get her out of the what she called the English back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
A|Oh.|b
B|And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn|sd
A|Oh, good heavens|ba
A|Not me|sd
A|I avoid the sun|sd
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|basically I do, too.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass.|sd
A|And I try to cover up when I do the lawn|sd
B|Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, I have had a little, a couple of problems|sd
A|and, uh, I decided it is not worth it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That,|%
A|I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier.|sv
A|And, uh, we are just crazy|sv
B|But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot.|sv
B|Now my sister is a, a sun fiend.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, she is five years younger than me,|sd
B|she is more wrinkled.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
A|It, it just makes your skin more leathery.|sv
B|and I think that is why.|sv
A|It, uh, it,|%
B|Exactly.|aa
A|yeah.|%
A|So,|%
B|I think it burns off the,|sv
B|I don't know the, the, the theory, the scientific principle.|sd
B|But it burns something off, the natural oils or something like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it.|sd
A|They say it destroys a lot of that.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|And you lose a lot of that.|sd
A|So, uh,|%
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|but, uh, but we have really had nice,|sd
A|the weather,|sd
A|I can't complain.|sd
A|We have really had really good weather of late.|sd
B|Good.|ba
A|And when it has rained, it it's been a good soaking rain|sd
A|and, uh, it has just been a really nice Spring.|sd
B|Well, that is great.|ba
B|It has been, it has been very nice here too.|sd
B|And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening|sd
B|and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Oh, that is great.|ba
A|How long will they be there?|qw
B|Uh, probably four or five days.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that is great.|ba
A|Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, uh, that you have a good visit and everything.|sd
B|Well, thank you|ft
B|Thanks.|ft

B|I am sure I will.|fc
B|In, in fact, if I had not been preparing for this, the out of town visitors, I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days.|fc
A|Yeah,|fc
A|I forget to.|fc
A|The day goes by,|fc
A|and I forget to make a call usually.|fc
B|Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will, I will start doing it|fc
