A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|now the term personal computer, uh,|%
A|I don't happen to have one at home. Um,|sd
A|but I do have a personal computer on my desk here.|sd
B|A type of work station?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|uh, yeah,|ny
A|just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process.|sd
A|And, uh, it, it works just fine.|sd
A|It says it's a monochrome monitor, Panasonic printer, uh, no big deal,|sd
A|it, it does the things I need for it to do.|sd
B|Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it's not even that.|sd
B|It's eighty eighty-eight?|qy
A|Uh, I think that's about where it is.|na
B|Okay.|bk
B|Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it?|qw
B|Word processing obviously.|sd
A|Uh, yeah,|aa
A|I do that,|sd
A|I, I do, uh, some Lotus on it. Uh, do some, uh, Samna, some, uh, P F M, uh, nothing extremely complex.|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Uh, I use them both here at work and at home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I have I B M clones in both cases.|sd
A|Yep.|b
B|Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I bet that's a pretty nice setup.|ba
B|Yes,|aa
B|it is.|sd
B|Uh, unfortunately I need all of it.|sd
A|Yep.|b
B|Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And that, I know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it|sd
B|and he had a two eighty-six machine,|sd
A|Yep.|b
B|and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And then I have, uh, a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm really pleased with it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.|sd
A|Sure.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them.|sd
B|Have you,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|To try to make them more effective and useful.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?|qy
A|Well, um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software.|no
A|When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M,|sd
A|and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect.|sd
A|So, I can never quite stay current with that.|sd
B|Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it.|sv
B|It's, uh,|%
B|I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it.|sd
B|It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The,|%
B|at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Huh.|b
A|I can I can believe that.|ba
B|Very frustrating.|sd
B|Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise.|sd
B|Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two.|sd
B|You come here with the B level of specs?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|not really.|sd
A|I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.|sd
B|Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Okay.|bk
A|Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.|sv
B|Well, I sure need them.|aap_am
B|Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them.|sd
A|I can believe that.|ba
A|Well, it's, it's been interesting.|sv
B|Yes, uh,|aa
B|maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things.|sv
B|I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have.|sv
B|When you start seeing what all they can do for you.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.|sv
B|Well, I understand that you know.|ba
B|if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home|sd
A|I|%
A|is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?|qy
B|Right.|na
A|That, that must be a fairly recent release.|bf
B|Uh, that's,|%
B|came out around the first of the year.|aap_am
A|Okay,|bk
A|okay.|bk
A|Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes,|sd
A|but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.|sd
B|It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know,|sd
B|once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.|sv
A|Sure.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I enjoyed our discussion.|sd
A|I did too,|aa
A|and you have a good day.|fc
B|You do the same.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
