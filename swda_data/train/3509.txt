A|So, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
B|Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment  penalties.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|you don't think,|%
B|Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I mean, there is things that|%
B|seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do.|sv
B|Now, you know, I mean somebody, a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,|sv
B|you kind of,|%
B|I don't know.|h
B|What about yourself?|qo
A|I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh,|sd
A|it's, you know, it seems right sometimes|sv
A|and then other times, you don't know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh,|b
B|I mean, people, like,|%
B|I,|%
B|it's been,|%
B|I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having effective, effective punishments|sv
B|and, and they're extremely severe.|sv
B|Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because you never know if it's going to be applied. Right,|sv
B|unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand|sv
B|and  and you walk around  the rest of your life with one hand|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and everybody knows exactly what, what for.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh,  and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,|sv
B|or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,|sv
A|I mean, sure, their life is taken,|sv
A|but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,|sv
A|so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with|sv
A|so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the for the you know, what they've done.|sv
B|some people,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,|sv
B|it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. To keep people in jail.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,|sd
A|so uh, it's,|%
B|Uh-huh|b
A|it doesn't,|%
A|it seems by, that by,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|doesn't ever really, uh ...|%
B|Oh, I know,|aa
B|I mean, you can't,|%
B|it doesn't,  Taking  , taking one more life doesn't, doesn't, doesn't  get things back the way they were, right.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|It doesn't bring back every,|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't know, I, I don't, I really don't know, uh,|h
A|What state are you in?|qw
B|I'm in Texas.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
A|In Dallas?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I'm in Austin.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Where, where are you calling from?|qw
A|Uh, right now I'm in Utah,|sd
A|but I'm from Plano, Texas.|sd
B|Oh, I see,|bk
B|uh-huh.|%
A|So, uh, uh, what are the laws like in Texas?|qw
B|It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the well,|%
B|I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment.|sd
B|Uh, Texas has had it for a while.|sd
B|It's one of the quickest,|sd
B|it, it,|%
B|once it was, it was reallowed,|sd
B|I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution|sd
B|and it seems like everybody stopped|sd
B|and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|They do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I'm originally from Kansas|sd
B|and in Kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment|sd
B|and, uh, there they do it by hanging.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Still, uh, they have,|%
B|I still remember the, the, the movie, uh, IN COLD BLOOD.|sd
B|I don't know if you've ever,|qy^d
B|I'm sure you're familiar with it,|qy^d
B|but, have you seen the movie?|qy
A|I haven't,|ng
A|no.|nn
B|Yeah.|b
B|That way.|sd
A|And they do it that way?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|well, they, they show it,|sd
B|not, not,|%
B|I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,|sd
B|but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows.|sd
B|It's kind of a barn like structure.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|I think they're there,|sd
A|I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in in Utah also.|sd
A|I'm not really familiar.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
B|Are you there in school?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I am.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, but I think they|%
A|a long time ago, I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns|sd
A|and one of them has the real gun in it.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|has, has a,|%
B|yeah.|%
A|So they don't know who killed,|sd
B|Has a real bullets|qy^d
B|and the rest of them have blanks?|qy^d
A|Right.|na
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,|sd
B|I know that|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|no.|aa
B|I've always said that if I, if I had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, I guess.|sv
