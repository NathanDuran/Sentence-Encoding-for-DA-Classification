A|so we all had to take lessons,|sd
A|and I was the one that did the least poorly,|sd
A|so she gave it to me.|sd
A|And it's sitting here mostly taking up space,|sd
A|but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it.|sd
A|It is real relaxing.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|it must be fun to be able to play it|sv
B|and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|because I mean, I play the flute|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.|sd
B|Isn't that nice.|bh
B|I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting,|sv
B|but, it, it's mostly relaxing|sv
B|and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean|sv
B|or, but, uh,|%
A|I mean you can just sit,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|My, my little boy has gotten so into it that|sd

A|then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, I see what you're saying.|bk
A|Huh?|br
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, I don't even know who did which ones,|sd
A|but he does.|sd
B|I, I can't identify them either.|sd
B|I just like them.|sd
B|I could, I know which ones come next,|sd
B|but I don't even know their names.|sd
B|Most of them I don't know their names of the song,|sd
B|but I, I can identify them.|sd
B|But I like that|%
B|and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh,|%
A|Were you in the band?|qy
B|I was in the band,|na

B|so. I I can relate to it, I suppose|sd
B|But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too,|sd
B|because I like Chicago|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh,|^h

B|Oh,|%
B|but we do have,|%
B|I like Simply Red,|sd
B|we got Simply Red.|sd
B|I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like|sd
B|And, uh, I like Breeze,|sd
B|I like the group.|sd
B|I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh.|sd
A|So what type, Simply Red,|qw
A|I've never heard of that.|sd
A|Is it just instrumental?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|it's, it's got people singing,|sd
B|but it's it is instrumental.|sd
B|But it's, it's got people singing|sd
B|but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the|t3
B|he can't hear me.|sd
B|I, I don't remember how many people,|sd
B|but, it's, it's got men and women|sd
B|and it's not, it's, it's nice,|sd
B|I mean it's pleasant, you know, music.|sd
B|It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it.|sd
B|But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it.|sd
B|You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road|sd
A|We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend.|sd
A|And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.|sd
B|Oh, you must live in this area.|sv
A|Yeah,|ny
A|where are you?|qw
B|We're in Sherman.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|So we're in Garland.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|You're going to Commerce?|qy^d
A|Yeah|ny
B|For East Texas or something?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Just because there's a friend up there,|sd
A|not because there's much else|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas.|sd
B|That's why I was just|%
A|For colleges?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester|sd
A|Well, they're not|%
B|and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.|sd
A|They're not going to recruit me anymore,|sd
A|I'm through.|sd
A|No more for me.|sd
B|No more, huh.|b^m
A|What, what do you do?|qw
B|Well, right now I'm just a homemaker,|sd
B|but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant|sd
B|and that's what I know,|sd
B|so, and, uh, just nothing basically|sd
A|Are you going to go to East Texas for that?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|it,|%
B|no|nn
B|I don't go to East Texas.|sd
B|I got a degree from T W U,|sd
B|but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment,|sd
B|but I don't want to be a lawyer|sd
B|so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant.|sd
A|That'd probably be pretty interesting.|bf
A|I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week.|sd
A|They had summonsed eight hundred people,|sd
A|about four hundred showed up,|sd
A|and it was for a murder trial.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose|sd
A|Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they had us fill out a long questionnaire.|sd
A|We stayed till about one thirty|sd
A|and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time|sd
A|and the trial won't take place until June.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's how it works.|sd
A|And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks.|sd
A|And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed.|sd
A|I was an investigator|sd
A|and I was tailing the woman that was killed.|sd
A|Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer|sd
A|and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband|sd
A|and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it.|sd
A|And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it,|sd
A|and he had skipped bail|sd
A|and they finally extradited him|sd
A|and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.|sd
B|And this is the man that was in front of you?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh, well they'll, weed him out.|sd
A|The, the investigator.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|he, he got off right away.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I figure that that will make me biased|sd
A|and I won't be chosen.|sd
B|Well, not necessarily|arp_nd
A|Hopefully|sd
B|but there's probably something else that might make you.|sd
B|Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury.|sd
A|Yeah. No. *aa|b
B|I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it|sd
B|but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way.|sd
B|You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all.|sd
B|So but,|%
A|I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,|sd
A|You know.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not|sd
B|you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment.|sd
B|So,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|But then when you're, when you're picked,|%
A|see I was picked for another murder trial before|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done,|sd
A|and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you|sd
A|and you've got to come up with a decision.|sd
B|Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.|sd
B|You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt|sd
B|and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,|qh
