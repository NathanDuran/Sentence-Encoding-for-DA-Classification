A|Well, Stephanie, what's your position on gun control?|qo
B|Well, on a scale of one to ten, uh, being ten, no, kind of legislation and zero being, uh, total ban, I probably would lean more towards six or seven.|sd
B|Um, I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I lived in Massachusetts for two years|sd
B|and they have a total ban on guns|sd
B|and I saw that, it didn't stop crime in that state.|sd
A|Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles?|qy
B|Any, any kind of firearms.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Uh, it's,|%
B|there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught, um, with a firearm|sd
B|and also I think there was a fine.|sd
A|And that didn't help at all?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I don't,|%
B|the, the crime is not any better or any worse,|sd
B|I mean it's,|%
A|Huh.|b
B|I, I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse,|sd
B|but it certainly didn't get any better.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I usually just,|%
A|I'm trying to think of,|sd
A|I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the, the, like three, where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns any, by any means,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature, uh,|sv
A|you know, you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and, you  know, right off the shelf.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I,  I, I agree with that.|sd
A|And but,|%
B|I, I think that  the, the law is on who can buy a gun are, are way too lax.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|exactly.|aa
B|I think that,  I think that the,|%
A|And, so, I think  that kind of control is, would be good,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but the, uh,|%
A|I, you know, I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and, just to kind of exam it a little bit|sd
A|and I, I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true, uh,|sv
A|only the guns were in the hands of the criminals,|sv
A|but how many times,|%
A|I guess I have never heard of a, a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun.|sv
B|Um, I,|%
A|And maybe they just don't report those|sv
A|or I'm not sure|h
A|or, you know, I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed|sv
A|but good thing they had their gun on them|sv
A|and they, they thwarted the robbery attempt.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I'm, I'm not really sure,|h
B|I don't, personally I don't own a gun,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um, and I don't think I probably ever would, um, although I would like to know how to handle one,|sd
B|and I think it's good that and I think everybody should learn how to handle one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, you just never know when you might come into contact with one.|sd
A|True.|ba
B|Um,|%
A|Did, did you, were you brought up in a family that hunted|qy^d
A|or,|%
B|No.|nn
B|Uh, nobody in my family hunted,|sd
B|uh, my father had, had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts|sd
B|We lived in New Hampshire at the time.|sd
A|How about that.|ba
B|And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|so we ended up, uh, with these guns,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my, really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right|sd
B|and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere.|sd
A|Oh, jeez.|ba
B|And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns|sd
B|and it, it kind of scared me.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I think that if I learn how to use one, I would, I would feel better.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I've also always thought about the idea, you know, most sports, you know, which are the N R A and people have their thing, you know,|sd
A|if you ban guns, you're just banning the, the recreation, the sport of hunting, things of that nature.|sd
A|Most of that's done with rifles and such. Uh, though there's, you know, probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns.|sd
A|But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns, would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous,|sd
A|you couldn't be inconspicuous, when you walked into a store stuff like that,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately, you know,|sd
A|if they had to have a rifle or was,|sd
A|you know, made it more difficult to get a, a, uh, a handgun.|sd
A|Now of course, you know, in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|ba
A|But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and, you know, temporarily a little bit, uh, offset or off keel,|sd
A|I don't know if that's a large percentage of, uh, crime or not|h
A|but I guess it would be some.|sd
A|But I, I think definitely,|sv
A|like today they just introduced the, what's called the Brady bill. The seven day mandatory waiting period, on getting any guns.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I think that,  Shoot that's a good idea.|sv
B|I would definitely  support that.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I, I, I agree the thing that scares me, uh, though about where I would, I would definitely want some sort of legislation|sd
B|and coming from the north east, I'm just not used to seeing, um, these,|sd
B|and I, I know this may sound kind of stereo typical|sd
B|but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks. That's kind of scary to me|sd
A|Oh, sure.|ba
B|that kind of, to me it is more like vigilantism .|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on, in L A, on the freeways,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's crazy  .|ba
B|and then you  come here in, in the Dallas area, um,|sd
B|I don't, I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles. Um, especially not in the back window, for everybody to see.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's kind of, kind of wild.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That is kind of wild.|ba
A|Well, that's all very interesting|sv
A|Well, thanks for talking.|fc
B|Sure you're welcome.|fc
A|Good-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fc
B|bye-bye.|fc
