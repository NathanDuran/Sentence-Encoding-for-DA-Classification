A|Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't|sd
A|and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do.|sd
A|How about you?|qo
B|Well, I'm, uh, I, I was just, uh, in high school I guess when it, when it ended.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Ended up being,|%
B|I was in the last, last lottery.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I was glad it was over by then.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.|sd
B|Just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, we, uh,|%
B|those people that I know,|%
B|I work with several that were over there,|sd
B|and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday,|sd
B|I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods|sd
B|and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles|sd
B|and then they'd, come back|sd
B|and you know.|%
B|But that they weren't really allowed to do anything.|sd
B|I, uh,|%
B|to me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's funny.|sv
A|Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin.|sd
A|And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war|sd
A|and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh,|sv
A|I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, they're certainly all leaders|sv
A|and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it.|sv
A|Otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. That, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line|sv
A|Uh, I guess you can, I guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end.|sd
A|But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order to, uh, call the bully out and beat him.|sv
A|And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war.|sd
A|They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward.|sd
A|And, uh  we were wrong|sd
A|But I, uh, you know,|%
A|the, like I said, the more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable.|sd
A|But the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where,|sd
A|and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I, I, I think we did, I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for,|sv
B|I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war.|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Uh, I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war.  I mean  they seemed like a valiant thing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You knew, you knew who was good.|sd
B|You knew who was bad.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it was a, it was a traditional the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if  you, you know  whichever way it is.|sd
A|Well you're  not,|%
B|But in, in the Vietnam war it seems like it was,|%
B|a, a, the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad|sv
B|and and, uh, you know, the,|%
A|It's ambivalent,|sv
A|yeah.|aa
B|even,|%
B|it seems like even the people, you know,|%
B|had the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and, of course, the Laotians|%
B|and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved.|sd
B|But,|%
A|What, what about the domestic effects|qh
A|like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government.|sv
A|And they,|%
A|that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that tradition is still,|%
A|I mean it's dying now,|sd
A|but it's still alive as opposed to,|sd
A|this Desert Storm stuff may have,  uh  killed it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I think that was one of the biggest,|%
A|that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest,|%
