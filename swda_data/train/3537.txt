A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what do you think about, uh, the self insurance business?|qw
B|Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, uh, General, ex, uh, Surgeon General Koop.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he talked about Canada's system|sd
B|and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,|sv
B|but the expensive stuff, heart, uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.|sd
B|And they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in San Francisco.|sd
B|So in one city of, in America, there's as many, uh, hospitals that are equipped to do uh, heart operations as in the entire area of Canada,|sd
B|and that's kind of spooky.|sv
A|Well, I, uh, I understand what you're saying,|sd
A|and there's probably some truth to that.|sv
A|I think that, uh, generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities.|sv
A|However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession, it eventually leads to that,|sv
A|and I think the costs and the, uh, the way the medical profession has, every year|sd
A|I, being in my own business, uh,|sd
A|in the last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs,|sd
A|and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I think they're asking for it.|sv
A|I, I think the medical profession is just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|Do you  think that it's just, uh, medical guys?|qy
B|What about, you know, you know how expensive new equipment and technology is.|qw
B|That's where I think most of the cost is coming.|sv
A|Well, I, I think a lot of it is, uh,|sv
A|I, I don't disagree totally with that,|arp_nd
A|but, uh, my wife this last summer, uh, when we were on vacation tore up her knee,|sd
A|and, uh, uh, it was ligaments, uh, in her  knee,  as it turned out, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|she came back that, uh,|sd
A|we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened|sd
A|and, uh, she got home,|sd
A|and the leading orthopedic man, who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come,|sd
A|I mean, he knows knee problems  okay,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it.|sd
A|Well, she goes in,|sd
A|he says, well, I think this is what it is,|sd
A|but, uh, you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things.|^q
A|A thousand dollars for this, uh, oh, magnetic, uh, resonance imaging type thing.|sd
A|And my wife said, well, do I need that?|sd
A|And he says, well, uh, you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this.|sd
A|I mean, uh, you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing.|^q
A|Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital.|sd
A|Now, a,  thousand, uh, uh, dollars for thirty-five minutes.|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|I mean, doctors routinely send people in for anything.|sv
A|Now, for years they didn't have this|sd
A|and they solved these problems,|sv
A|and, you  know,|%
B|Yeah .|b
A|I said to her, well, look, you know, if you feel you got to go, go,|sd
A|but I, I think a thousand dollars,|sd
A|these guys,|%
A|I don't know what it is,|sd
A|but  there's,  no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day.|sv
B|Uh-huh .|b
A|And even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at, uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, uh, that's ridiculous.|sv
A|I, I don't care what anyone says.|sd
A|You know, the costs are not,|sv
A|it's a picture.|sd
A|It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that, you know, reasonableness.|sv
A|But they aren't reasonable.|sv
A|Fifty, a hundred dollars.|sd
A|They don't have to pay them back in three months time.|sd
B|No.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I'll have to  agree,  with you there,|sd
A|You know .|%
B|but there's another problem,|sv
B|and that's the, how litigious our society is.|sv
B|If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court.|sv
A|Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem,|sv
A|but that's part of our legalese problem.|sv
A|And that, the government eventually will address too just, you know, because it's out of control.|sv
A|I, I agree with you.|aa
A|You know, uh, I was on a jury|sd
A|or I, I didn't make the jury,|sd
A|but there was a, deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Like it was three days after it was born,|sd
A|and he was the one that delivered it.|sd
A|And they got four attorneys,|sd
A|one guy out of Houston, he introduced himself as snake so-and-so,|sd
A|and he says, well, anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars,|sd
A|and I says, yeah,|sd
A|I got problems with|^q
A|I mean, you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back, you know,|sd
A|I mean, as sorrowful as it is. Uh, you know, if the doctor is wrong, you know, he should be pulled from his license,|sv
A|but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, you know,|sd
A|it, it doesn't make logical sense to me,|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|No,|aa
B|it doesn't.|sv
A|Uh, that's,|%
