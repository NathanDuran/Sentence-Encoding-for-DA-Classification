B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh,|sd

A|so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football|sd
A|and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.|sd
A|So we're riding bicycles|sd
A|and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And uh, so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to change.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.|sd
A|I really enjoyed skiing. Uh, and a lot of outdoor activities.|sd
A|Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now,|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day|sd
A|but,|%
B|Oh yeah.|b
B|I have not had the opportunity to go skiing|sd
B|but, uh, I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it|sd
B|but uh, never did get out and ski|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|You didn't?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I never did.|sd
B|Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing|sd
B|and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places.|sd
B|I couldn't go by myself.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
B|And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.|sd
B|So|%
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|I guess that for me it was very helpful.|sd
A|My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.|sd
B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And so we, we went quite often|sd
A|and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.|sd
A|When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago|sd
A|and we would go skiing and enjoy that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have|sd
A|and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned|sd
A|and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|Oh yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer|sd
