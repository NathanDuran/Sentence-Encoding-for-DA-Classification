A|It's, it's just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story type home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and I think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are.|sd
A|Uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes|sd
A|and yet there's,|%
A|where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is,|sd

A|It's kind of like what ours is.|sd
A|Uh, one of our bedrooms is really small|sd
A|and we've made that into a den because we only have one child,|sd
A|so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller.|sd
