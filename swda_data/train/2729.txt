B|Really.|b
A|But he jumped in, in the, the river.|sd
B|Did puppy go to?|qy
A|Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,|sd
A|I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,|sd
B|Oh, that's good,|ba
B|yeah.|b
A|'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her.|sd
A|And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.|sd

B|She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|it wasn't like he didn't|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet,|sd
A|but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.|sd
