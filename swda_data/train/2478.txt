A|Are you Republican or Democrat?|qy
B|Uh, kind of neither.|sd
A|Okay,|bk
A|well, I'm a, I'm a Democrat|sd
A|so I was going to say if you're a Republican, boy we would really have a good time.|sd
B|I do have some Republican leanings, because, I am division one, you know|sd
A|Well, I, uh,|%
A|to answer that one before we get to our subject, you know, I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money|sd
A|and they're the ones wasting all the money.|sv
A|And, I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want, you know.|sd
A|I get a kick out of that.|sd
A|But, anyway, the subject, go ahead.|ad
A|You first.|ad
B|Uh, I think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh, I don't think it's over.|sv
A|I think that, uh, so many other things have taken over, uh, in the media.|sv
A|But, I think it was just plain greed,|sv
A|and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks.|sv
A|Go ahead loan your money out, you know.|sv
B|I agree with you.|aa
B|I think it had something to do with deregulation,|sv
B|but I believe, uh, more of it was just greed.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I was talking to someone,|sd
A|I can't remember who it was,|sd
A|but he was a small businessman,|sd
A|and he said that the banks were calling,|sd
A|he borrowed some money|sd
A|and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away.|sd
A|They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property|sd
A|and, uh, yeah,|%
A|there, there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned.|sv
B|Well,|%
A|Not just a couple.|sv
B|You know, we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times, you know,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and the list goes on and on.  You  know, of, of just the crimes committed. Much less for criminals that should be indicted.|sd
A|Well I, I agree a hundred  percent.|aa
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|It may have started with HUD too.|sv
A|I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape|sv
A|and that was property|%
A|and, uh, they lost a lot of money there,|sv
A|and then some of these big, these rich people started to,|sv
A|even Murchison here, who owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida.|sd
A|This was several years ago|sd
A|and he lost, you know, all, all of his money before he died.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Not all of it,|sd
A|I don't know how much he lost,|h
A|but, uh, they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit|sv
A|and it always would, it always would increase, you know,|sd
A|it always would, uh, uh, be more than what you paid for it|sd
A|and they just never even got conservative with our money at all.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|It,|%
B|everyone forgets whose money it was.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And, everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I,|%
B|as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I think no American could stand for criminal action.|sv
A|Well now the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all, uh, Reaganomics for, you know,|sd
A|you spend your way to prosperity|sv
A|and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, well, that was the philosophy, you know.|sv
A|Just keep spending until taxes are lower,|sv
A|and, I thought, that's not going to work, you know,|sv
A|and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally.|sv
B|Well,|%
A|And, it hasn't  worked now.|sv
B|In theory,  in theory, a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|no doubt,|ba
A|no doubt.|ba
B|And, if people are making money, people can spend money,|sd
B|and it'll generate taxes.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|I, I, I agree with that,|sv
A|but there's got to be some control|sv
A|and apparently there was, you know,|sv
B|Well, the problem is,|sv
B|and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, for what they would cost|sv
B|and we weren't producing anything.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|We, as Americans weren't producing anything.|sv
B|It was all inflation.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it,|sd
B|we agree too closely,|sv
B|but,  But, you, you can't say that that was right.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I know, uh,|sv
A|Oh, no,|ba
A|I,|%
B|No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other.|sv
A|And, and not high quality ones at that, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well,|%
A|Well,  I do have a lot of confidence in the, the American people and the economy and everything else.|sd
A|I, I feel bad when I see the inefficiency, even here at T I, you know,|sd
A|and I think that the,|sv
A|it, it still,|%
A|a lot of the workers don't understand that, uh, they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them, you know.|sv
B|It is a life and death struggle, with with the Japanese.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I know,|ba
A|and I, when I,|%
A|of course I'm in facilities,|sd
A|and I work with a lot of mechanics|sd
A|and I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce, you know,|sd
A|and they think that, well, I'm paid anyway|sd
A|so it doesn't matter, you know.|^q
B|I, I'm very tired of it all pays by the hour.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, and I'm nonexempt.|sd

B|What, what does a nonexempt sound like?|qw
A|Uh, you're too informed.|sv
A|They're, they're very, they're very, uh, not interested.|sv
A|They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now.|sv
B|Uh,|%
A|I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here.|sd
A|I don't know really.|h
B|Uh, that's,|%
A|I'm being  a Yankee, I guess I'm, I'm letting my Yankee come out, you know.|sd
B|Well, I,|%
B|now maybe I'm not the, uh, typical nonexempt that you deal with.|sd
B|The badge is silver.|sd

B|I don't care what the jobs are, you will not work.|^q
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, it,|%
B|And, and, as far as our, you know, our conversation goes, I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to, the banking structure.|sd
A|Banking?|qy
A|I think that, not, not only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, uh,|sv
A|there was one point I was going to make.|sd
A|I think the last I heard,|sd
A|and I, I have to admit I'm not as informed as them,|sd
A|but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit.|sv
A|Well, I always double that.|sd
A|I figure well, if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes|sv
A|and so if that's true, it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was, that went down the tube somewhere.|sv
B|Uh, it really hurts me, to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's amazing really.|sv
A|It's amazing that,|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I know what you mean.|bh
B|Uh, one of our  senior,|sd
A|Course your value of homes  up there are pretty good.|sv

A|they were going to have big, uh, award,|sd
A|and Secorski got it. Which was Boeing Secorski, this which is up in the north somewhere, you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b

B|Seattle,|sd
B|and  also, uh, they do some of that in Wichita, Kansas.|sd
A|Well, I, I don't,|%
A|they were advertising here that it was Bell, T I.|sd
A|T I was getting the, uh, electronics with Bell,|sd
A|and so, it was a double.|sd
A|One that Bell is in the Metroplex|sd
A|and two, that T I was doing the electronics for them.|sd

B|Secorski Boeing.|^2
A|Secorski, Boeing,|aa
A|Boeing doesn't need the money.|sd
A|Something,|%
