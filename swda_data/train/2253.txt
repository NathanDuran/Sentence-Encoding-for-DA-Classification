B|Yeah.|b
B|So, what's the latest one you've read?|qw
A|Well, I tell you what,|^h
A|I'm a kind of, uh, a history nut.|^h
A|I'm trying to think back now,|^h
A|I read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, the last, uh, I'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that I read, I cannot, right offhand, I tried to read, uh, one of the, the Michener, uh, LONE STAR or the, the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.|sd
B|I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work.|sd
A|Oh, well, I've had similar problems.|sd

B|So, I then read, was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM.|sd
A|BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .|b^m
B|It's kind of like a historical compendium, of the Civil War,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's not a story of the Civil War,|sd
B|it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events, that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's fascinating because I had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?|qy
B|There was a lot more to it than that.|na
B|As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, it was a political move.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the United States.|sv
A|All the other areas which would, I think at that time would have included West Virginia and, oh, may have been Kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the South but still had slaves.|sv

A|isn't much there, was there?|qy
B|They might as well have not even been there.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, they weren't a state|sv

B|and he keeps saying, oh, no.|sd
B|I thought, okay.|sd
A|They supplied some, uh, you know,|%
A|they were some groups of it, the Vicksburg,|sd
A|if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg, the battleground at Vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some Texas, uh, groups|sd
A|and they had an interesting time there.|sv
B|Oh, I'll bet they did.|aa
A|And down there at Sabine Pass, uh, I can't think of the guy's name|sd
A|but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.|sv
B|Well, you know, why they actually held them off?|qh
B|None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar|sv
A|That could be it could be it.|aap_am
B|Now, you didn't hear me say that.|ad
