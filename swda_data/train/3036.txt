B|If you had to pick one, what would you choose?|qw
A|Uh, I would probably go with,|sd

A|I'm forty|sd
A|so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal|sd

A|I mean because it's just,|sd
A|it will always be there.|sd
A|It's classic|sd

B|Uh|%

A|It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.|sv
B|Well, there's some joy in it also.|sd
B|But, mostly it, it just tells a story about life.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I must say, though, uh, I listen to Amy Grant.|sd
A|Do you consider her country?|qy
B|I don't know.|no
B|I'm not all that familiar with her work.|sd
A|Uh, uh, let's see. Well, name some people that are country that I should listen to|ad

B|That's true.|aa
A|You know, so, well, I think there's music all around anyway.|sv
A|I mean, I think life is just music,|sv
A|so, you know, you can hear it wherever you want|sv
A|and, uh, and I've, I've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because I just don't understand it.|sd
