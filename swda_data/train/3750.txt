A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|so you enjoy camping?|qy
B|Oh, yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
B|I,  uh like you, I haven't done any in quite some time  except  for what I call living now which is, which is very close to camping|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|Is it?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|ny
B|You know, I, uh, camped in the Boy Scouts|sd
B|and, you know, my dad and I went out sometimes|sd
B|but uh, even my first, uh, eight or nine years of working, I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, when you have to have it, you have got to have it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, you know, in those those kinds of situations, uh, room rent which is outrageous.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So,  my buddy and I, we just camped|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we figured, what the hell,|sd
B|we did it when we were kids|sd
B|and we loved it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.|sd
B|When, when I was in high school,|%
B|he is a couple years older than me|sd
B|and, uh, he graduated and went off to college|sd
B|and, uh, during the summer we would camp out at the lake.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a  stove|sd
A|Oh, well  Yeah.|b
B|You know, I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, well, it was fantastic.|sd
B|We would get up in the morning, go skiing, uh,|sd
B|that substituted for a shower|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and then we would go to work and uh, come back to the, uh, you know, boat house at night|sd
B|and, uh, in the afternoon, you know, it is still four o'clock.|sd
B|You have got four hours of day light, good skiing left.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it was great.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, you know, now all my life is more like camping than not camping really.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you have electricity out there.|qy
B|Oh,  yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
A|You've got a phone  obviously|sv
B|Well,  actually as a matter of fact, they just ran the phone three years ago.|aap_am
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We didn't have a phone.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They didn't have phone lines.|sd
B|You just couldn't get phones.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, we are at the end of the mail route|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess so,  huh.|aap_am
B|But,  uh, you know, right now, uh, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed, And, uh, swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day,  you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm in construction|sd
B|and, uh, you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here, you know, putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I came home from work one Friday afternoon|sd
B|and our truck was back.|sd
B|Everything we had was in boxes|sd
B|and my wife said, uh, we're moving.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And I said where.|sd
B|And she said out to the trailer.|sd
B|And I said, oh.|sd
B|She said yep|sd
B|and I said okay|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|So, we have been roughing it out here for about three years,|sd
B|but it is not bad.|sd
B|I, we have color T V, microwave  you know|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|it is not horrible,|sd
B|but it's, it's a lot like camping.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|well I grew up in California,  in  in central California right in the valley.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains|sd
A|and, uh, so my dad loved fishing and camping.|sd
A|So we would go up.|sd
A|First, we went up just to, uh, with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our, uh, hot dogs by the fire or whatever.|sd
B|Sure.|ba
A|But then later my mom and dad got a camper|sd
A|so,  uh  we have kind of moved up.|sv
B|Became  civilized.|^2
A|Yeah.|aa
A|A little bit in the world.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|my mom goes camping you know.|sd
B|She takes her, uh, motor home.|sd
B|You know, she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning, color T V, microwave  oven  you know|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|She just,|%
B|roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. You know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, you know, she has a lot of fun.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And mostly, it is just a way to,|%
B|she, she goes to dog shows.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|See, she shows dogs|sd
B|and, uh, you can sneak a dog into a motel|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.|sd
A|No|aa
B|So, she, uh, you know, takes the motor home|sd
B|And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she,|%
B|if he would buy her a motor home|sd
B|So he did|sd
B|But as far as camping, my wife and I have plans to, uh, not really camp per se, but to drive up the, uh, you know, Highway One there in California uh, as soon as we get this house finished.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh that's, uh,  That will be pretty.|ba
