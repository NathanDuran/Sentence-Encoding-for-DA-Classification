B|Right.|b
A|You know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way.|aa
B|It is certainly has affected, uh, U S policy though.|sv
B|There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq.|sv
B|I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|The devastation,|ba
A|yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
B|The only difference was that the government said, okay|sv
B|if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent.|^q
B|And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|aa
A|And in full faction,|sv
B|Which, uh,|%
A|yeah.|%
B|Right.|aa
B|Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.|sv
B|It was sort of, of a president's war rather than a country's war.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it just kind of dragged on.|sv
A|Uh, I do not know how you were historically.|qw^d
A|But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|It seemed to me like it was, it seemed like it was going on forever,|sd
A|I mean, I|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|yeah.|%
A|It really, well,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|in fact, because in terms of when your,|%
A|there is at least ten years between us,|sd
A|so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, it just did not seem that, uh, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera,|sv
A|and you would think, you know, just, uh, how could the government or the Pentagon, uh, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Uh,|b

A|That is true, uh,|aa
A|Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, uh, Vietnamese people as a whole. Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I do not know if they, uh, I do not know if they have that resource or not.|sd

A|But I just think it is kind of a shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there|sv
A|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|uh, so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good.|sv
A|And that one I probably,|%

A|The money is|%
B|So, Yeah.|b
