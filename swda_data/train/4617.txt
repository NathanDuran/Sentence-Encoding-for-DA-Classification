A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I say they, uh,|sd
B|probably the best things to do is, is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water|sv
B|they  they're innocent right.|sv
A|I see.|b
A|A  a good, a good southern solution.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Uh, so, uh, how do you, how do you feel?|qo
B|that's, of course, being facetious|sd
B|but|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|You'd have to say that.|sv
A|Uh, I don't know.|h
A|The, the things they asked to talk about were whether the, uh, whether the judge should be the one that does the, uh, sentencing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And seems to me that that's, I think that's the way it's done now.|sv
A|Uh, at least, my understanding of the law which isn't very good.|h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it|sv
A|and I, I think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is for a particular thing.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I guess, also what the system will absorb|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Probably  more tuned in to that.|sv
B|Possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole,|sd
B|I mean he could have like a personal prejudice.|sv
B|You know, judges are people like  everybody else  even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial|sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|but  maybe, uh,|%
A|And I  think that may, I, that may be an exception as well.|sv
A|Because I think that,|%
A|doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than, than  the judge?|qy
B|I, I think  that's, I think that's the way it is.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, whether they, they decide whether or not they, uh, the accused or whatever would get the, uh, get the death penalty.|sd
B|Do they have a death penalty in California?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|In  fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, there's a big uproar going on right now.  Uh|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|the, uh, Governor, you know, has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, it's someone who had, uh, killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I,|%
B|something like that, I've got no problem with it.  Uh|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I guess the way I think about it is not, it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge.|sv
B|It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|put it to sleep, you know.|ad
B|Just get it out, you know,|ad
B|it's not able to fit in, you know|sd
A|Something inexpensive.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly|aa
B|Uh, I guess, kind of the way I think about it also, is they just,|sv
B|if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty,|sd
B|they got the death penalty,|sd
B|they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with one appeal|sv
B|and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that,|%
A|But I guess  there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake|sd
A|and  you'd hate  to be one of those.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Oh,  I'm sure|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That all the, all verdicts,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|well maybe not.|ar
A|I don't know.|sd
A|At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be  unanimous.|sv
B|I believe  it is  in capital.|sd
B|I think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever How ever many is on, sitting on a jury.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I I believe that's the way it is.|sd
B|But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other eleven.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or, something|sd
A|and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked.|sd
B|Oh, no|ba
A|the judge told them   they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet|sd
B|I'm telling you, go one way or the other.|ad
B|That, that's probably an expensive trial.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Six months so far they said.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Probably.|sv
A|So.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Probably.|sv
B|You know, I'm not sure there's a number.|sv
B|It's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all.|sv
A|Maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people  dial in and give their, uh, vote.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's, that's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was,  you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|That has been going on|sd
B|My, uh, cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami.|sd
A|Oh really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|So she follows that stuff pretty closely.|sd
B|But, uh,|%
A|That's interesting.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|she's not involved in that, that case.|sd
B|But she does,|%
A|Well have you ever served on a jury?|qy
B|No|nn
B|I haven't.|sd
B|I never have.|sd
B|My wife has|sd
B|but I,  I haven't.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I got called|sd
A|but I, uh, never, uh, got selected for a jury|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they had some guy that was, uh, defending himself.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
