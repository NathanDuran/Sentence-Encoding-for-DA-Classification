A|Carolyn, I have a little Schnauzer, little miniature Schnauzer.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|What do you have?|qw
B|Well, it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society|sd
A|You know, those make the best animals, uh, best pets.|sv
A|My, uh, son has a, uh, oh,|sd
A|it's a real mixture,|sd
A|it's part, uh, Doberman and part Husky|sd
B|Oh, my.|ba
A|Yes,|b
A|and they, gentlest dog you ever met,|sd
A|and they got him from the, uh, Humane Society here in Oklahoma City|sd
B|Oh,|b
A|and she's just turned out to be a jewel.|sd
A|My, my little Schnauzer is, is my friend.|sd
A|She is so spoiled.|sd
A|She's a year and a half old now,|sd
A|and being single, she's become very important in my life|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's so nice to have, come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.|sd
B|Well, my children are the ones that wanted our pet,|sd
B|and this one is probably the best one that we have had.|sd
B|Um, as I say, we got it from the Humane Society,|sd
B|and, uh, we had lost a pet,|sd
B|and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost.|sd
B|It got out under the fence while we were on vacation,|sd
B|and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it,|sd
B|but, uh, when we walked in to the, to the Humane Society, this little dog was, uh, in the office and would sit up and beg,|sd
B|and just, oh, he was so cute,|sd
B|and the kids just fell in love with it.|sd
B|We just couldn't leave without it.|sd
B|But, it's, um, whoever had it before must have trained it real well, because it's just, you know, it's, uh, a good house dog.|sd
B|I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it|sd
A|Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, it's a puppy, because I work|sd
A|and I'm not home|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and unfortunately she's not as well trained as, as I would like her to be|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I realize it's my fault,|sd
A|I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian,|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,|sv
A|It is,|aa
A|it is.|aa
A|She's, you know, she's real good,|sd
A|I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything,|sd
B|Um.|%
A|and, and, not one mess does she make|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and then we go outside,|sd
A|and she'll stay outside for, oh, thirty minutes to an hour, come inside and use the restroom.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|I just want to kill her at those times.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|But she's a doll,|sd
A|she's a love,|sd
A|she really is.|sd
B|About the only time we have,|sd
B|well, I shouldn't say the only time,|h
B|but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night,|sd
B|and, uh, she usually stays inside at night.|sd
B|We try to take her out right before we go to sleep,|sd
B|but, uh, sometimes it doesn't work|sd
A|You know, I, I, we always had a pet when I was growing up, oh always had a dog.|sd
A|My mother did not like cats.|sd
A|So we always had a dog,|sd
A|and, and then, course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|I, uh, in fact my children gave me this, this little puppy for Christmas.|sd
B|What a cute idea.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think so|sd
B|Well, we got one one year for Christmas,|sd
B|and, uh, I had a baby the next day|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|and, uh, so that one wasn't really well trained|sd
A|Two babies,|bf
A|huh.|b
A|Oh.|b
B|Oh, I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time,|sd
B|so,|%
A|That, that is really probably bad timing.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I|%
B|it was,|sd
B|it really was.|sd
B|The older kids had wanted one, though,|sd
B|and, you know, we thought, well that would be a fun time for them to have it, you know, get it at Christmas time.|sd
B|It was a little Spitz, a little white fluffy and, you know, looked like it came right from the north pole,|sd
A|Oh, yes,|ba
B|and that was fun,|sd
B|but, um, I, I sure wasn't good at training it|sd
A|Do you|%
B|I think you have to have time, you know to do those things.|sv
A|and patience|^2
A|and you have to, you really have to be, just like your children,|sv
A|when you set a rule you have to stand by it, and be consistent|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|and ...|%
