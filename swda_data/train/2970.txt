A|And my husband is the kind of guy, he's, he's sometime,|sd
A|he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.|sd
A|And I think sometimes it is just, he and I are very different in terms of that.|sd
A|I, I mean, I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|We,|%
A|And, uh, he opened the door.|sd
A|I came downstairs|sd

B|Right, um,|b
B|I do not, I do not know. Because I am not real up on a lot of news things.|no

B|it is a lot of repeat crime.|sv
B|And you are like, why are they repeating?|sv
B|They should have been in there longer.|sv

A|but it has been at least ten years.|sd
A|And you think to yourself, was it that bad back then?|sd
A|Or is it just,|%
A|I think that, like you said, television?|sv
A|Is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it, you know?|qh
A|I mean, people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something.|sv
B|It seems like a lot of,|%
B|that it is more, like in Boston,|sd
B|there was a case of, uh, a couple of kids, fifteen year olds.|sd
B|They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah.|b
A|In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, uh, they had that thing, you know, the high top sneakers, the Air Jordans, et cetera.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Kids killing each other and beating their brains out.|sd

A|Right.|na
A|Or the, or the jackets, the team like the Raiders and the caps.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, stealing the hundred dollar jackets.|sd
A|Uh, I mean, it is I guess, it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they, in Boston.|sv
A|That is crime where they videoed.|sd
A|That is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Where they videotape themselves.|sd
