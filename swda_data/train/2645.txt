B|it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar|sd
B|there's, you know, there's benefits|sd

A|To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's great.|ba

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure,|b

B|Exactly.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b

B|pick out where you want to live,|ad
B|and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.|ad
A|I see that's the problem.|sd
A|For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,  and  where I want to go. And just kind of go with the punches.|sd

A|Oh, I had job offers.|no
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.|sd

B|if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.|ad
B|That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,|sd
B|I'll take a chance,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.|sd
B|Right,|ba
B|there you go.|ba
B|That's the way to do it.|ba
A|And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.|sd
B|There you go,|ba
B|that's the thing to do.|ba
B|That's much funner than doing any kind of job.|ba
