A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|What do you think of the public school system?|qw
A|First off, do you have children that are in it?|qy
B|I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems|na
B|and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,  system|sd
A|Oh, okay|bk
B|So,|%
A|Well then, you should be a good one to know because I, my children are grown now.|sv
A|I now have grandchildren,  in the  school system|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|so, uh, I don't have firsthand experience right now,  with it.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|So what do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job.|sv
B|I think they have a long way to go yet|sv
B|but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.|sv
B|You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,|sd
B|and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.|sv
B|And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.|sv
B|And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,|sv
B|they literally cannot come in out of the rain.|sv
A|That's right|aa
B|You know, and that just,|%
B|I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh,  this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.|sd
B|So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,|sv
B|and I think that's very, very important.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|it is.|aa
A|I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren,|sv
A|we have a, uh, fourth grader|sd
A|and then we have one that's in kindergarten|sd
A|and, and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade|sd
B|and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my Algebra Two, when I was in high school.|sd
A|Is that scary?|qy
B|And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it  before I can help you.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|You know,  so they're really, they're really moving them along|sd
B|but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life.|sd
A|Now,|%
B|And  that's you know,|%
B|a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And, uh, so I think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.|sv
A|Correct.|aa
A|Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?|qy
A|Um, I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.|sd
B|Yes,|ny
B|that's a,|%
A|And, and|%
A|are you, do you find that?|qy
B|Well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,  things  so that they compare|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and . You know, you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.|sd
B|And you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,  you know,  that I think it's, uh, I think it's crazy personally|sv
A|Be,|%
A|uh-huh.|b
B|You know, the the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review|sd
B|but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,  October.  So that you know, your school district shines throughout the United States.|sd
A|Coming up,|^2
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And I think that's totally useless.|sv
B|I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons|sv
B|but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.|sv
B|It's like bragging on your grandchildren.|sv
A|Right|b
B|You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth|sv
B|and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,|sv
B|and that's great.|sd
B|But that's what they're doing with the school systems|sv
B|and they're wasting too much time on that,  I think.|sv
A|Well, I,  I know that this again this, this friend, uh, is in the Plano School District,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  she teaches, uh, uh, it uh, emotionally disturbed children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she says  she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something.|sv
A|I didn't quite understand it.|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|there's a,|%
B|yeah.|%
A|And, uh,|%
B|The bottom  line is always money,|sv
