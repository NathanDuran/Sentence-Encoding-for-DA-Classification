B|well, there's two.|sd
B|I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS|sd
B|of course they wanted to see it.|sd
B|They had the Disney|sd
B|book and they thought that was wonderful|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they loved the dogs,|sd
A|It's one of my favorite even,|sd
B|we went with some friends of ours,|sd
B|and I was a little worried about my son.|sd
B|He's about two and a half|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, you know, that the, the, the puppies are missing|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and it shows the town,|sd
B|and you can hear all the barking,|sd
A|A whole lot,|bf
A|uh-huh|b
A|kind of dark,|sd
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so that kind of bothered him|sd

A|Well, my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE.|sd
B|I loved that movie.|sd
A|They, uh,|%
A|well we do, too,|sd
A|but they just want to rent that one.|sd
A|That is their very favorite.|sd

A|We're not real big movie goers ourselves,|sd
A|but we did try to go see about a month ago that, um, DEAD AGAIN that black and white one,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I was not real impressed with it.|sd
A|In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean,|sd
A|wait, wait run that back,|^q
A|and we couldn't run it back|sd
B|Wasn't that good.|qy^d
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|But we, we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end,|sd
A|and we thought we were being very quiet,|sd
A|this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later.|sd
A|And I'm sorry|fa
B|Oh, no.|bd
A|We're just not real big movie goers.|sd
B|Well, I like to watch the movies,|sd

A|And my husband's name is Bob|sd
A|and he wants to see that|sd
B|it's a funny movie.|sd
A|yeah,|b
A|he wanted to see that.|sd
A|I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, uh, that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|and I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that.|sv
A|The little guy is so cute,|sd
A|and he's terribly rich by now.|sd
B|I hope he stays cute not spoiled, you know,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa

A|I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars|sd
B|Oh, that's pretty good,|ba
A|and I thought well, now that's, that's close enough to being several, you know,|sv
A|you could rent it more than more than four times and watch that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b

A|we rented ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING thinking that would be so cute,|sd
B|Oh, I know.|ba
A|and it's a precious movie,|sd
A|but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,|sd
B|Now, see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,|sd
B|but it's been so long since I watched it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't remember the language.|sd
