A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Now, we used to be big time campers|sd
A|but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What type of camping did you do?|qw
A|Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we went like twenty or thirty at a time.|sd
A|We took, uh, just our little tents,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we did it that way.|sd
A|Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and we did it that way.|sd
B|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|So, we've always enjoyed camping.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent,|sd
B|and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then I bought a van|sd
B|and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable|sd
A|yes.|b
A|Now we have friends with a van,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Like one night|sd
A|and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they enjoy it.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes, to camping.|sd
A|Oh,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Oh, me either.|sd
B|All the bugs and stuff|sd
B|But I, I try|sd
A|I hate to be on all that stuff|sd
B|But, but I try, you know, to, uh, to get out there and enjoy everything.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
B|But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends|sd
B|and he got poison ivy,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and it's all over him.|sd
B|The poor thing, you know,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|so, there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
B|Oh, shoot.|ba
A|Oh.|b
A|But now, I enjoy it every once in a while,|sd
A|I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm a sissy.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I either want to do it in the fall or spring.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|You know?|qh
B|Definitely when it's cool.|bf
A|Yes.|aa
B|Well, have you done much camping around Texas?|qy
A|Well, not really because usually it's when we go off, you know, like for a couple weeks or so.|ng
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's usually like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, have you camped all over the United States?|qy
A|Just about.|na
B|Wow.|ba
A|Just about.|na
B|See now I haven't so that,|sd
B|I bet you that's an experience there.|sv
A|Oh, it really is.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It really is.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|It's a lot easier then.|sd
B|Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot,|sd
B|and they, uh, they've been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama. And, uh, which is really, really neat.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|I'd like to go anywhere.|sd
A|You know, I just like to go.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I really do.|sd
B|Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and, and those parts, in the mountains?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|not really,|ng
A|not that much.|sd
A|Um, we've been, well, we've been to Wyoming, you know, and Kentucky and Montana and, you know, places like that.|sd
A|But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston. You know|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Oh, yeah,|ba
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
A|Yes.|b
B|But we're, uh, we're getting more into it|sd
B|and we've done, uh, we've done quite a bit|sd
B|and, uh, uh, the kids like to go out, you know, as often as they can.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, so that's good.|sd
B|You know, they're, they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It is.|sd
A|My children really enjoys it.|sd
A|They really do.|sd
A|But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, you know,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and it's so hot.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And our camper doesn't have an air conditioner.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's one of those pop-ups.|sd
A|I'm sure you could put one in probably,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but we hadn't did that.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|%
B|well, that's really neat.|ba
A|Yes,|b
B|Well,|%
A|we all enjoy camping.|sd
A|And they're, you know, they're in like and scouts and stuff like that, you know, so, they get to go camping in those organizations also.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|At least their Daddy goes with them,|sd
A|I don't, when they do that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, That really is.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that's neat.|ba
B|That's really neat.|ba
A|Well, how old is your boys, your children?|qw
B|Well, I, well, I have, um, a son that's, uh, going to be eleven here pretty soon, and then a daughter that's thirteen.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, they're, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and, cooking and, and all that kind of stuff too.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|So, that's, that's really neat.|ba
A|It really is.|sd
A|Mine's eleven and eight.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, they really enjoy it too.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I agree with you.|aa
B|They like to get out there|sd
B|and, but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to, to get out there|sd
B|and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy|sd
B|and it got all into his eye|sd
B|and it was really swollen|sd
B|and, uh, so they had to give him shots and everything,|sd
B|so.|%
B|oh, well, maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular trees, or what, bushes, whatever they are|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yes.|b
A|Yes.|b
A|Oh.|b
A|But I have, uh, brother-in-law and a sister, you know, that just really just camp.|sd
A|You know, they love to go camping.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They could, they would all the time they wanted, you know, wanted to because there's nothing holding them back.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I'm just not that involved in it.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|now I like to go out like several times a year.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But not on a, on the regular basis.|sd
B|I have some friends who go out every single weekend, when, you know, in the season.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, and, and I just couldn't do that, you know.|sd
A|Me, I haven't really as far as entertainment,|sd
A|I don't know what you would do every you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But I guess, my entertainment's, television, I guess|sd
B|Just getting away.|^2
B|Yeah,|b
B|right,|b
B|right,|b
B|see, I see, they just want to get away.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But every Friday night they'll go home, you know, straight from work|sd
B|and they'll pack up|sd
B|and, you know, and then they'll leave,|sd
B|and I'm just going, you know,|sd
B|by Friday night I just want to crash, you know,|sd
B|and I want to go home and, you know, do all that, and then, uh, get out on the road to boot,|sd
A|Oh, I don't either|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But anyway that's their life|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|But they probably live in a city also,|sv
A|don't they?|^g
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|that's true.|sd
A|Well, see, we're in a real small county area,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, that makes a big difference.|sv
B|Now that's true.|aa
B|That's true.|aa
A|Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know|sd
B|Yeah|aa
B|That's true.|aa
A|That makes a difference.|sv
B|Well, it was nice talking with you.|fc
A|It was nice talking to you too,|fc
