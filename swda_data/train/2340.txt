B|Yeah,|ny
B|you?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk about, just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts,|sd
A|and I thought, I better make some calls.|sd
B|I know,|aa
B|I know,|aa
B|they.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I haven't had a chance, I haven't got a chance to look at them yet.|sd
B|It was a lot nicer than I expected.|sd
A|My daughter, uh, got a few calls at home.|sd
A|She talked to some student in,|sd
A|I guess they give them to computer students, too, in, uh, Virginia, something like that.|sd
A|She's talked to two students.|sd
B|I've talked to,|sd
B|I don't think they were students,|sd
B|one, I think, worked at a university, university um, and the furthest away I've talked to someone has been New York.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|great.|ba
A|Uh, we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, I guess, uh,|ad
B|Yes,|aa
B|we are.|aa
A|Do you have anybody that you, uh, are close to that decision on, or anything,|qy
A|or, I've thought about it for myself and all,|sd
A|and my my wife's mother is in a retirement home.|sd
A|She's not in a nursing home. Uh.|sd
B|Oh, well that's a,|%
B|did you push the button?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|did I, didn't we push?|qy
B|Did we,|qy^d
A|Let me, I'll hit it again just in case.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|just in case|sd
A|I did it as she said,|sd
A|yes.|%
A|But, uh, she's she's down in San Antonio|sd
B|Now, what,|%
B|Oh.|b
A|and it's, it's a, uh, it's a brand new one.|sd
A|It's a Catholic, uh, retirement home for nuns.|sd
A|It's at, uh Trinity, uh,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|no,|ar
A|let me see, Trinity,|^h
A|I keep calling it|sd
A|it's not Trinity,|ar
A|I'll think of,|%
A|Incarnate Word,|sd
A|and they have a retirement home for the nuns|sd
B|Well, isn't that neat.|ba
A|and they take some lay people.|sd
B|Isn't that neat.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and that one's really super.|sd
A|Now I, I know what they're talking about on regular retirement.|sd
A|Yeah,|%
A|there's not too many,|%
A|they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know have nurses.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|And then they have other wings that we visited, uh, that are very nice.|sd
A|I mean it's just super.|sd
B|That's neat.|ba
B|Just supervised more or less than anything and security, I guess.|qy^d
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|they, they, they have, uh, like, uh, a guard with locks.|sd
A|We've been there once at night at Christmas.|sd
A|She just went in last year.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|She drives and everything,|sd
A|she, she, she's perfectly healthy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh,|b
B|What made you all decide to put her, or what made her decide to go?|qw
A|Well, her husband died.|sd
A|They were in the military together,|sd
A|and she just did not want to take care of the house|sd
B|Right|b
A|and she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind, so to speak,|sd
A|and so she's happy as, as heck,|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|and they serve meals, of course.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|They have clubs and a swimming pool,|sd
A|so that's nice.|ba
A|Now I, I know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they were all more or less hospitalized type you know, really, really sick.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Shut-ins and,|%
A|It's a tough question.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it really is.|aa
B|I worked in one as a teenager.|sd
B|I volunteered,|sd
A|Oh, you got more experience than I do then on it.|sd
B|Well, it was really, it was really sad, heartbreaking, I guess.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|And, uh, I just, oh, I just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited.|sd
A|Oh, that would be awful.|sv
B|That just bothered me.|sd
A|I never thought about that, you know.|sd
B|That just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,|sd
B|I was probably about fourteen.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that really made a bad impression on me|sd
B|I always thought, not really bad of them, I mean, because they are, most of them I believe are probably pretty good for the people,|sd
B|but, I don't know.|h
B|It's just a, it would be a tough, tough decision.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think that, uh, hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,|sv
A|and they're getting nicer.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I've seen on T V where they take animals and young children,|sd
A|in fact my daughter is one.|sd
A|My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,|sd
A|and boy that really pumps them up.|sv
B|Helps,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|That is very nice to see young people.|sv
A|I think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
A|If you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything, you know|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|you can't take care of them,|sv
A|kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but it's nice to have them visit and everything.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and get that youth back.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, um, just stationary|sv
A|Right.|b
B|I mean, they'll get in a wheelchair|sv
B|or they'll just sit in a chair|sv
B|and, and, until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,|sv
B|and I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long.|sd
B|So I do, love to see young kids go and, and men take the pets and everything.|sd
B|I think that's a real, real neat idea.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think you do get more by by stimulation.|sv
A|My, in fact, my mother in law just visited.|sd
A|She's just about seventy-five. Again, perfectly fine.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, one, and, and she visited us here in, in Dallas.|sd
A|When she went back, every time she goes back to, uh, San Antonio, my wife has two sisters there, too, she said she's much better,|sd
A|she's much more alive and, and, uh, active when she's been on a visit with somebody else, you know|sd
B|That's,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and she's much,|%
A|and so the stimulation part is really important. I think, like any animal, anything|sv
B|Right.|b
A|you just lay around, uh, that's the fastest way to die, I think, you know.|sv
B|Stagnant|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's exactly right.|aa
B|I think they're really neat.|sv
B|Um, of course I've seen those reports on T V, the horrible ones|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and that scares me.|sd
A|I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper.|sd
A|Anything bad, I like, I like to, flip, I flip it off.|sd
A|But it's sad,|sv
A|it's sad,|sv
A|yeah.|%
B|It's sad to think that we would do that to people,|sv
B|and you know, I've seen them on T V with, uh, bed sores,|sd
B|and oh, they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And I just think, how can you do that?|sd
B|These people have given so much of their lives, you know, to, to America you know, whatever,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and here is how we treat them.|sv
B|Just put them in a home and leave them.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|When I was, uh, younger, we, I lived in the East,|sd
A|I'm from the East really,|sd
A|and it seemed like there were several people that I knew that had their, uh, parents, I guess they would be, but well in their|sd
A|living with them.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And one of them was even a woman who was fairly old,|sd
A|and I guess she, she had her own separate room.|sd
A|And I think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because I was younger|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and it's just not a custom anymore to have, uh, you know, the grandparents live with you anymore.|sv
A|I guess that, uh well, we aren't getting away from that, which is not right.|sv
B|I think,|%
B|Right.|aa
B|I think it's neat.|sv
B|I think, uh, you learn a lot from them from all their experiences,|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and, and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories.|sd
A|Oh, right,|b
A|right.|b
B|I think that's neat,|sv
B|because they really have a lot of good insights that my my husband's father is really old.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|He, he had him late in life,|sd
B|and he's, he'll be eighty this year.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And I just, uh, he lives with different, you know, people in the family.|sd
B|He'll switch from time to time.|sd
B|I just,|%
A|Well, that's nice in a lot of ways.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I just couldn't imagine locking,|sd
B|not locking him up, but putting him in a home and just,|sd
A|Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|%
A|right,|%
B|Lock him up.|sd
A|That's what I think about it for me,|sd
A|I think, Well, my kids better not do that to me.|sd
B|I know,|aa
B|I know.|aa
A|I don't want that, you know.|sd
A|So I, I think of it, Well, how would I want to be treated rather than, well,|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|it's easy to say, Oh, yeah,|sv
A|let's put these old folks in a home,|^q
A|but when I think I don't want to do that, you know.|sd
A|I don't want to be|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|I'd want to have my little home.|sd
A|I always threaten my daughters,|sd
A|I say, Well, I'm going to build a little house behind yours,|sd
A|and I'll take care of your lawn, he says,|sd
A|but I'm not going to one of those places.|^q
B|Oh, you're going to put me away.|^q
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|That's what my mother,|sd
B|she always,|%
B|You're going to lock me up one day, aren't you.|^q
B|I can tell,|^q
B|you're going to lock me up.|^q
A|That's what we, that's the way we call it, which is really wrong.|sv
B|I know.|aa
A|But my wife's mother, and the one, she's in San|sd
A|it's everything but.|sd
A|The opposite of what you've seen.|sd
A|I mean it's a little hotel, you might say.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That's great.|ba
A|Again, a swimming pool, and grounds,|sd
A|and she has enough room.|sd
A|She has two bedrooms, and a, and a separate living area.|sd
B|Gosh.|ba
A|They don't have kitchens or anything|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but they have little, it's like uh, on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal, you know.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Prepare your,|^2
B|Well, that's great.|ba
B|Now can she leave, um, on a day by herself?|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|it's, it's, it's nothing like that.|sd
A|It's like living in the hotel.|sd
A|I mean she's totally on her own.|sd
B|Oh, man.|ba
B|That's neat.|ba
A|Uh, and she still drives, which we do, does scare us some, because she has dented a few things, you know,|sd
A|and we keep thinking about that, you know|sd
B|Right.|b
A|because she, they get less alert,|sv
A|and they don't care,|sv
A|and I've seen some of these elderly people on T V you know, the ones from Florida that just run into people|sd
A|and they don't even understand what happened, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I know,|aa
B|bless their hearts,|ba
B|you hate to hurt them by doing that,|sv
B|that's like their one last thing that they can still do,|sv
A|I know.|aa
B|and you take away that driving ability|sv
B|and that would really be hard.|sv
B|We've, Well, we've thought about doing that for my husband's father, because he,|sd
A|I, I know.|aa
A|Go ahead,|ad
A|I'm sorry.|fa
A|Oh, he still drives?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|That's well, it's wonderful in one respect,|ba
A|but I don't know if you can afford the insurance,|qy^d
A|yeah.|%
B|Well, luckily he drives a big old tank|arp_nd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, he, I mean, I don't think he, he could get hurt.|sv
B|I just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone.|sd
B|But he he hasn't had any accidents luckily.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's good.|ba
A|I mean, people are all different.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|I, I wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe not take their maybe give them a refresher driving course, and just to see how well they are every five years.|sv
B|I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY.|sd
A|Are they doing it?|qy
B|They, um, you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that.|no
B|And I think that would be a great idea, because I think they do, come, become less aware,|sv
B|and they just, I don't know, they, and they don't hear as well, for one thing|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and that doesn't help.|sv
A|Well, everybody needs retraining.|sv
A|It doesn't hurt, uh, you know,|sv
A|the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches,|sv
A|and I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|It would sure, the insurance companies would, would probably help pay for some of that, you know.|sv
B|At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|there you go,|ba
A|there's a good point|ba
B|It's on the state|sv
A|very good point.|ba
A|Very good point.|ba
A|But I think they maybe, should do that,|sv
A|and then the families,|%
