B|Cats are pretty independent, you know,|sd
B|you feed them|sd
B|and they keep themselves clean|sd
B|and, if you, if you raise them right, you know, you don't have to worry about the litter box thing, where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.|sd

B|they want the, they want the fun part and not the, not the work.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That, that kind of gripes on me some,|sv
A|but, but I don't know.|h
B|Well if you're, if you're going to have a pet,  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to, you know deal with the consequences, take care of the offspring|sv
A|More and more people are,|^2
A|Right,|b

A|I think that's really true.|aa
B|and, and it was a real positive thing,|sv
