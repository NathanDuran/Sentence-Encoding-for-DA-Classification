A|Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.|sd
A|I get most of my news information from T V.|sd
A|Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I find it one of the best.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS|sd
B|and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,|sd

B|and,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS|sd
A|and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.|sd

A|and, uh I don't know|h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it,|%
A|I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.|sd

B|Yeah.|b

A|and it got so depressing|sd
B|Yeah|b

A|Yes,|b
A|yes.|b
A|I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and they kind of capsize it and everything|sv

B|Yeah.|b
B|That's true.|ba
A|You know.|%
B|I wanted a little more detail like, you know,|sd
B|they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.|sd
B|And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought that was very interesting,|sd
A|and I thought that was very important for kids.|sd
A|Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.|sd
B|Huh.|b
