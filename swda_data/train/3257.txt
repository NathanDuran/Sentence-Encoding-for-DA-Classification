B|and I guess a lot of times when I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay for them|sd
A|Yes|b
B|I guess I, I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there, so I don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, I tend to go to my premium channels first,|sd
