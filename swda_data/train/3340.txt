A|So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?|qo
B|I think in some professions it's, uh, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, uh, train conductors uh, on drugs.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently,|sd
A|and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana,|sd
A|I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay|sd
B|Oh, my goodness,|ba
A|and it would,|%
A|that would, tied up traffic for a long time,|sd
A|everybody died,|sd
A|the fire was terrible,|sd
A|it was awful.|sd
A|So, yeah,|%
A|I think you're right,|sv
A|I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field,|sv
A|but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,|qh
B|They,|%
B|that's, that is a problem|sv
B|and every time before they get into a vehicle I mean.|qh
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that make sense?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|uh, it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh career.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and then, uh, I think,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I don't, I don't know.|h
B|however, here in Dallas uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,|sd
B|and was to the point, he was on probation,|sd
B|he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract,|sd
B|and they wouldn't have to pay him,|sd
B|and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him,|sd
B|but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice|sd
B|and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem|sd
B|and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
B|so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.|sd
A|Get rid of him.|^2
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,|sd
B|he's been in the paper, in jail,|sd
B|and it's just been awful|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and talk about a terrible role model,|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible you know,|sv
A|it's really funny though, um,|sv
A|I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school|sd
B|Um.|%
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school|sd
A|and a friend came and got me,|sd
A|and I was there,|sd
A|and I could smell the dope,|sd
A|and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and nothing ever happened,|sd
A|and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,|sd
B|Oh, that's terrible.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I really, uh,|%
A|I'm so anti drunk driving,|sd
A|and, and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on the subject.|sd
B|I think most of us are.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|but as I've, as soon as that happened,|sd
A|I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|if you know someone,|sv
B|for example we have, uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,|sd
B|and, uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school|sd
A|Right.|b
B|he went through surgery after surgery|sd
A|Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff.|sd
B|and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.|sd
B|And he,|%
B|as far as his athletics, he's lost all of that.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|He, uh, has been tutored,|sd
B|and he'll catch up in school and everything,|sd
B|but, he's still not back where he was.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I don't think somebody,|sv
B|He may never have  all those motor skills back.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life.|sd
A|You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.|sv
B|Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.|sd
B|Well, he, the train missed him,|sd
B|but, uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|he was in a coma for four months,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he's out of the coma now,|sd
B|and eventually they think he will come back,|sd
B|but you don't know that,|sd
B|and|%
A|Right.|b
B|but he's lost,|sd
B|he was an outstanding football player,|sd
