A|Okay, um, well,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|the first thing,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|uh, what do you think you would offer as far as, uh, information about selecting a school?|qw
B|Well, first I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to, what they want to do.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, once they have that, then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves, and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of, uh, of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer.|sv
A|Yeah, uh,|b
A|do you, do you feel that the first two years that the, um,|qy
A|depending upon the field, I know there are some fields which a person should go to the school, that school, all four years,|sd
A|but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|a lot fields are,|sv
B|most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway.|sd
B|It's, it's your core education, your general general education requirements.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, if, you know, if they want to get a liberal arts degree, I don't, I don't know what advice I'd give them.|sd
B|Go to the school you'd like to go to.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's what I did|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I didn't care about the program or anything else.|sd
B|I went where I wanted to go.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|What was your degree in?|qw
B|Uh, political science.|sd
A|Political science, oh,|b^m
A|okay.|bk
A|Well, I I know, I'm going to school right now,|sd
A|and, uh, I have a friend,|sd
B|Where are you at?|qw
A|Uh, U T D.|sd
A|University of Texas, Dallas.|sd
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|I guess, everybody's in Dallas that I talk to.|sv
B|I'm in, North Carolina.|sd
A|I know.|aa
A|That's where Texas Instruments is.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Um, something that I, I think that I've noticed that|sd
A|I, I have a friend,|sd
A|I think if you're going into like, uh, law or medicine, a very particular, very specific field, even, even engineering, you can get, you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public, um, institution.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|And, uh, it's a lot cheaper.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|My parents, my parents made a mistake in, uh, in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|And she found out after that,|sd
A|she said, you know, my parents, they just, they really wasted a lot of money.|sd
A|This is about twenty years ago.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, well, right now I just,|sd
A|I mean as far as selecting, selecting a school, I, I, I feel that, uh, a lot of it depends upon the major.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it does. Um,|sv
B|I didn't know what I wanted to do after I got my, my degree.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, originally I had planned, uh, undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration.|sd
B|And I went ahead and pursued that.|sd
B|I, I got as far as the thesis, and decided, To hell with it,|sd
B|I didn't want it.|sd
B|Um, and from that point I went to law school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so, but I, I, I really did enjoy the law.|sd
B|I mean, that's, that's where I wanted to be,|sd
B|but I didn't want to go through the, uh, the hassle that the law schools put you through, because I never did want to be a practicing attorney.|sd
B|I just wanted a law degree.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field. Because that's the nuts and bolts of the law, and that's what I like,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So that's, that's what I'm pursuing right now|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and I'm pretty happy with it so far.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I'm, I'm pursuing what they, what's, what's called an interdisciplinary field.|sd
A|I'm a speech therapy major|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and fortunately I have a lot of, I have a good medical background,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,|%
B|that's probably very useful.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's, it's actually turning out to be more, more useful than what I thought.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, I also have a good languages background, linguistics. And some psychology.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, it's all working together.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|The only field I'm not familiar with really is education, which is required, requires about four or five different fields really.|sd
B|Oh, good grief.|ba
A|So it's a,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher,|sd
B|but I, I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while, just to get my feet wet.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|sd
B|I said, uh, I couldn't do this everyday.|sd
B|No way.|sd
A|Well.|%
B|Maybe, maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing, but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing.|sv
A|Oh, so you are a disgruntled graduate student|bf

A|Um, I know one time I was in a political science class,|sd
A|and you know, talking about fields, people going into different fields, I made an off, off the cuff remark about lawyers, about their integrity being questionable.|sd
A|And I mean, oh, that was like a can of worms.|sd
B|Probably, you probably got everybody on you, because they were probably all going to law school.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|there was a woman,|sd

B|you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|If you have any doubts whatsoever, you better not get into it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
