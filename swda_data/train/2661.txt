B|What are you interested in in restaurants?|qw
A|Right, uh.|b
A|So.|%
B|Uh, once a week, twice a week?|qy
A|Oh, at least once a week.|sd
A|We're, we're retired now.|sd
A|When we working out we ate out more than that|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I understand.|ba
B|Uh, but we both work|sd
B|and we have a daughter,|sd
B|and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.|sd
A|Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?|qw
B|Uh, really, I'm kind of open on food.|sd
B|I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer.|sd
B|I'll, uh, try anything once.|sd
A|Right.|b

B|I hate franchised restaurants.|sd
A|You what?|br
A|You,|%
B|I despise franchised restaurants.|sd
A|Oh I,|%
B|I, I, I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run. Uh, some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I know what you mean.|sd
A|I like some ambiance,|sd
A|and I like good food.|sd
A|I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.|sd
B|I don't,|sd
B|but I don't like something fake or put on either.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I don't know why that is.|sd
B|I think it's probably due to pricing, often.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it|sd
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
A|I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and seven courses isn't what I usually look for|sd
B|It is what you look for?|br
B|Oh, isn't, isn't.|b^m
B|Uh, I try to get my money's worth.|sd
A|Right|aa
B|And not just that, I try to, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and, and flavor and texture and care.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Presentation|bf
A|and,|%
B|Well, presentation's not always all of it either.|arp_nd
A|Well, like we, we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently,|sd
B|It's, it's important.|sv
A|and we're trying to give them a little patronage.|sd
A|But Sunday we went there,|sd
A|and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|something a little extra|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's what I mean by,|sd
B|and just for color if nothing else.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.|sd
A|Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|home cooked Tex-Mex.|b^m
B|Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I know.|sd
A|Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,|sd
A|and we've really gotten to like,|sd
A|we like the real Mexican food better than Tex-Mex.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, there's real Mexican food|sd
B|and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican, you know, by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|It's all pretty good, isn't it?|qy
B|Oh, yes,|ny
B|and, and there's big differences, of course,|sv
B|and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, in because its regional, too.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|uh-huh,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|So.|%
A|I'm originally from Maine,|sd
A|so we like seafood, too.|sd
A|And that's something we don't get here,|sd
A|and we're in the mountains in Virginia.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And most of the seafood's frozen.|sd
B|Uh, yeah|aa
B|that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.|sd
B|No fresh, or almost no fresh seafood|sd
A|Right.|aa
B|and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|Lots of shrimp.|sd
B|And, yeah,|aa
B|here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation.|sd
B|And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week.|sd
A|I know it|ba
B|And it was,|%
B|I was like a man starving at every meal.|sd
A|I know the feeling.|ba
A|We do the same thing.|sd
A|My son-in-law is a Texan,|sd
A|and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there|sd
B|It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?|qy
B|Lobster?|^g
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
A|It's like two ninety-eight a pound for a pound lobster.|sd
B|It's like shrimp on the Gulf.|sd
B|Two ninety-eight a pound.|b^m
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store.|sd
A|Oh yeah,|aa
A|cheaper,|sd
A|right.|aa
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|A lot of the restaurants you can get two two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety-nine.|sd
B|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|I've got to go to Maine then rattling in|sd
B|You may have sold a trip for some time.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's a good place to go.|sv
B|Uh, it sounds wonderful.|sv
B|Uh, so,|%
A|Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.|sd
B|That sound good.|sv
B|Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little uh, seafood shacks, we've called them.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. You know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|We went to|sd
B|shrimp straight out of the bay.|sd
A|We were in Galveston last year right well, the first of this year, actually.|sd
B|Hm.|b
A|And, ate in a restaurant,|sd
A|and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.|sd
B|Was it true?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|It wasn't.|ng
A|On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.|sd
A|And they had,|sd
A|it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,|sd
A|and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.|sd
B|Hm.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.|sd
A|They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.|sd
B|Uh, yes,|b
B|the cajuns.|bf
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|It was wonderful.|sd
B|They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, have you eaten crawfish yet?|qy
A|Uh, I tried it,|na
A|but I didn't care for it.|sd
A|Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.|sd
B|Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.|sv
A|That's probably true.|aap_am
A|It,|%
A|We just,|%
A|he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.|sd
B|Uh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|It,|%
B|there's all kinds,|sd
A|Probably needed some cold beer with it|sv
A|and|%
B|So you do eat out a lot.|qy^d
A|Quite a bit.|na
B|One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|We used to do that, once in a while,|sd
A|but we don't anymore.|sd
B|Uh, we still find it fun.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|It's fun,|aa
A|but it's just so much food|sd
A|Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable|sd
B|Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.|sd
A|Do you,|bh
A|well that makes a difference.|sv
B|And so,|%
A|Where do you go to brunches?|qw
A|Like at hotels, or restaurants there?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|uh-huh.|b
A|We eat at Shoney's.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well,|sd
B|but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that sounds nice.|ba
B|It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|I imagine it is.|ba
B|I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch.|sd
B|You know, and it's not that far.|sd
B|It's thirty miles.|sd
A|out of, which direction?|qw
B|Colorado Springs.|sd
A|Out of, which direction from there?|qw
B|West|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|west out of Colorado Springs.|sd
