B|they,|%
B|I think they have a good head on their shoulders.|sv
B|I think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, uh, dogs that I have encountered.|sv
A|Schnauzers, in particular probably.|sv
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|but also some poodles, uh|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|they're kind of,|sv

A|Yeah,|b
A|they're bred down so much.|sv
A|It's,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They aren't the best pets.|sv
B|I, I'd, I really don't know what the best pet is.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal. And bull dogs|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean, some people seem fairly well suited for for, uh, miniature poodles and such.|sv
B|But I don't know about these, uh, these, uh, uh, these pincers, these, now, what are they called. Pit bulls, pit bulls that are so vicious.|sd
A|Pit bull.|^2

A|People, uh, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like, they, uh, fit collars and stuff on them|sd
A|and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, uh, kind of like medium intelligence. Uh,|sd
B|Well, how do they become|qw
B|how did they get their reputation, then?|qw
A|Well, because some people, uh, want to train them as,|sd
B|Oh, they train them to be that way, then.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Yeah,|b
A|it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really  respond.|sd
B|Oh, dear,|ba
B|so the  the poor animal is doing it in self protection.|bf
A|Right.|aa
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they aren't, they aren't by nature really nasty critters.|sd
A|They are very determined critters|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so once you get them going, it's not good to to deal with, but, they, I, I really like them. *two utts?|sv
A|I was, I was impressed by them.|sd
A|They're, they're real sturdy little critters|sd

B|Yeah,|aa
B|they're banned from, in some areas I understand.|sd
A|Well, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, any, any, any pet's going to, can, can be bad if you train it to be that way.|sv
B|You know, that,|%
B|they must have just targeted that breed and said, boy, we're going|sv
A|Well, yeah,|b
A|it's, when,|%
A|in my hometown, they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret, uh, attacking a a child in a house.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret.|sd
A|The, the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Oh, did it attack the child, then?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it, it bit him.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that was, that was not a good thing,|sv
A|but I think it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was it was a fairly wild ferret.|sv
B|Well, the the people that owned him should have been on the  lookout for that.  Sure,|sv
A|Hadn't, they hadn't,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean  they really should have, should have expected it. And taken the precautions.|%
A|They didn't.|sd
B|yeah.|aa
A|It's too bad it happened, though.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|because then the, the animal's in trouble, and not the person.|sd
A|Right.|aa
