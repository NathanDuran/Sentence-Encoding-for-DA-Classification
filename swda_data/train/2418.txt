A|Well, I guess I do,|na
A|I do have a long-term budget|sd
A|I got a daughter in college and one going to be in college|sd
A|so that, I've been thinking about that for quite a while.|sd
A|Now monthly, no.|sd
A|I'll tell you a funny story about budgeting,|sd
A|and I've been married twenty-six years|sd
A|and I did, you know, that the macho thing,|sd
A|the man always did the bills for, I don't know, fifteen years or more,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I got so sick of it, trying to balance the budget, uh, one,|sd
A|and I always tried to show my wife, you know, here's how you,|sd
A|once a year I'd say, here's how you do the budget in case I get sick,|sd
A|or here's how you do the checks, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|One day I gave her the checkbook|sd
A|and I said, I'm not doing this anymore.|sd
A|You do it,|^q
A|you learn it,|^q
A|and I've been happy ever since.|sd
B|Well, that's great.|ba
B|How about your,|qo
A|She does it all now for about ten years,|sd
A|and I don't even,|sd
A|she complains to me about it,|sd
A|she threatens me to give it back to me,|sd
A|and I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't, fooled with that checkbook, you know|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So I know it's a big pain to try to do that.|sv
B|It really is.|aa
B|It, it really is.|aa
B|You know, that was always a, a major problem in our marriage.|sd
B|What I have always identified is I am basically good with money.|sd
B|It, I don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it.|sd
B|I, think that comes from never having enough.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, I'm always afraid of I'm going to need some and where will it be.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|oh, yeah.|b
B|So, um, no,|nn
B|I, I've, I've finally worked myself into a spot where I can budget.|sd
B|When I, when I was first divorced, I had, um, I sat down and budgeted|sd
B|and I had outgo that was much higher than what I had coming in.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|I think, uh, that that is a tough, uh,|sv
A|we all,|%
A|seems to seems to be that way.|sv
B|I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me,|sd
B|and, and so now that I've gotten, you know, I lost the house. Now that I've gotten past that, I can sit down and say, okay,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|this is the reality.|^q
B|This is how much money I have each month.|^q

A|they give us ten minutes, uh.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, the only advice I give you on college would be, there's a lot of scholarship money out there.|sv
A|My daughter got a little bit, not much, only first year|sd
A|she got about two thousand dollars worth,|sd
A|and you ought to, well, as your daughters approach the college age, uh, start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there|ad
A|and, uh,|%
B|And, and how did your daughter get scholarship money on?|qw
A|Uh, band.|sd
A|She got, you know, five hundred dollars at a, at a clip through bands, through leadership.|sd
A|Uh, there's all kinds of civic organizations that will give you, you know, one shot money.|sd
A|Uh, you get a president's award if you're, you're in, in high school doing|sd
A|this up by, here in Arlington. Uh,|sd
A|there's a lot of,|sd
A|and, of course, you, if you, you score high on the S A T, you can get, you know, two thousand a year, you know, or more.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wow.|ba
A|You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades.|sd
A|She, she did very well in school|sd
A|and, uh, but she only got first year money.|sd
A|She got about two thousand dollars.|sd
A|It was only five hundred, dollars at a clip from this organization.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We called.|sd
A|There were, there were two or three people,|sd
A|there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away|sd
A|and only two or three people applied.|sd
A|She applied and got five hundred dollars from that.|sd
B|Wow,|ba
A|So, look into that bit,|ad
B|oh, I'm definitely going to be actively looking into that.|aa
A|The year that they graduate, you know, before, though, you know, while they're graduating , there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away, churches and everything,|sd
A|and they don't even have a dozen applicants because, uh, uh, the kids are going off after the big money.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, of course, you have to have some sort of record in high school, uh, of, of achievement and everything,|sd
A|but sometimes it's just, uh,|sd
A|like our band gave money away.|sd
A|We're a band booster club.|sd
A|We gave, we give, uh, two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids, uh, who we think were worthy, you know|sd
A|so, There's money out there.|sd
B|Well, that's great to know.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's good.|ba
A|Go ahead,|ad
A|you can talk.|ad
A|I, I don't want to, I want to chew up the whole line here.|sd
B|Oh, well, you're doing, you're doing just fine,|sv
B|and, and, uh, actually I, when I talk I usually like to ask a lot of questions.|sd
B|I was wondering what you do at T I.|qw^d
A|Oh, I'm an engineer.|sd
A|I'm, uh, in fact, I'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything.|sd
A|Uh, my job,|sd
A|there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved|sd
A|and so they put me on nights.|sd
A|I, I call this my recession job.|sd
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|And I'm working nights just kind of covering, uh, shutdown equipment and everything, and just being available, here.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't mind.|sd
A|Uh, it beats being laid off and everything.|sd
A|And, uh, you, you got to be a little flexible.|sv
B|Oh, absolutely.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school|sd
A|and then I'd like to teach, maybe mathematics or something.|sd
A|I'm trying to study for that now.|sd
B|Oh, I hope you can do that.|sd
A|Right, uh,|b
B|What, what I did is|sd
B|I was approached|sd
B|and, and I've, I went to T I just right at the time that, uh, my marriage was ending.|sd
B|I had been a, a stay at home mom|sd
B|and, and I, I was very fortunate in starting,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I really enjoyed it while I was at T I,|sd
B|but, you know, the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening|sd
B|and I had less than five years|sd
B|and, also, I wanted to make a little bit more money.|sd
B|So I decided I'd like to go out and try sales.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I'm, I'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And the potential there is fantastic.|sd
A|Oh, sure.|b
B|The reality of it is it's tough|sd
A|Well, it's tough right now for everybody.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful.|sd
A|Hey, I've got another clue for you for college.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Another clue for you for college money.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|Go to work for U T.|ad
A|Uh, we have a friend who works, who is a secretary for T C U, you know, up here?|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, if you're, if you work for T C U.|sd
B|They do?|bh
A|Yes.|ny
A|So check that one out, you know.|ad
B|I'm going to check that.|aa
B|I've got, I've got two friends that work at, at U T.|sd
B|I didn't know that all.|sd
A|Ask them about it.|ad
A|Call them.|ad
B|Definitely, I will.|aa
A|And, because it's full, full scholarship.|sd
A|Now, it's, uh, not room and board,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U.|sd
B|Well, that sounds fantastic.|ba
A|And her, her mother went over there just for that ...|sd
