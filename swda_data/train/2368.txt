B|yeah,|%

B|yeah,|%
B|in,|%
B|actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too,|sd

A|and these|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, I guess they know they're going to get it,|sv
B|And then I think that, um, nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just,|sv
B|I mean, we've been in ours for about ten years,|sd
B|but, uh there's no investment in it,|sd
B|you know all it allows you to do is itemize, on your on your taxes yeah,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|you just take off your mortgage interest|sv

B|yeah,|%
B|we, uh, we lived out of state for a while and came back|sd

A|Isn't it.|aa
A|I can remember,|sd
A|I've only been here eight years,|sd
A|but I can remember coming to work from,|sd
A|I used to live in Wylie|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I could see downtown Dallas,|sd
A|and now there's this brown haze over it,|sd
A|and it's moving north.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's really it's really sad because they're not doing anything,|sv
B|well we're getting off the subject, I guess,|sv
B|but just like with housing, I mean, they're not doing anything about pollution,|sv
B|they're not doing anything about,|sv
B|it's going to look like,|sv
B|have you ever been to Houston?|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|You know, um, I used to think that Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
B|now it looks just like Houston to me.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it does.|aa
A|How long have you been in this house?|qw
B|We've been in here ten years.|sd
A|Ten years.|b^m
B|Yeah,|b

A|No,|aa
A|you really don't.|aa
A|Were, you said you were out of state for a while, was that a smaller town than Dallas area.|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|smaller,|sd
B|we were up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|sd
A|How was it|qw
B|My home town.|sd
A|how were the house prices up there?|qw
B|The prices, actually, a lot better, because Pittsburgh is about the size, I've been trying to think, like a Louisville, or Minneapolis, that type of size.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And the prices, what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five, eighty.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's really,|sd
B|and we didn't think it was that clean,|sd
B|but then after you're gone for a while, it looks cleaner, you know|sv
A|Oh, yeah|b
B|uh,|%
A|well, you know, a lot of these people that I've talked to that are coming down from, uh, like what I call, the back East especially from J C Penney, uh, are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty, hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there|sv
A|so in a way, I guess it works both ways.|sv
B|I guess it's,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|but, and here I guess it depends on what you want,|sv
B|you know, here, I got a lot of people that work for J C Penney in marketing|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and a lot of the people that came from that area, probably like what you're talking about, they had no, um, they had a lot of property but not a lot of house,|sv
B|and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it|sv
A|That's a fact,|aa
B|but, but they love it.|sv
B|I mean, they, they, they think they're getting,|sv
B|you know, you say, sun room to them, and you enclose and you can sell it|sv
A|I guess that's true.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|and a lot of them I know, a couple women that work there,|sd
B|and they don't miss, in Public Relations,|sv

A|I lived, grew up in southern Oklahoma|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, people across the street had a cellar,|sd
A|and we never did,|sd
A|and it's just like Dallas area, it was tornado alley up there,|sd
A|and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock, four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street,|sd
A|and we'd go into the cellar,|sd
A|and I to this day, I don't care if I go or not,|sd
B|Yep.|b
A|you know, if it's going to get me, it's get me.|sv
B|That's exactly, uh,|aa
B|growing,|%
B|I grew up in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh,|sd
B|and, uh, we used to call the basements actual cellars,|sd
B|so it's funny to hear that word, because I never hear it,|sd
B|you know, it's like the back porch used to be a stoop, you know|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, um, the housing is just,|sv
B|we like the older houses,|sd

B|Yeah,|ny
B|actually when we were up north, um,|sd
B|but some family things changed|sd
B|so we ended up come back down here, and all that, because it helped my husband's work,|sd
B|but, um, we really would like to,|sd
B|but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|especially when,|sv
A|with T I it's like anybody else, you never know how long you're going to be here, be in one place, you know,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's real tough,|ba
B|I mean, the economy any more,|sd

B|and she's got a, uh, a live out nanny. Um,|sd
B|but any rate, I don't have any of that, um,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people, you know.|sd
A|You basically can take care of everything yourself,|qy^d
B|We have a,|sd
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we have a dog,|sd
B|and we're pretty,|sd
B|I mean, we're not fanatically neat,|sd

A|or,|%
B|Um, no,|nn

A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, I know how to fix a running toilet|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|he does what he needs to,|sd
B|but mostly if it's something major, um, you know, cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that, we just hire out to do that,|sd
A|Sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|no thanks,|bd
B|I,|%
A|If you don't wall paper it well together, you should probably not build a house together.|sv
B|Have you ever done that,|qy
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I built three houses in my life|sd
B|And how'd that go?|qo
A|the building process was a lot of fun|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but puts a lot of strain on things.|sd
B|Getting to agree to things, I'm sure,|sd
B|and I also think that once you get to be, um, you know, certain,|sv
B|when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start, um,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|the dollar value on things I,|sv
A|You bet.|aa
B|you know, I think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic.|sv
A|Oh, you bet.|aa
B|I know I'm supposed to talk about homes,|sd

B|and you know, um, spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies, for custom drapes just doesn't|sv

A|Well, to some of them I guess it doesn't matter, you know, that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's,|%
B|I mean, and, and you know, you see a lot of these people that came east from, uh, west, from, uh, from New York with Exxon or J C Penney,|sd
B|and it's just a hoot to watch them.|sv
A|Are they, they,|qy

B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|exactly,|aa
B|so, well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house.|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|because you're uh, confined by space,|sd
A|you know, I had a,|sd
A|I came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house.|sd

B|yeah.|b
A|And I had room for everything,|sd
A|in fact I had more room than knew what to do with.|sd
A|I don't know|h

B|Well, in a way you can travel light.|sv
A|you can,|%
A|you know, you you adjust, you figure out,|sv
B|How is, how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that?|qw
A|It's not as bad as I thought it was|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's not as bad as I remembered, especially going to college and living in apartments there, you know how noisy that can be.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|I do.|aa
A|Uh, there seems to be more a mature crowd in, uh, apartments, at least where I am, uh, even though, you know, there's kids all around|sd
A|and there's, there's traffic|sd
A|and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that,|sd
A|but still, uh,|sd
B|Everybody pretty much keeps to their own turf, so to speak.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|pretty much,|sd
A|and, uh, there's never really any,|sd
A|oh I remember in school,|sd
A|there's just,|%
A|seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You don't run into that up here, I think, I think because there's so many, uh, professional people, if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they want to come home|sv
A|and they want some quiet,|sv
B|Relax and try to go to sleep,|bf

B|it's gone up, you now, maybe like five percent|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so it's an investment,|sv
B|but it's something that,|sd
B|you know, when you're first married or starting out, you think if you really have something,|sd
B|but you really,|sd
B|it's just real,|sd
B|nowadays, with the way the income tax, I think housing is strictly to itemize.|sv
A|Oh, you bet,|aa
A|and the thing that, that gets me is, uh, you never really catch up, you never really finish doing things,|sv
