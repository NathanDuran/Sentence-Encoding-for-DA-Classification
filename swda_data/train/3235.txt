A|What, what do you feel is the, the major change that's been going on?|qw
B|That's a tough question.|sv
B|We are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework. Right|sv
B|Don't ask me.|ad
A|I think that has been the major change, is that, women feel they need to go out and do this,|sv
A|they, they no longer feel it's, uh, it's no big deal to, to stay home and raise your family any more.|sv
B|Well it has no credibility any more.|sv
A|I know it,|ba
A|and I, I think, I think that's really sad, because I think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else.|sv
B|Well, I'm a school teacher,|sd
B|and I'm in charge of raising them,|sd
B|so I can appreciate it.|sd
A|You don't, well|%
A|I'm, I'm still home with, with my last one,|sd
A|and I wouldn't trade, change a minute of it for anything|sd
B|Oh, good for you,|ba
B|good for you.|ba
A|But, I, I can't, I can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again.|sv
B|Well, you know, it's interesting, because when I heard the topic, I was thinking, uh,|sv
B|this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that refused to go to work, and how their husbands thought they were terrible,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and one woman had four children,|sd
B|and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|that's,|%
B|that's frightening|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, it's sad,|ba
B|and, it, you know, it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|people were siding with the husband, saying, You've got to go to work, if you have these four children, you've got to support them,|sd
B|and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary|sv
B|That's true.|ba
A|uh, you know, to,|%
A|I, I don't think, you know, the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars, and, and, and this type of thing.|sv
A|I think that they would from the, you know, attention or whatever|sv
B|That's true.|ba
A|uh, but, it,|%
A|I, uh, I, I don't know,|h
A|I, I see it as a major problem|sv
A|and I think it's going to have to swing back the other way, because I think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, you know, I, as I said, I teach school|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, gosh, I'm trying to think,|^h
B|I don't know,|h
B|I have one woman, one mother that I know is home,|sd
B|but she also has ten children.|sd
A|What, what grade do you teach?|qw
B|Six, seven and eight.|sd
A|Six, seven and eight.|b^m
A|I've got a uh,|%
A|where do you live?|qw
A|Are you out,|qy
B|In Richardson.|sd
A|In Richardson,|b^m
A|we're in Plano here.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|I have a daughter in middle school,|sd
A|and, uh, I know there aren't very many,|sd
A|she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home,|sd
A|but do you see, um, you know, do you ever, do you ever see problems, you know, that you feel you know, that the kids are left alone too much,|qy
B|Oh, yeah.|ny
A|and,|%
B|I've got one child, um, that stays with me every day until five, because his mother doesn't come home until seven,|sd
B|and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself.|sd
A|He stays at school?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|And the school allows that?|qy
B|Well, he stays with me|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I have a tendency to work late.|sd
B|I work until six|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home|sd
A|Oh, my,|ba
B|and, you know, I have lots of kids, because they know I'm there late|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm a slow mover to say the least,|sd
B|but, um, they'll come in and say, Can I stay with you because I don't want to go home to an empty house.|sd
B|And that's frightening, because, you know, the,|sv
B|when I said I, I'm, I'm raising them, I am,|sd
B|because we're talking about boy friends|sd
B|and we're talking about what the girl said in class,|sd
B|and, you know, what's right because there's no mother at home|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No mother to talk to.|^2
B|and, um, it makes a difference,|sv
B|I,|%
B|and just the social values,|sd
A|Well, I've just,|%
A|do you, do you feel it will swing back the other way,|qy
A|or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to, uh you know, for, for more, more and more day care type situations?|qrr
B|I, I don't know.|no
B|I, I have a feeling we're going to go more and more,|sv
B|I've got a twenty-one year old female,|sd
B|and I've got twenty-two year old male child, children,|sd
B|and I listen to my daughter,|sd
B|and she's going to work,|sd
B|and she's going to buy her house,|sd
B|and she's going to get her car,|sd
B|and then she's going to have her children,|sd
B|and then when, you know, they go on one salary, will they be able to sustain what their life-style is.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they're back to work,|sd
B|and, you know, I agree with you,|sd
B|I was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and we lived without them,|sv
B|we did fine,|sv
