A|So, what kind of neat hobbies do you have?|qw
B|Well, I like gardening a lot,|sd
B|I like to be outside, um.|sd
A|I like gardening,|sd
A|I wish I had a green thumb, though.|sd
A|I've got a brown thumb.|sd
A|That's what everything turns.|sd
B|Oh is,|%
B|but, do you keep trying anyway?|qy
A|I keep trying, uh, you know,|na
A|you just can't, can't give up on it, uh,|sv
A|I, uh, I bought some, uh, plants from Michigan Bulb Company|sd
A|they send them to you all ready alive.|sd
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|I've never had any luck with their's.|sd
A|Oh really.|b
B|Right.|ny
A|I guess, I guess these are going to croak too.|sv
A|Since I've got cats, I decided to get some catnip.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Lots and lots of catnip,|sd
A|so it's, it's still green,|sd
A|and it's been two days|sd
A|so I'm encouraged|sd
B|No,|nn
B|I, I haven't had, had good luck with that company, uh,|sd
B|I think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, I've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's a, uh,|%
B|Because they,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|do you have Lowe's up there?|qy
B|Uh, well,|%
A|Its, uh,|%
A|building, uh,|%
A|or building supplies place.|qrr
B|No.|nn
A|Um, they, they also have a garden shop|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's great,|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|now our local stores don't, don't offer any guarantee.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|But some of the,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|something like that.|sd
A|Uh, I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff,|sd
A|so, I'm going to wait on those.|sd
B|Oh, they're bulbs for Spring or Fall?|qy
A|Uh, probably Spring,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't much care about things like that.|sd
A|I'll, I'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in.|sd
A|Something, something, to keep me occupied, you see.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I'll, uh, buy some plastic and make a little house|sd
A|and,|%
B|Cute.|ba
A|yeah,|b
A|and watch the cats tear it up.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I don't know that,|sd
B|do cats bother bulbs?|qy
B|I think more the mice or other rodents.|sv
A|They, they just like to get in and dig.|na
B|Oh, I see|bk
B|so if you have fresh dirt, they'll|bf
A|Oh, they love to dig.|sd
A|I had, I had some, uh,|sd
A|I don't know what kind they are,|sd
A|I've already forgotten,|sd
A|just regular old flower seeds|sd
A|and I planted them|sd
A|and I was so, I was so thrilled because they came up, I mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place.|sd
A|And then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that.|sd
B|Uh, gee.|ba
A|So, I have to hang these things high,|sd
A|so they can't get to them.|sd
A|Especially the catnip.|sd
B|How many cats do you have?|qw
A|Three.|sd
B|Oh okay.|bk
B|Actually I just, put a, uh, little fence around my yard, uh, um, which is I suppose, technically illegal,|sd
B|but I had so many groundhogs last year that I think they'll let me get by with it,|sd
B|and it, it's got this one inch mesh|sd
B|and what I've noticed it's kept the cats out|sd
B|and I love it|sd
A|Um, yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too.|sd
A|But, uh, why would it be illegal?|qw
B|Well, because we have these uh,|sd
B|I live in a townhouse|sd
B|and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.|sd
A|Oh, uh, yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|And, you know, they want, uh, privacy fences.|sv
A|Well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|Well they do walking tours too,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Um.|b
B|But at least, because I back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, I think I can probably justify it.|sv
A|Um, yeah,|b
A|an,|%
A|and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|right,|b
B|I|%
A|You know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|the first year, the deer ate my garden,|sd
B|and I was just astounded.|sd
B|I'm going deer, right here in the city|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right here, Bambi|b^m
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Uh, gosh.|ba
B|And so,|%
A|Well, let's see,|^h
A|other than gardening which I fiddle at,|sd
A|I'm not very good at,|sd
A|what else do I, mostly just computer stuff.|t1
B|Oh.|b
A|I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that.|sd
A|Uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby,|sd
A|it's a necessity.|sv
A|But, but I enjoy it.|sd
A|I like to think that I'm a very good cook.|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|Um, hobbies,|^h
A|that's about it.|sd
A|I don't have much time for hobbies, uh, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side,|sd
A|you don't have a lot of time.|sv
B|Right|aa
B|that keeps you busy.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and raising cats.|sd
B|I mean that could become a hobby.|sd
A|Well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, it just, it developed into sort of a business, uh, you know,|sd
A|we breed them and all that,|sd
A|but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money,|sd
A|it was just,|%
A|they were fun to have around|sd
A|and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an.|sd
A|And now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What kind of cats are they?|qw
A|Uh, I've got a, uh, a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|the Himie is probably the sweetest one.|sd
A|She's, she's just a little sweetheart.|sd
A|We, uh,|%
A|the, the Bombay had a litter, uh, last October|sd
A|and|%
A|I just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed.|sd
A|Only going to breed them once.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And, uh, she's not, she's not feeling too great today.|sd
B|Um, is that typical, to only breed them once?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|uh, most breeders are in it for the money,|sv
A|so they'll they'll breed them twice a year|sd
A|and I, I just think that it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of cruel.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready,|sv
A|uh, and, you're never, you're never|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too,|sv
A|and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And I just don't like that.|sd
B|So will, you, uh, breed one of the litter, then next year?|qy
A|We're, we sold all that litter,|ng
B|Oh.|b
A|um, we,|%
A|there's not that much call to, for Bombays.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, they're, they're registered|sd
A|but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|Uh, so all you can do is sell them as pet quality.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, so what you've got is a registered pet.|sd
A|And, not too many people want Bombays.|sv
A|They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Turkish Vans, if you've never seen one, I mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred.|sv
A|It's just, uh, medium size short hair cat.|sd
A|It's got,|%
A|he's mostly white with, uh, brown and black patches.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|But they have nice personalities|sd
A|and they're very inquisitive.|sd
A|Um, now the Himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times|sd
A|and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|It's just the stud fees are so much, though.|sd
A|It'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her.|sd
A|We, we want to breed her with a champion,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Right.|b
B|Now these are long haired?|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|the Persian is,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and the other two are short hairs.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh, that's nice.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|she's, uh, she's sweet.|sd
A|Going to have some nice kittens, I hope.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|She's, uh, she's,|%
A|if if you know what a Himalayan is, generally they look something like, uh,|sd
A|well they come in a lot of different colors.|sd
A|People don't realize it|sv
A|but they're sort of like, uh, Siamese in a way.|sv
A|They have the, uh, they have the gloves on the paws|sd
A|and they're, they're usually two colored.|sd
A|Uh, but this one is, uh, is|%
A|she's, predominantly, uh, black|sd
A|but she has chocolate, uh, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.|sd
B|Gee.|ba
A|And yeah,|b
A|she's, she's quite attractive looking.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Hope, hope the stud will find her attractive.|sd
B|And that she has kittens that look like her.|sd
A|And, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens.|sd
A|But we have to be careful,|sd
A|uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud.|sd
A|You can't just breed them with anything.|sv
A|We have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point Himie,|sd
A|so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|That's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with,|sd
A|can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know|sd
B|You can't just tell them that anyway,|sv
B|but|%
A|That's right.|aa
B|Oh dear.|ba
B|Well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby.|sv
A|Well actually, I mean, it, it is a business in a way,|aa
A|but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. Especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats.|sd
A|We're, we're about to get another breed,|sd
A|we're we're going to buy a Devon Rex .|sd
A|And I didn't, I don't like Devon Rexes at first.|sd
B|What is it.|qw
A|It's a, well actually it's a mutant.|sd
A|It, it comes from England and, uh, in the county of Devon.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And it's a mutant cat.|sd
A|And they're, they're pretty expensive,|sd
A|we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one.|sd
A|Um, they're very thin,|sd
A|they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And they have real short hair.|sd
A|It's curly, as a matter of fact.|sd
B|Huh, interesting.|ba
A|Um, yeah,|b
A|it, it, it's a strange looking cat.|sd
A|Uh, I didn't like them at first.|sd
A|They've got great big ears,|sd
