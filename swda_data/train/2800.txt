A|I don't,|%
A|guess we got our first, uh, credit card, oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when, I first got married|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|was a Visa card. Uh, issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|because my sister worked at the, uh, the Visa some Bank Americard center there. *one utt with a.3 utt2?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, we were still in college|sd
A|and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified.|sd
A|They've come in handy over the years.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes.|sd
B|Oh, tell me about it|ba
A|Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, staring those bills in the face|sd
A|and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff|sd
A|and it adds up.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they add up quick|sv
A|So, sometimes, uh, especially traveling with T I, you know, everything goes on American Express,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible, uh,|sd
A|I kind of like having them for, uh, gasoline purchases.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, you know.|sd
B|But,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|But other than that, uh, I, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|How, how do you look at counting credit cards?|qo
B|We just, uh, quit using them|sd
A|Well, that's,|%
B|And they got us in trouble,|sd
B|we took a loan and paid them all off.|sd
B|We keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, Visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but other than that we don't use them anymore|sd
A|Well, that's kind of the way we were doing|sd
A|it's, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing, it's just too much by the time you get,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid.|sv
B|I know,|aa
B|isn't that funny?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|And I give them,|%
A|maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid|sd
A|because they're,|%
A|know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent.|sd
A|Sometimes, it's twenty-two percent interest.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, uh, the, uh, American Express card with T I,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|there's no,|%
B|Huh?|br
A|with the American Express card from T I, there's no, um, late fee,|sd
B|Uh-huh .|b
A|there's no, uh, interest rate,|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|you you either pay the thing off|sd
A|or they come get it.|sd
A|And it's turned into personnel|sd
A|and they come get you|sd
A|So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then,  some  of the others do.|sv
B|Oh,  yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|Oh, you can?|br
A|You can use it like any other card,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, but, it, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month,|sd
B|Oh, I see, huh.|bk
A|and who knows how many people, are looking at those, uh, bills that come in, and those statements,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you're not the only one.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh, you want to make sure that, uh, is that okay,|sd
A|is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and most of the time it is.|sd
A|But, most of the others I've sent back, I mean, all you get is card offers, *two utts|sd
A|I've got three card offers now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, Visa Gold and, uh, some, other bank, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out.|sd
A|And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one,|sd
B|Oh, I do too,|aa
B|I don't even open them much,|sd
B|I throw them out.|sd
A|I don't want to have to mess with it.|sd
A|You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, one of these days it's going to all be full.|sd
B|A girlfriend of mine found a,|sd
B|it was a Visa or MasterCard,|sd
B|she found an ad for one in like a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent.|sd
A|Oh, that's not bad.|ba
B|shoot I need one of those|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|No,|^h
A|if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away. years ago, well, I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for, *sd oh, probably fifteen years,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they started charging, uh, annual membership fees,|sd
A|and I said, adios, I'm, you know, I'm not paying you,|sd
B|Why do they do that?|qw
A|It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell.|sv
B|I mean, I mean they get enough, you know, on the interest|sv
A|I mean, they've been,|%
A|Well, sure.|ba
A|And they, I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards,|sv
A|they're going to get cards at the , twenty bucks a pop.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There's going to be that much more.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, so, then a couple years ago I found, uh, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card,|sd
A|so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, I, it would be okay,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|but I can't see paying someone to use their card.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|I can't either.|aa
A|Be charged their eighteen percent interest, Yeah,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think you're right.|sv
A|The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|really.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|gets a lot of people in, in trouble|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it sure does.|aa
A|Maybe they're counting on that,|sv
A|I don't know.|h
A|Well, I guess that's it.|sd
B|Okay.|aa
A|Thanks for talking.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
