A|if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And uh, we, put, we put tung oil on it.|sd
A|Kind of made it sticky for a while.|sd
A|But after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,|sd

B|I remember it took me a long time,|sd
B|it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,|sd
B|and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.|sd
