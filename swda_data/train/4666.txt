B|Actually, I'm in,|%
B|like I said, I'm in Minneapolis|sd
B|and the big thing up here, of course, is the twins.  Uh,|sd
A|I  imagine you can't escape it|sv
B|No,|aa
B|it's, it's pretty pervasive.|sv
B|It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here.|sv
B|But, uh, actually, I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year,|qy^d
B|but that was a lot of fun .|sd
A|Well, of course, it was fun for you|sv
B|Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.|sd
B|In fact, I've only been up here a few months|sd
B|and I'm going back at the end of next month.|sd
A|To?|qw
B|Uh, Orlando, Florida.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.|sd
B|But,|%
A|I was born and raised in, uh, near Miami and, uh,  spent the  last twenty years in Dallas uh, where the Rangers played.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,  for the  last, uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A and the San Francisco Giants.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, but honestly, you know, I, uh, I do my duty and watch the sports  on, uh,  the newscasts|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I haven't followed it real closely at all. Uh, except like I said, last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that pretty religiously.|sd
B|Went out into the bars, you know drank a beer, watched the game, had a a good time that way.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
A|sure.|b
B|But, uh,|%
A|Well, I  guess the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A were like the leading teams a couple of years ago.|sv
B|Is that right?|qy
A|Well, I|%
A|well I don't know.|h
A|That's sort of what I gather.|h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, and, uh, I don't know.|h
A|What is the prognosis for, uh, this year?|qw
B|Uh, real good as far as I can tell.|sd
B|People  are pretty excited about it.|sv
A|Good.|ba
A|I, I  assume that means good for the Minnesota|qy^d
B|Well yeah|ny
B|Sorry about that,|fa
B|yeah.|%
B|Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good.|sd
B|Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago|sd
B|and they, they won that one seven to one,|sd
B|so, uh, that's pretty good I guess.|sd
B|It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.|sd
B|Are you still there?|qy
A|Yep|ny
B|Okay.|b
B|I heard some noise on the line.|qy
B|Didn't know what happened.|sd
A|I think a train went by.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|All  right.|b
A|I  know a train went by,|sd
A|I don't know what the noise was|sd
A|but I think it probably was the, the train.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I don't know.|h
A|I, I, I don't even know, uh, who has been winning in, uh, as far as the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A|sd
A|but I think they both won their opener.|sd
A|I, uh, sort of gathered that in my, uh, subliminal memory.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, uh, for their season coming up.|sv
B|I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now.|sd
B|Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, uh, an internship.|sd
B|We, we're both doctoral students|sd
B|and  he's  doing his with I B M|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.|sd
B|But, uh, I, I think he kind of follows the sports|sd
B|and I think he's mentioned uh, the Oakland A a couple of times.|sd
B|Uh  he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess they are different leagues.|sd
A|Is that right?|qy
A|The  A|qy
B|As far  as I know,|na
B|yeah.|%
A|Yeah .|b
B|And  in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions|sd
B|and then, of course, there's the minors.|sd
B|Uh, I don't know.|h
B|I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,|sd
B|and he offered, you know, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought, uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, or a row of seats actually,  for the home games.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|But the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.|sd
B|So there's no, no way that you can ever use them all.|sd
A|Eighty-six?|b^m
B|Eighty-six.|sd
B|I was amazed to hear that.|sd
A|Huh!|ba
B|You know, that's just the home games|sd
B|and I, I thought it was a mistake|sd
B|but he goes no  .|sd
A|Well they  must play every day then.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well just about,|sd
B|yeah.|%
A|I mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And that's, you know,|%
B|yeah|%
B|that's almost,|%
A|And that's,  Lord, that's, uh, over five months worth.|sd
B|That's a lot of baseball.|sd
A|Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.|sd
B|Well, you, if you, if you consider it, the season starts,|sd
B|well it's,|%
B|the season started about a week and a half ago|sd
B|and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.|sv
A|No.|ar
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I think so.|sv
B|It did last year, didn't it?|qy
B|Or was it  November?|qy
A|That  was the Super Bowl.|sd
B|Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.|sd
B|I know it was doggone cold up here. Uh,|sd
A|I don't feel so bad.|sd
A|I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball|sv
B|Well, I know  for sure it was,|sd
A|I see,|b
A|okay.|b
B|And,  and it was at least two months after I got up here.|sd
A|Oh, really,|b
A|okay  .|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so it had to be November anyway.|sd
A|Well, I, I know, uh, the Super Bowl,|sd
