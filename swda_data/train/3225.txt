A|so you're into microwave cooking.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know,|sv
B|and it's, uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave|sd
B|and it be ready in just a few minutes|sd
A|, yes,|aa
A|and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,|qy
A|something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.|sd
B|All week.|b^m
B|Well, we've done that, too.|sd
B|There's just my husband and I,|sd
B|and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot uh, pot of spaghetti|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,|sd
B|and I kind of get sick of it after he|sd
A|I know.|sd
A|I try not to make too much.|sd
A|It's just my husband and I, too|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but,|%
B|Right.|b
A|What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?|qw
B|Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas|sd
A|Oh, oh.|b
B|it's, it's really good,|sv
B|I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.|sd
A|Ooh,|ba
A|that sounds delicious.|sv
B|So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What about you?|qo
A|I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, it|%
A|you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad|sd
A|and that's about it, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, what do you put in it?|qw
A|Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts|sd
A|and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Ooh,|ba
B|that sounds good.|sv
A|and you mix it up,|sd
A|and you just put it on the top of the chicken,|sd
A|and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's delicious|sv
B|Ooh,|ba
B|that sounds good.|sv
A|and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business,|sd
A|and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's chicken's done.|sd
B|Is done,|b^m
B|right.|b
A|So that's a real easy thing for me.|sd
B|Yeah,|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.|sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,|qy^d
B|but|%
A|No,|nn
A|I don't,|sd
A|my mom gets that,|sd
A|but,|%
B|they have one,|sd
B|if you like to cook, they have,|sd
B|every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one|sd
A|Really.|b
B|and, um, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,|sd
B|but, I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake,|sd
B|and it's just a regular cheese cake,|sd
B|and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon peel and orange peel|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake,|sd
B|and it is wonderful,|sv
B|but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room temperature|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,|sd
B|but it's, it's very good.|sv
A|Well, I love cheese cake.|sd
A|I have never been, I don't know, the ones|sd
A|I have made I have not done that well with.|sd

A|I don't,|%
A|I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake.|sv
B|No|aa
B|it's not.|sv
A|And, uh, the recipes that I've used,|sd
A|everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple,|sd
A|and then I make it,|sd
A|and it's, it's really not very good|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but yours sounds good.|sd
A|I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.|sv
B|It does,|aa
B|and it, it, it is really good.|sv
A|Um. Well, that sounds interesting,|sv
A|so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.|sd

B|and then they also go into the wines, you know to serve with, you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing,|sd
A|Well, how neat.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.|sv
B|We have some friends who've done that,|sd
B|and they've really enjoyed it.|sd
A|Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.|sd
A|I guess I,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that.|sd
