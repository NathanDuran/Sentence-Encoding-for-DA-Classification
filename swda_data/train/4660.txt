A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|How do you get your news mostly?|qw
B|Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio.|sd
B|And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and  just fall off on the articles that I like.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.|sd
A|It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|It's really weird.|sv
A|Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long.|sd
A|But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news|sd
A|and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper|sd
B|Um.|%
A|Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,|sd
A|so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know.|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?|qy
A|But,|%
A|No.|nn
A|Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'|nn
A|I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock,  nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news.|sd
B|Sure.|b
B|Right.|b
A|But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,|sd
A|can you hold on just for a second?|qy
B|Sure.|na
A|Just a minute.|ad
A|answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker|fp
B|Yes.|fp
A|Yes,|fp
A|I'm sorry to keep you waiting|fa
B|Okay|bd
A|Uh, I was calling from work|sd
A|so and that was a call waiting.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do.|sv
B|Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it.|sv
B|But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news.|sd
B|Or that's what  comes on first.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|That's true too.|aa
B|And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night|sd
B|but my wife is usually up then|sd
B|and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|I, uh,|%
B|but, you know, I, I wish I had, uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction|sd
B|and, uh, there's, you know,|%
B|not that the news is science fiction,|h
B|but, uh, uh, I'm more interested in that.|sd
B|Things like, uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. Uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, you're right.|sv
A|There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, uh, especially the weather.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I like that|sd
B|Me, too.|sd
A|Although they're usually wrong|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|Georgia here, they're usually wrong too.|sv
B|We have weird weather systems.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty.|sd
A|Uh, that seems like a long time for news|sv
A|but that's how long it is.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,|%
A|And, uh,|%
B|I, I, I'm not a morning person|sd
B|so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my  morning news.|sd
B|I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work|sd
B|and then  at work  I have no time to read the news.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,|sd
A|huh-uh.|aa
B|No|b
A|But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news|sd
A|so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|It's been nice talking to you Tony.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
B|I'll probably talk to you again.|sv
B|I had a friend who was in this|sd
B|and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet.|sd
A|So, you never know,|h
A|it might this time.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
