A|Capital punishment.|sd
B|Okay,|%
B|what's your views on it?|qo
A|Um, for myself, I'm personally against it,|sd
A|but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.|sv
B|Correct.|aa
B|Okay,|%
B|well, I'm for it.|sd
B|I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.|sv
B|I, I feel like that child molestation and murder|sv
B|I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.|sv
B|I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,|sv
B|and of course Texas has it, but they very seldom, you know, put it into effect.|sd
B|So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know a lot of people on death row.|sv
A|Okay, well,|b
A|Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.|sv
B|Well, uh, yeah|b
A|Texas is a big state,|sd
B|which is not very often.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Um, here in Maryland to the capital punishment law,|%
A|people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one, no one has, actually has the sentence carried out.|sd
A|Uh, I'd certainly,|%
B|What do they do, just keep them on death row for the rest of their life.|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|I think so.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, uh,|%
A|or affair number|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,|sv
A|the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.|sv
B|Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?|qy
A|Uh, I don't know the exact numbers,|sd
A|but, but yes,|ny
A|prisons are overcrowded.|sd
B|I know that we have, you know,|sd
B|really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,|sv
B|and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,|sv
B|and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,|sv
B|and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,|sv
B|and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it|sv
A|Um.|%
B|uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.|sv
A|Okay,|b
A|you're, you're certainly in the majority uh, at least in this country.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.|sv
B|I know they use it very, um,|%
B|they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|at least not in Western Europe.|sd
A|Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.|sv
A|Um, there are many reasons for it,|sv
A|but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.|sv
B|Yes,|b
B|you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.|sv
A|Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,|sv
A|arguably, if|%
A|arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.|sv
A|Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.|sv
B|Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.|sv
A|I, I, I,|%
A|however the question is is that making the difference.|qy
B|Oh, I, I don't know.|no
B|But we have a lot of welfare programs|sv
B|and|%
A|Oh.|b
B|if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,|sv
B|you know, or is it,|%
B|in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.|sv
A|Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.|sv
B|Oh, do you?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Well, that's interesting.|ba
B|I would not have, I would not have said that.|sd
B|I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.|sv
B|That's an interesting theory.|sv
B|I'm not that familiar, you know,|sd
B|I've only been over there a couple of times|sd
B|and I'm not that familiar with, that,|sd
A|Me, too.|sd
B|all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, uh,|sd
