B|Uh, some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but,  what, what are your,|qw
B|what is,|qw
A|We do not watch a lot of T V,|sd
A|we try to watch it on Thursday nights,|sd

A|And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons.|sd
A|I was sort of sorry to see it go too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it.|sd
B|I, I really did not think it, it was,  that  way.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it presented.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I thought a lot of the,|sd
A|like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Just the dynamics of it and everything.|sd
B|Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,|sv
B|but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as,  as examples  of things that were going on|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|and, and uh, you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  that sort of thing|sd
B|Uh, we kind of,|%
B|uh, our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along,|sd
B|so, uh,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah,|aa
A|you are too tired to do anything.|bf
B|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|Probably more worthwhile.|sv
A|I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|I, I can not, uh, *typo? cannot?|sd
B|I don't think there were, Uh,|sv
B|I have not, I have not, uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to|sd
B|I, uh, you know,|%
B|I, uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch,|sd
B|but, uh, I uh, you know very seldom like to watch you know those,|sd
B|there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.|sd
B|I like, uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|it's, I  notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,|sd
B|yeah|%
B|but it's, uh, it's on|%
B|instead of being on P B S it's on regular T V.|sd
A|Oh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I have seen parts of that before,|sd
A|it is interesting.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa

B|but, uh.|%
A|Do you watch sports much on T V?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|if it's if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to be watching it|sd
B|or,  or  I am not a big basketball or baseball fan, if it, unless it's baseball, if it's some, if it's a team I really like, I may watch|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V,  for  an extended period.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's slow.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's so slow that you just get bored, you know,|bf
B|I, I will switch between something else and, and a baseball game going back and forth, you know watching it.|sd
B|But, I usually,|%
B|if, if, if it's a football team I really like, a college team or, or pro team that I am fond of, I usually will sit and watch that.|sd
B|But, uh, that's the|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we are like that|sd
A|and occasionally we will, like on, if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something,  we  will watch a little bit of a golf tournament.|sd
A|But, uh,  you  can not take a whole lot of that either,|sv
B|Yeah.|b

B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's kind of like,  like  baseball|sv

A|and,|%
B|Right.|aa
B|I think that that's what more people are doing|sv
B|and I think that's, you know,|sv
B|as, as T V,|%
B|I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do, to do that, uh, you know, get more movies and watch.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I  know we, we have done that too in the past, uh,|sd
B|we do not do it quite as much now, cause our baby will not let us watch them.|sd

B|they look,|%
B|they, every year they look at, uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, uh, the most houses will be,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  so they, uh, they look|sd
B|and they, when they, when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in, put,  some  in, or they will at,  least  consider it,|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
