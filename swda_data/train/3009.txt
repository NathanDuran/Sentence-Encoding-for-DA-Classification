A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I don't,|sd
B|You don't?|bh
A|but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
B|So. Well, I have two daughters|sd
B|and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,|sd
B|and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.|sd
B|Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.|%
B|Well, if I were|%
A|Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|I would think someone older|sd
A|and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b^m
B|And I think that varies.|sv
B|I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|that's true also.|aa
B|Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.|sd
A|I'm twenty-two now|sd
A|and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.|sd
A|But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,|sd
A|well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,|sd
A|but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.|sd
A|The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.|sd
B|Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up|sd
B|and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,|sv
B|I know I did this with my children,|sd
B|it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself|sd
B|so they, they thought, okay,|sd
B|she knows how to, how to treat children.|^q
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, see when, um, I first got my my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.|sd
A|Um, this lady saw us at church|sd
A|and she was a you know, she was a younger lady.|sd
A|She didn't really know my mom.|sd
A|She knew my mom by name|sd
A|and that was it.|sd
A|And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family|sd
A|so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,|sd
A|I thought that was pretty strange.|sd
A|You know, and she had two children.|sd
A|One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.|sd
A|So, I you know, I enjoy kids|sd
A|and I get along with them very well|sd
A|so there's no problem.|sd
A|But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.|sd
B|Oh, I agree with you,|aa
B|but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So she was going on those two instincts.|sv
B|Just the same I know myself,|sd
B|I never,|%
B|and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.|sd
A|Oh, I would be too|sd
B|And, and in it really shocked me|sd
B|because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.|sd
B|She had just moved in the neighborhood.|sd
B|She had her daughter with her,|sd
B|and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.|sd
B|And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
B|And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I mean people are so different.|sv
A|Oh, I know.|aa
A|Um, well, I I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.|qy^d
B|Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I worked just a part-time job|sd
B|and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in|sd
B|and, you know, I made a few phone calls,|sd
B|I went in and visited.|sd
B|I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, that was a concern with me.|sd
B|Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there|sv
B|and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,|sv
B|and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.|sd
B|You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well,|%
B|But I,|%
B|go ahead.|ad
A|How did you stumble upon the day-care center?|qw
A|Did you just look it up in a phone book|qy
A|or what was it?|qw
B|Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think most people do that.|sv
B|I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything|sv
B|or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care|^q
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So there, there are just so many considerations.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?|qy
B|Oh, money is always a factor in my life, definitely.|na
B|I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.|sd
B|I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,|sd
B|but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care,|%
