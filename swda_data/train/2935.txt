A|Well, what kind of garden do you have?|qw
B|Well, we've tried having,|sd
B|let me turn the T V off,|^h
B|we've tried having a vegetable garden,|sd
B|and I'm from Chicago,|sd
B|and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.|sd
B|And we have tried several years in a row,|sd
B|and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,|sd
B|and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,|sd
B|and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it,|sd
B|but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, right now we're just,|sd
A|Do you have a lawn?|qy
B|Yeah,|b
B|we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.|sd
B|We have a peach tree.|sd
B|That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply.|sd
B|But that's nice to have|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|yeah.|b
B|So what do you do up there?|qw
A|Well, um, actually it,|%
A|we've sort of had an ideal Spring.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and the roses have been blooming for two weeks,|sd
A|and the grass is, uh, this lush green,|sd
A|and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, um, you know, I just keep looking at,|sd
A|and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.|sd
B|Really.|b
B|Gosh.|ba
A|But, and my garden, you know,|%
A|my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall|sd
B|Oh, boy|ba
A|the plants and,|%
B|that sounds wonderful.|ba
A|you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know,|sd
A|we'll have a freeze.|^q
B|If you don't have a frost you'll be all right|sd
B|That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost|sd
B|and half the stuff would get frostbitten,|sd
B|and you'd have to.|sd
A|Well, that's it.|ba
A|Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January,|sd
A|and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it,|sd
A|and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something|sd
B|Wow.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, you know, everything just got hit hard|sd
B|Oh, boy,|ba
B|that's frustrating.|ba
A|So, but yeah,|%
A|it, it's interesting,|sd
A|and I enjoy gardening.|sd
A|My son does the mowing of the grass.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me|sd
A|I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.|sd
B|I love gardens that are well tended,|sd
B|and I just,|%
B|there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just|sd
B|I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,|sd
B|and just,|%
B|I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long.|sd
B|And, uh, I, I was in England once,|sd
B|and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.|sd
B|You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.|sd
B|Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old|sd
A|Oh, they help you.|sv
B|So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you|sd
A|Oh dear.|ba
A|Oh but that's nice, you know,|sv
A|I mean the peach tree is, is a start|sv
A|and,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|that's really lovely.|sd
B|I would love to have different fruit trees.|sd
B|It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.|sd
B|They're just delicious.|sd
B|And, we, we we have, still have to spray some,|sd
B|but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,|sd
B|because I just,|%
B|I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|What about tomatoes,|qo
A|aren't they pretty hardy?|qy
B|Um, we've tried them,|sd
B|but again, it's just like the sun scorch.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the|sd
B|I mean it's just,|%
B|you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and um, that's really what makes the most sense,|sv
B|because you don't have to use so much water,|sv
B|and|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it really does the job.|sv
B|But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.|sd
B|And if you're not really committed to it,|sv
B|I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,|sd
B|and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something,|sd
B|and by then it's burned up, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,|sd
B|so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that|sd
A|Well, I would assume, too,|sv
A|I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|it just gets so hot so fast here.|sd
B|We don't have really a Spring or a Fall|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it just, uh, immediately heats up.|sd
B|So, that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, um, you know, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.|sd
B|It was really nice.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.|sd
B|In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it.|sd
B|I'll never forget.|sd
B|Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.|sd
B|I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him|sd
B|They remodeled the entire back yard.|sd
B|Then they sold the house and got divorced,|sd
B|so I don't know what that says about it all|sd
A|Oh, dear.|ba
B|Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.|sd
A|Sounds like it would have been pretty.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it really was.|sd
B|I enjoyed it there.|sd
B|But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,|sd
B|because they like to see things grow.|sd
B|They've done a couple of little seed projects,|sd
B|and so I think it would be fun for them.|sd
A|Oh, sure,|ba
A|sure.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full|sv
B|Oh, yes|aa
B|They're both running around now.|sd
A|And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,|sv
A|but it's not off the list.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, it's very therapeutic,|sv
B|I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They certainly enjoy that part of it|sd
B|It's just trying to keep anything.|sd
B|I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring|sd
B|and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,|sd
B|and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?|sd
B|At least he didn't eat them,|sd
B|I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Maybe next year they'll do better.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|really.|b
B|If they survive this year.|sd
B|Oh, well, good luck to you.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|well, thanks.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
A|It was nice talking to you too.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
