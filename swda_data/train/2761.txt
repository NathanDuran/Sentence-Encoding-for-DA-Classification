A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful|qw
B|Have a big family, I guess,|sv
B|that's a start.|sv
A|Well I guess so.|aa
A|Have  you had any in the|qy
A|well how old are you?|qw
B|Twenty-five,|sd
B|so,|%
A|Okay|bk
A|so you  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.|qy^d
B|I just got married.|sd
B|Right,|na
B|every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.|sd
A|Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?|qw
B|Well, we plan on it,|arp_nd
B|it's like the third weekend in August,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|so  it's every four years|sd
B|and so,|%
A|So they all know it.|bf
B|Yeah|aa
B|and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people are from down here, in Texas.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.|sd
B|That's where I'm originally from.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.|sd
A|Well that sounds like fun,|ba
A|do they all have the small children too, that come?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|pretty much.|sd
A|So all ages.|qy^d
B|Yeah|ny
B|and, uh, you know, there's some my age|sd
B|and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.|sd
A|Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  they don't ever plan it as, like you do.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I think  if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind|sv
A|so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,  because  they're rather socially active too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.|sd
A|If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else|sd
A|and we're already locked in|^q
A|but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Therefore, they don't have many people left.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh,|sd
A|I haven't known many of those people,|sd
A|but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family|sd
A|and that's been very nice,|sd
A|with, uh,|%
A|I have one sister,  and  three brothers|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they're only three out of five of us who have children.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  they don't see each other very often,|sd
A|we don't really know many of them.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's kind of bad.|ba
A|It really is,|aa
A|they're fun,|sd
A|they're a lot of fun,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but,  uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis|sd
A|and, uh, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.|sv
B|A lot of my cousins are real close|sd
B|and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?|qy
B|Uh, no,|nn

A|it's gorgeous.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|so.|%
A|Well I,|%
A|uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now.|qw
B|Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation|sd
B|the next one was when I graduated from college,|sd
B|so I guess about two more years.|sd
A|Yes, well,|b
A|and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you|qy
B|Uh, maybe,|no
B|I don't know,|no
A|Maybe|b^m
B|two more  years,|sd
B|I don't know,|no

A|I mean you need another milestone, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I guess that's, that's what,|%
B|I mean I've been married now for about nine months|sd
