A|Why don't you tell me about your choir.|ad
B|Oh.|b
B|Okay,|aa
B|well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing|sd
B|and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. Uh,|sd
B|others have,|%
B|there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra. Uh,|sd
B|just, you know, different backgrounds.|sd
B|It's been really kind of interesting.|sd
A|Great.|ba
B|So,|%
A|Uh, I play the piano|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano.|sd
A|He does that, uh, musically, listens|sd
A|and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man.|sd
B|Oh, they did?|bh
A|Yeah,|qy
A|and that's lots of fun.|sd
B|How did, How did they get involved in that?|qw
A|Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions.|sd
A|It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so they went and tried out|sd
A|and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man|sd
A|and my son played one of the children in a band.|sd
B|Oh, how fun.|ba
A|So, yeah,|aa
A|it was really fun,|aa
A|and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school,|sd
A|and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, we just really like music.|sd
A|It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off,|sd
A|we get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.|sd
B|Um, uh-huh,|b
B|um.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|that's nice.|ba
B|You say have your four year old taking lessons already?|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?|qw
A|Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki. Which is an auditory type learning experience.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know,|sd
A|you look at the note on the page|sd
A|and you play what's on the piano,|sd
A|but he can't learn like that.|sd
A|He's a delayed child.|sd
A|He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand,|sd
A|we went, wow|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we better have him do do something. You know, educationally.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that was really fun.|sd
B|Well, because my,|%
A|My husband and  I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.|sd
B|Pardon  me?|br
A|So,  my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five|sd
A|Um.|b
B|because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much|sd
B|and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play|sd
B|and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.|sd
B|She just,|%
A|Oh, I think that's great.|sv
B|So I wasn't sure when to start her.|sd
B|I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.|sd
A|That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them|sv
A|and then they get pretty good|sv
A|and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something,|sv
A|they go, I don't want to do this anymore|sv
A|and you're like God, I really want you to do it.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know.|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,|sv
A|but, I don't know,|h
A|if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.|ad
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think she'd like to,|sd
B|I just don't know if it's really,|%
B|knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot|sd
B|and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was something easily forgotten.|sd
B|So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight|sd
B|or, or should I say seven.|sd
B|I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.|sd
B|She does have to really work at it,|sd
B|but, uh, so,|%
A|That's like me.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it,|sd
B|but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway|sd
B|but,|%
A|Well, it can get expensive|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's for sure.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|so it's been good for our family.|sd
B|Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method,|qy
B|have you had any former Suzuki students?|qy
A|I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,|ng
B|I was wondering how,|qw^d
A|Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will|sd
