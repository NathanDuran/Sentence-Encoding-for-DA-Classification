B|And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years|sd
B|and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, when they asked us did, did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, I think uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, my, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|or I think they already would have by now, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so I don't know if, if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now.|sv
B|I think they're doing the, is as much research as they can possibly do, you know.|sv

B|you know what I mean?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, that sort of thing.|%
B|Uh, if, if we were talking about the money, uh, I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough, simply because I don't know that much about it. You know|sd
