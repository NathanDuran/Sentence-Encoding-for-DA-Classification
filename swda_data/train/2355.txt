A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what do you think about the war recently?|qo
B|The war?|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|You mean in terms of the economy|qy^d
B|or,|%
A|Uh, the economy,|na
A|the,|%
A|our soldiers going over, uh,|sd
B|Oh,|b
A|just everything.|sd
B|I thought we were going to talk about social changes.|sd
B|Is that, is that what|%
B|you're kind, of directing it,|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Oh okay|bk
A|Yeah,|b
B|Okay|b
B|well Um. Well, I think it's caused a lot of, you know, big difference between when people had gone to war before, like compared to Vietnam|sv
A|that's the first thing I thought of|sd
A|I don't know.|h
A|Right.|b
B|because, I mean, I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that, you know, and support the soldiers,|sv
A|Right|b
A|and,|%
B|so.|%
A|I know that, uh, I've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two|sd
A|you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but then in Vietnam that was totally different, you know,|sv
A|you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|And now, if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a, a good candidate. exactly, exactly.|sv
B|yeah.|b
B|Yes,|aa
B|it would be like a bonus for your, image or something.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|it,|%
B|I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income, just drastically altered.|sv
A|Oh, torn apart.|^2
A|Oh,|%
B|We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a, just had a new baby,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, they would have, she would have had to go back to work|sd
B|and, I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|So it,|%
A|that's also a good reason why it, it,|sv
A|or good that it ended as soon as it did.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|I think the biggest change that we've seen, um, in, in my life or whatever lately is the economy,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and things are so tight,|sv
B|and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years|sd
B|and, you know.|%
A|Exactly,|ba
A|and it seems like everything is raising, everything that can be, cigarettes, not that I smoke, but cigarettes, um, uh, stamps,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean it seems like|sv
B|Even dog licenses|sv
B|I mean,|%
A|Exactly,|aa
A|everything single thing that we do, is higher,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know. And they just raised the minimum wage today|sd
A|but that's not like, you know, as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.|sv
B|Going to effect too many,|^2
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|So, that's the hardest thing for us|sd
B|and, um, we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home.|sd
B|We have a three year old and a two year old|sd
B|and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but, you know, every week it gets harder|sd
B|because I could go out and be making money,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|you know, so that's a big, uh, stress I think, you know, for the social changes in our family.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I don't, I don't have any children or anything right now|sd
A|I'm, uh, I work as a news reporter in Waco,|sd
B|Oh,|b
A|and so,|%
B|I see.|b
A|I get to see,|sd
A|I got to see a lot of not firsthand but, uh, probably a good part of the war, um, as far as what people thought about it, and a lot of things like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Well|%
A|It was kind of amazing|sd
A|people were coming to me to ask me, you know, what's going on, you know, like I knew, or like I sat in on the meetings or something.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you have an inside track or something.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|So, I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about, you know, changes in, in the war and everything,|sd
A|so that was pretty interesting.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Let's see,|^h
B|what other social changes in the past ten years, oh,|t1
B|I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes, in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be, everything, superperson|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Exactly,|aa
A|be everything, be supermom,|^2
B|Yeah,|b
B|because I know, you know, I, I really get pressure from, because I have a career also,|sd
B|and I get a lot of pressure from people that, you know, my colleagues|sd
B|that|%
B|why am I staying home. You know,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|And,|%
B|whereas before that never would have happened|sv
A|Whereas it would have been,|sv
B|people would have said, why are you going to work.|sv
A|Exactly, um.|aa
B|So, that's kind of a difference for us.|sv
B|I think there's more pressure to, um, not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|So he's,|%
A|The roles are changing a lot.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|he's gotten a lot, uh, you know,|sd
B|you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,|sv
B|but in terms of his amount of hours at work, nothing on that has lightened up.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer|sd
B|and,|%
A|And even, you know, I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of, kind of play a good part in our changes|sv
A|because, you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true,|ba
A|And I think, you know that,|sv
B|MISTER MOM|sd
B|and,|%
A|yeah,|b
A|and then you have the women, uh, detectives now and, you know, different roles,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|just in what we see|%
A|and so we probably want to do that even more now. You know since the women's movement in the, seventies,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|That's true.|ba
A|and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still a, still have a good ways to go.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So,|%
B|I think there's still,|%
B|I, I know that, um, I grew up in Chicago in the sixties,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and was part,|%
B|my family was real liberal,|sd
B|and I think there's a lot of, um, kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society, and race relations and things like that,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's kind of more covert now.|sv
B|People used to be more clear and say, you know, well, I believe in this or I believe in that,|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
B|and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice,|sv
A|It's just not as,|%
B|but people think, oh, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
A|But it's,|%
A|I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go, still,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize a lot, the plight of a lot of people. You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you,  but there's so many more people,  and that you don't even see or know about.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|But there's so many more people,  that are homeless|^2
B|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community,|sv
A|Oh, oh, yeah.|ba
B|you know, because when I was growing up in Chicago, um, we were in a real ethnic neighborhood|sd
B|and there were people from all, first generation Chinese, German, you know all different nationalities, and everything.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And now we're kind of like in Lewisville, Miss White Little suburbia, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean I don't even know anybody that you know , from any place other than Texas hardly, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I grew up in, in Brooklyn, New York,|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|and so I was just, I was just surrounded, you know, by Black people,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because I'm Black,|sd
A|and so, you know I lived, that's where I lived.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so now, I, I feel lucky actually because I've almost lived around everyone.|sd
A|I've, I went to U T to college,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and so they, you know, they have a lot of different people go there, different kinds of people.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know, some people have lived in Lewisville all their life,  you know,   and so they don't get to see,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and they,   they think the whole world,  is like that.|sv
A|Exactly And|ba
B|We lived in a dorm.|sd
B|My husband and I met in graduate school, at Indiana University|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I was, ours was, uh, international you know, co-ed dorm,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and there were twelve hundred students,|sd
B|they're graduate students from all over the world.|sd
B|And once we came here it was like,|sd
B|gosh,|^h
B|I just miss that,|sd
A|Exactly.|ba
B|because it really is exciting, to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds.|sv
A|It is.|aa
B|We got invited to,|sd
B|one guy practically roasted a goat in his, in his dorm|sd
A|Oh, my God.|ba
B|I wonder if he was from, Iran, or some place,|sd
B|I don't know where|h
A|Well, there's so many people who have never, you know, even gotten to do that,|sd
A|so that's great.|sv
B|yeah.|b
A|My sister was telling me she met a she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in, in Philadelphia,|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, she just met a girl from, um, I think, Barbados or Jamaica, or something, like that.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And I mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time, and everything|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|and, she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars.|sd
B|yeah.|b
A|So my sister had to take her shopping and, you know, show her what to wear, show her how to match up colors|sd
A|and, I just thought that was so very exciting, you know, to go and, and just witness, you know, this girl just coming to America type thing, you know.|sd
B|Oh, God.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|really|b
A|So, you know, I would have loved it, the opportunity to do that,|sd
B|That is part, of the change I think that I've seen probably, you know, in the past twenty years or whatever, is now kids have to have so much.|sd
A|but,|%
B|I mean I even get caught up in it with our kids, even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, people you know think they're kids have to have five, hundred dollars worth of toys.|sv

B|Oh, gosh.|ba
A|and I couldn't, and I just couldn't you know,|sd
A|I was from New York and so, you know, we road the bus.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|me too,|sd
A|And if you had a|%
B|in Chicago I didn't even date a guy that had a car until I was in college|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Exactly.|aa
A|And if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway|sd
A|or, you know, it's just,|%
A|you just didn't have a car,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools|sd
A|and I couldn't understand it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, all the kids had cars,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they, you know, have to have a car.|sd
B|Oh, gosh,|ba
A|So that was,|sd
B|my kids are going to be hating me,|sd
B|I'll give them a bike and say, here's it|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|so you can afford to pay the insurance, you know|^q
A|Really.|b
A|Or live really close to school and have them walk.|sd
