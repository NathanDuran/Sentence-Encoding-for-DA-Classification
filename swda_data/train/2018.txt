B|Hello.|fp
A|Hello,|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|Hello|fp
A|this is Lois.|fp
B|Hi,|fp
B|hi,|fp
B|this is Lisa.|fp
A|And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I got a call yesterday too.|sd
B|This is a different subject though.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|this is about changes in the women in the,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.|qy
B|Yeah|ny
A|I think there really is.|sv
B|It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.|sv
A|Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.|qy
B|Yeah, uh,|ny
B|I think you have to push one|ad
B|and then we can start recording it.|ad
A|Okay|aa
A|All right.|aa
B|Okay.|b
A|Are you ready now?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay,|b
A|like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess,|sd
B|she's in her late forties.|sd
B|You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids|sd
B|and I've never faced that at all.|sd
A|Uh, no,|aa
A|I think now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you stay there.|sv
A|And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|uh-huh,|aa
B|I think it's definitely gotten better.|sv
A|Oh, I do to, much.|aa
A|And it's just going to get better.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It really is.|sv
B|Because women are in every field now,|sd
B|I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in.|sd
A|Oh, I can't either, not a one.|sd
B|And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|even in Washington, you know, there seems to be a lot more women involved.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue,|sv
B|I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|I think that would be the best goal.|sv
A|Oh, I do too,|aa
A|just your qualifications|bf
A|and that would be it.|bf
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|exactly,|aa
B|not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or female.|sv
B|That would be wonderful,|sv
B|I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, huh|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, you know,|sv
B|Exactly,|aa
B|or the way you look,|sv
B|or the way you, you know,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|your age or anything.|sv
B|I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.|sv
A|I do to|aa
A|just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that, you know, that you have.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|and then,|%
A|And then if you get it, you know then,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.|sd
B|Is it.|bh
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|it sure is.|sd
B|That would be great.|sv
A|It sure is.|aa
B|Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house|sd
B|and she, you know, we could send her messages,|sd
B|and, and she kept in touch like that, and basically, just worked out of her house.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I would just take her the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two,|sd
B|and that worked out great too.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|that is.|sv
B|And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|All it was, was, you know,|sd
B|I mean, she just used a phone modem|sd
B|and she was like she was sitting in the office,|sd
B|so I think that's real nice too, to come up with different options.|sv
B|Do you like the job sharing?|qy
A|Oh, I do,|na
B|Do you?|bh
A|I really do,|sd
A|I think it's great.|sd
B|Do you work like half days, or half weeks or,|qy
A|Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two|sd
A|and she'll work two,|sd
B|Oh, oh that's great,|ba
A|and we just share off like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you get the full benefits?|qy
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|yeah|ny
A|we get the full benefits.|sd
B|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
A|But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|especially with children, and so many things going on, that would be great.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|It really is,|sd
A|and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you know, of children,|sd
B|Either way,|^2
A|uh-huh.|%
B|yeah,|aa
B|you have your career and your home life,|bf
B|and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children.|sv
A|Oh, it is,|sd
A|it is,|sd
A|well both of ours is school age,|sd
A|but we don't want to miss any of those P T A and, you know, all of that.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|oh, no,|aa
B|I think,|%
B|yeah.|%
B|My son's just in day-care|sd
B|but even that they have extracurricular activities|sd
B|and the older they get the more that you're involved in that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think it's great,|sv
A|I really,|%
B|Yeah,|b
A|and I look for more of that in the next generation.|sd
B|I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on those decision making,|sd
B|you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,|sd
B|that would be wonderful.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|oh, I do too.|sd
B|Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything,|sv
B|so you don't have to, you know, unless you're just really sick, or the child's sick.|sv
A|Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend,|sd
A|or just forget it.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|oh yeah,|b
B|I have to plan way in advance, because,|sd
B|or, what I've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's been real helpful too,|sd
B|like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening.|sd
B|So that's real helpful,|sd
B|so you don't, you know, have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.|sd
B|I don't know how many times I've done that to do something, post office or the bank or any kind of errand,|sd
A|To do,|b^m
A|yeah.|b
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just,|sd
B|it's always been that way.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I know,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I can remember back growing up, my mother,|sd
A|I mean it was|%
A|she always worked,|sd
A|but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.|sd
B|Oh no,|aa
B|I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,|sd
B|and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did.|sd
A|Oh yeah.|aa
B|I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job,|sd
B|I think men get paid more,|sd
A|Oh, I do too.|aa
B|but I think that's improving.|sv
B|It's such a slow process|sv
B|it's frustrating,|sv
B|but, you can see that it's wrong|sv
A|Yes,|b
A|yes.|b
B|and you just want to make it right,|sv
B|but at least the wheels are moving forward.|sv
A|They really are.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think it's getting better, not worse.|sv
B|Well, I should probably get back to my job|fc
A|I know,|fc
A|I know the feeling.|fc
B|Call again.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|I sure will.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fc
B|bye-bye.|fc
