A|the one will take,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|uh, okay,|b
A|let's see,|^h
A|I guess, uh, I can start.|sd
A|I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing.|sd
B|Are you really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have.|sd
A|We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon.|sd
A|So,  I'm looking for something, uh, littler  bigger,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|which are both kind of small.|bf
A|yeah.|aa
A|Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while|sd
A|and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Are you looking for an American car|qy
B|or, you open to buying foreign cars?|qrr
A|Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's, you know, it,|%
A|I guess the American cars had a bad reputation|sd
A|but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,|sd
B|and I really like it a lot.|sd
B|Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,|sd
B|but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,|sd
B|but I would also look at American cars,|sd
B|but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also|sd
B|and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean, even if it's just details, it seems like, uh they, you know,|sv
B|So, if I were,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I|%
A|there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal|sd
A|and you have to take it back every once in a while.|sd
A|It's clearly just a, a design problem there.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|it is.|aa
B|Uh, I'm kind of,|%
B|right now,|%
B|the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car.|sd
B|I would really like to have a sports car.|sd
B|Uh I don't really, I don't have a family,|sd
B|so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,|sd
A|Oh, like a Miata or something like that?|qy^d
B|Well, I like the Miata,|^h
B|but I don't like it enough to buy it.|ng
B|I would buy something,|sd
B|actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|But, uh, something along that lines.|sd
B|Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,|sd
B|but uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|interesting.|ba
A|Yeah,|%
A|I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Probably,|%
B|Right.|b
A|Uh,|%
B|That's,|%
B|when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage,|sd
B|and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So,|%
A|Yeah|b
A|I I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and  things like that.  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|but it, you know depends on what you, what you pay initially.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's, you know,|%
A|we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,|sd
A|but uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, But, uh,|%
B|Okay.|b
B|Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think,|sd
B|and, and they were okay.|sv
B|I had a Pontiac once|sd
B|and, and I never had a problem with it,|sd
B|but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point|sd
B|and I, I had driven it a few times|sd
B|and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge just from,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car.|sv
A|That's interesting.|ba
A|But,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|it, it's hard to beat some of the,|sv
A|uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction,|sd
A|but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,|sd
B|Which is a good deal.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|because I guess, uh,|%
A|I mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|so all the depreciation has been taken off|sd
A|and, the dealer comes out okay you know,|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|that,|%
A|don't what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it,|sd
A|but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it|sv
A|and So, but, uh, I don't know,|h
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I'm sure they did.|sv
A|we keep looking at that mini van.|sd
A|It's just, you know,|%
A|we can get a, like a Caravan for, twelve, five|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.|sd
A|But, uh, uh, it's interesting,|sv
A|but, uh, I don't know,|h
A|if, if, uh, it seems to be,|sv
