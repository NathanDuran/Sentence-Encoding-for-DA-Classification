A|Maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.|sv
B|I think so.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|and a lot,|sd
B|I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.|sv

A|Right.|b
B|and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Just wasn't socially acceptable.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know,|sv
A|and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS|sv
A|and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,|sd
B|well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know|sd
A|right.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|It wasn't that long that I was that young.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I've got a ten year old,|sd
B|and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms,|sd
B|and and he knows about AIDS,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality.|sv
A|Now it's we're protecting our lives.|sv
A|It's a it's a much different,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we have, you know,|%
A|you can't just, just hope for abstinence.|sv

B|I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.|sv
B|I mean that's, sex is rampant,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it always will be,|sv
B|and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|They, they,|%
B|that just does not go.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it, it's interesting, listening to them.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|Yeah,|%
A|I, I, I imagine you're right.|sv
