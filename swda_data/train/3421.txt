A|So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile?|qw
B|Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY.|sd
B|Have you seen that yet?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I, I saw the previews.|sd
B|It's really good.|sv
B|I loved it.|sd
B|Um, it's, um.|%
A|Does, does he, does it have a happy ending,|qy
A|or.|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|really good ending|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.|sd
B|I generally don't get into movies that much,|sd
B|but I saw that one,|sd
B|and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF.|sd
A|Oh, that was funny, wasn't it|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|did you, have you seen that one?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it|qy
A|Yes.|aa
B|But it was silly.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|So, now these are for two very different movies.|sd
A|One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.|sd
A|Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.|sd
A|I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's been out for a couple of years,|sd
A|but. Have you seen that?|qy
B|I haven't seen that yet.|ng
A|Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play,|sd
A|and it's beautifully done.|sv
A|Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit|sd
A|and there might be a word or two changed.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie|sv
B|Um. Such as|br
A|um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies,|sd
A|and I also like just some strange movies.|sd
A|Do you have any.|qy
A|Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER.|sd
A|Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS.|sd
A|That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
B|I haven't seen any of those.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend,|sd
B|They're really good?|qy^d
A|I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing,|sv
A|you have to like,|sv
A|did you see TWIN PEAKS?|qy
B|Huh-uh,|nn
B|no.|nn
A|No,|b
A|so, okay.|%
A|So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're, they're just strange.|sv
B|Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense|qy
A|Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word.|sv
B|or,|%
A|Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric|sv
A|and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.|sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|That was the television show.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies.|sd
A|Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY.|sd
A|Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um,|sd
A|what, what are the titles,|t1
A|I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters.|sv
A|Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|So do you like, um, movies a lot?|qy
B|See I don't do,|sd
B|I don't.|sd
A|I do, I do like movies a lot.|na
B|Right.|bk
B|See, I don't do that,|sd
B|I don't go to movies that often,|sd
B|but, just recently I've been to a couple|sd
A|Do, do you rent them,|qy
A|or.|%
B|Um, no,|nn
B|we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|but, I don't know,|h
B|I just, I usually fall asleep|sd
B|or I get bored pretty easily|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's what my wife does too, um,|sd
A|I mean, she falls asleep|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|b
B|that's exactly right.|ba
A|Well, well it was good talking to you.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|it's good to talk to you, too.|fc
