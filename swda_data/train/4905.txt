A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, I just currently quit my job|sd
A|and so I really don't receive any benefits right now|sd
B|Right|b
A|But my husband does|sd
A|and, uh, I think one of the, uh, my,|sd
A|first of all, always salary and|sd
A|the second thing is, uh, because we have children,|sd
A|so it would be, uh, health benefits and medical benefits|sd
A|and and, uh, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Definitely.|aa
A|We have with Aetna|sd
A|and, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with them|sd
A|but we're real happy with them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field.|sd
B|And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits.|sd
B|Uh, I've worked for, for for awhile|sd
B|and they are, you know, a really academic type of place.|sd
B|And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. And then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff.|sd
B|So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid|sd
B|and, you know, some have like bonuses|sd
B|and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits|sd
B|and so, yeah, I would|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids.|sv
B|Uh and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know. When we, when I think about changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of health care they have|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially|sd
B|or how does that work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big  one for me.  Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh,  cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any  and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|so that's not so bad, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.|sv
B|want to just, you know, all your salary can't even  begin  to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know in a major illness or something. Uh.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that really helped us out a great deal.|sd
A|So.|%
A|But my husband does get vacation|sd
A|and it's worked out really good for us too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So|%
A|But.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, cause that makes a big difference.|sv
B|My wife works part-time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends|sd
B|and so two days a week, I, uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus|sd
B|So she you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon til close.|sd
B|Uh, so we have|sd
A|Well,  that's great that you all can work that out.|ba
A|That's really good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and being  on a, you know, rigid schedule wouldn't, there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school|sd
B|and you get home|sd
B|and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know.|sd
B|And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know.|sd
B|It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if, as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do .|sd
A|Worked out really well for us too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh. Well is there anything else that you look for|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh,  a lot of I guess is.|sd
A|You've hit pretty,|sv
A|you've put a lot of the main points in.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I think some of, is how the, uh, you know,|sv
B|I guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Cause I've been, uh,|%
B|especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems I've found out.|sd
B|I've worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, you know, type companies. And it, and especially if you're doing like professional work. Where you know, it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|If you're,|%
B|like I've,|%
B|I work with, uh, computer systems a lot.|sd
B|So it's kind of hard to say, you know.|sd
B|If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today|sd
B|and they were all straight|^q
B|and your building didn't fall down, you know|^q
B|Yeah,|^q
B|you did a great job.|^q
B|But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers,  you know.  Or do design studies or something.|qh
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's real hard to rate something like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.|sd
B|It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know|qh
B|How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever|qh
A|Yeah.|aa
A|And that does make a a person want to stay|sv
