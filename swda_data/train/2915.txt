A|Well, I think we pay too much in taxes.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|How about you?|qo
B|Well, I think they waste what we pay.|sv
A|Excuse me?|br
B|I think they waste what, all the money that we pay|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's what I think too.|sd
A|I don't know how you feel, um,|h
A|we moved here from another state.|sd
A|We lived here before, went out and came back,|sd
A|and that particular state had an occupational income tax, but no sales tax.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what you find out is, there's, one evil is the same as the other.|sv
A|Here you don't, there's no occupational tax|sd
A|but it's a heavy sales tax.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So they get you coming and going.|sv
B|Now it's even, it's even higher in Dallas County,|sd
B|so.|%
B|Was it.  *listen|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it's really,  I know, it's just, um.|%
B|It's eight and a quarter I think.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it is.|sd
A|I was shocked.|sd
A|I went,|sd
A|we bought a new washer|sd
A|and the man said, and that's eight percent.|sd
A|I said, eight percent. What|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it's really kind of sad,|sv
A|yeah.|%
A|And then I don't know how, you know, in terms of when you all do your federal,|h
A|but it just seems like, if you're strictly middle income, it seems like you get hit the worst.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Is that what you think?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|because it's, at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent|sd
B|and then the people that make, you know, five hundred thousand dollars and, and, and higher than that, they don't have to pay,|sd
B|and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes.|sd
A|Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|it isn't.|sd
A|Because they have the money to shelter things|sd
A|and, I don't know, somehow get a, huh|%
B|What?|br
A|Oh, I thought you were going to say something.|qy^d
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|They somehow seem to get around these,|sd
A|the things that we can't, you know,|%
A|that make, don't make that kind of money.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I don't know.|h
B|I mean, if they're in business, and, and they're making money,|sd
B|I could see if they're losing money,|sd
B|but they're making money|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|then they should pay taxes then.|sv
A|I know,|aa
A|and just somehow it doesn't seem, you know,|sv
A|and then, I, you|%
A|mean you look at like, uh, that country singer, uh, what's his name, Willie Nelson.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Some, he didn't look that stupid.|^q
A|Why didn't he pay his taxes? You know. *listen|^q
B|Right.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, uh, filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So. Do you file federal or joint income tax, And do you feel like you get hit by, you know, too much?|qy
B|I just file federal income tax every year.|sd
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I just got divorced,|sd
B|so I'm single again.|sd
B|So, and you know, it's, it's a lot worse for single people, because they pay the same amount as, as the people that make the same amount of money and  they're married.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we, right now, we don't own any property.|sd
A|We lease.|sd
A|So we're in the same,|sd
A|we don't have children,|sd
A|so we're in the same kind of,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's not as bad as being single and divorced,|sv
A|but it's sort of like, if you have like X point five children and earn, you know, you kind of get hit with, you know,|sv
A|I, I mean, it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage, because,|sv
A|doesn't that sound stupid.|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|But, I mean, there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full time compared to what my husband does, you know. *are the final "you knows" tags?|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So it's kind of hard.|sd
B|Whoever works less, they can get a tax credit for that.|sd
A|Excuse me.|br
B|If both of the, both of the spouses work, then you get a tax credit for that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|otherwise you're just, you know,|b
A|and if you have kids, you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something|sd
B|Well, it's two thousand now.|sd
A|Oh, it is.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|for everybody.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well that's not too bad.|sv
B|Then you get a, you get a child care exemption,|sd
B|but it's not enough, you know.|sv
B|I mean, you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and they only give you like, I think it's about five or ten percent of that.|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|You know, it doesn't even, it's not even,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I guess that's my call.|sd
A|I guess I better go|fc
B|Oh,  okay.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|well it was nice talking to you.|fc
B|Nice talking to  you.|fc
A|Uh-huh,|fc
A|bye-bye.|fc
