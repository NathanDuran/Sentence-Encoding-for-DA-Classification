A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,  uh, I, it's, it, I don't know|h
B|I got two numbers today,|sd
B|actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it's about sixteen hundred square feet,  which  is fine for the two of us.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|But it, it, you know, we looked at a lot of houses that were, had more square footage,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but  they didn't use it right, you know.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|It was  a bunch of empty, you know, hallway and stuff that|sd
A|that could have been used as|^2
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|really.|aa
B|So we've used every bit of it|sd
B|and our house, um, we bought it for sixty-four,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and,  uh, the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy-five,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so,  you know, I think we were you know, got a good deal on it.|sd
A|So that looks good when you all get ready to sell, you'll probably do really well.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|My father used to live in Dallas, uh,|sd
A|now, he, he went back to New Jersey,|sd
A|we're originally from the East.|sd
A|But he,|%
B|Oh really,|b
B|my husband's from New Jersey|sd
A|oh, really,|b
A|he, uh, well actually right now  he lives in Rhode Island,|sd
A|he lived in New Jersey for a while, now he's in Rhode Island.|sd
A|And, uh, he used to like to go,|sd
A|and we used to go, just every weekend just to look at houses, for no reason, we weren't buying one every weekend, but just to look at them.|sd
A|And so I got a pretty good feel of, you know, what I want when I do, you know, get my house, whenever that is, um.|sd
A|What was I going to say about that,|t1
A|I completely lost my train of thought. Um,|sd
A|but we, we enjoy going looking at houses|sd
A|and, and, uh, we now,|sd
A|I kind of have a good idea of what I want.|sd
A|I know I want a big family area,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's what we were looking for the first thing.|sd
A|uh, yeah,|b
A|fire, a fireplace,|sd
A|I saw this awesome house the other weekend,|sd
A|it was a great big family room|sd
A|and it was circular|sd
A|and the other side was the patio and the backyard,|sd
A|and it had a built in, uh, grill|sd
A|and every,|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|I  mean, it was, it was just, an the ultimate party room, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I was  just going I could have a party in here.|sd
A|But that's pretty nice.|sd
B|But that's what we had, uh, uh,|sd
B|that's what we had looked for, was our main concern was a big living room,  you  know, and big closet space, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|I like a lot of closet space,|sd
A|I don't like because,|sd
A|I don't like to have a lot of things out, you know, just all over the place,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I like  to have them kind of tucked away.|sd
B|And, uh, so that's, that's what we went for first|sd
B|and, and it, you know, we, we don't, we just have a big living room|sd
B|an, and a dining room is separate,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,  you know, some places have,|sd
B|like the house next door to us that we looked at,  had  a living room, a dining room and a den.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|But  to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, we opted for the just, the whole wide room,  that  went from one end of the house to the other, just about.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|My father had, uh,|sd
A|I keep talking about my father because he owned a house,|sd
A|uh, he had the kitchen, kind of a kitchen and a very long family room,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|it's  just kind of one room|sd
A|and what he did, he put, uh, a bar right in the center,  and  put some, uh, a glass rack down, so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and it just kind of, it kind of separated it.|sd
A|It was still, you know, together,|sd
A|but it just looked a lot better.|sd
A|Because I personally don't like the combination rooms.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|I, but I, I think for where we are,  um,  I think we got a real good deal on it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we, you know, we have a,|sd
B|uh, the backyard is just huge.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It is just really,|sd
B|I think another house could fit back there.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I'd like a big backyard.|sd
B|And, uh, we really liked it,|sd
B|of course, when you have to mow it  You know in,  uh, middle of August, it's, it's kind of,  a little hot,|sd
A|Oh really.|b
A|A little hot.|^2
B|yeah.|aa
A|Try to do it early in the mornings.|ad
B|But, uh, it's, it's nice|sd
B|and that was,  you know, a big selling point too,|sd
B|and I think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And  they've lived there and have it all built up, you know,|sd
B|they've got a whole garden and trees and everything|sd
B|so it's not like, we're, uh,  kind  of secluded, you know,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|we  don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours.  You know, right up  to our bathroom window or whatever it is.  Like a  lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well that's good.|ba
