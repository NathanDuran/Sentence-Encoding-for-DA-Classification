B|There we go.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Well, actually I'm a, I'm a Dodgers fan from way back.|sd
A|Oh|%
B|Um,|%
A|how way back, I mean|qw
B|Like, um, late fifties, early sixties.|sd
A|Okay|bk
A|so Wally Moon moon shots and all that.|sd
B|What's that?|br
A|Yeah,|b
A|coliseum, Wally Moon and all that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Okay,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|it's a, um,|%
A|I, I'm living in, just west of Baltimore, and Frederick, um, which is also just west of Baltimore, has a minor league team.|sd
A|And, uh, and, Wally Moon is the manager of them.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|so he's still kicking around.|sd
B|That's interesting.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I also lived eight years in Ohio before going to, uh, going away to college,|sd
B|and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens.|sd
A|Oh, I saw them,|sd
A|um, um, I was out there last Summer,|sd
A|and I saw a game at Ned Skelton.|sd
A|Is that the stadium?|qy
B|Uh, I couldn't tell you for sure.|no
B|It's been a long time.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|So, um, there used to be a, uh, race track.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it was,|%
A|that was impression I got when I was there|sd
A|so,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think that's right.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|so had a lot of fun|sd
A|actually, I mean, I like minor league baseball, a lot.|sd
A|It's cheaper for one thing|sd
B|Well, that's true.|ba
B|I think, I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here.|sd
B|Uh, they've led the American league in batting, fielding and pitching,|sd
B|but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any, any given year.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Yes|aa
A|I think they're in for a odd year this year,|sd
A|actually, um, they, um,|%
A|I don't understand why Encovilla got released.|sd
B|I don't either.|aa
B|I mean, the guy's twenty, twenty-five home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some R B I-s.|sd
A|I mean, he, you know, he can't field|sd
A|and, you know, he strikes out a lot,|sd
A|but, I mean, he's done that for five years.|sd
A|Why get rid of him now?|bh
B|Really, I mean, he really has become a, a very decent fielder.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|aa
A|Okay.|b
B|He's not a, the liability that he was, that he used to be.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|Um.|%
A|Oh, he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, I mean with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder, you know,|sd
B|if he strikes out a lot, so what.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I mean, with Detroit, I mean, they can get away with one guy like that.|sd
A|I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know, which they did.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yep.|b
A|So.|%
B|Well, I think the key for, for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back.|sd
A|I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter.|sd
B|It may be.|b
A|I, I like them a lot.|sd
A|I think they're going to go all the way.|sd
A|Um, and, and, I mean, by saying I like them, I like their chances.|sd
A|I, I actually don't like the Dodgers,|sd
A|I'm a Giants fan from way back.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|Well, picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|but Butler didn't hurt either.|sd
A|Uh, and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt|sd
A|and,|%
B|Uh, who's the last one.|br
A|Bobby Ojeda.|sd
A|They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Um, he's a, a pretty decent pitcher.|sd
A|He's,|%
B|Yes he is.|aa
A|Okay,|b
A|you know, he .|%
B|Yes.|b
A|And, uh, that guy , the short stop, is going to be good.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um.|%
B|Well it should be an interesting year.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I'm looking,|%
A|I've already been to one game,|sd
A|and I should have been to two|sd
A|but,|%
B|Are you an Orioles fan?|qy
A|Um, the, the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox, mostly die,|ng
A|but, um, I go to the Orioles since they're here,|sd
A|and I, you know, I do enjoy them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, I've had an opening day on Monday.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you know, I kind of wish that they had inter league play, like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while.|sd
A|How far is Houston?|qw
B|Uh, three hundred miles.|sd
A|Oh, okay,|bk
A|keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it is, it's incredible.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, um,|%
A|you know, we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia.|sd
B|There you go.|ba
A|And, um, saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before.|sd
B|Boy, you are a baseball fan, aren't you.|qy
A|Okay,|b
A|uh, yeah|%
B|Interesting.|ba
A|Um, I try to see whatever I can.|sd
A|I mean, I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|hope I'm going to do it this year because, um, uh, having a kid this fall,|sd
A|so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games.|sd
B|All right.|ba
