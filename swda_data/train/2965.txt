A|Hi,|fp
A|my last, uh, auto repair was my, my, uh, alternator went out.|sd
A|I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, uh,|sd
A|it's a little Tercel|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And, uh, I have a a friend who's real good with, uh, repairing cars|sd
A|so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and, uh, you know, get a replacement part.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we went to a, uh, a, a place called Quality Auto Parts|sd
A|an, and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and, and everything|sd
A|and they're, they're, uh, very reasonable.|sv
A|So, uh, I bought the alternator,|sd
A|we put it on the car|sd
A|and it, it didn't work,|sd
A|and it blew out all the fuses.|sd
B|Oh, no|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|How much was the alternator?|qw
A|Uh, I something like sixty-nine dollars, something on that order.|sd
B|Did he, did he hook up the wiring wrong?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|he hooked it up right.|sd
A|It, it was just that the, the part just, just didn't fit the car,|sd
A|so. I took it back|sd
A|and, uh, he, he took the the guy in, in the parts shop took the alternator|sd
A|and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them|sd
A|and, uh, he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator|sd
A|so we, we went back and tried it again, put it on again|sd
A|and it still didn't work,|sd
A|and we took the car up to, um, a little place called Pep Boys,|sd
A|I don't know if you have them in your area|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|but, uh, they're, they're pretty reasonable, uh, car repair place also.|sv
A|So, uh, took it up there, towed it up there because it, you know, wouldn't start or anything|sd
A|and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and, uh, took them about an, an hour to, um, figure out what was, what was blowing the fuse,|sd
A|and it was, it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse.|sd
A|Anyway, ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer|sd
A|and the only problem was that, uh, it had to be a genuine Toyota, uh, alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it, that, that, you know, they sit in there and everything|sd
A|but there's just some little difference that, um, causes it not to work an|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|they probably built that in so they could make money.|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|I guess so|aa
A|and that was my, that was my last experience.|sd
B|Well I had a weird,|sd
B|there's a little sensing device, uh, in front of my, uh, um, I'm not sure, right in front of the fan,|sd
B|it's a, it's an air conditioner sensing device.|sd
B|I don't know why,|sd
B|it actually,|sd
B|there's a metal piece that fits through the belts, uh,|sd
B|and somehow that broke off|sd
B|and, uh, I, I still can't figure out how it broke,|sd
B|and, uh, anyway, so this piece obviously, um,|sd
B|I have a Subaru,|sd
B|and, uh, I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer, etcetera,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks|sd
A|Goodness,|ba
A|are you able,|%
B|And, and I haven't had too many problems with my car,|sd
B|I got a eighty-eight Subaru, G L X T|sd
B|and it,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, and then, you know just basic maintenance and oil changes|sd
B|an I, and I do not do my oil changes|sd
B|and I will not do my oil changes.|sd
B|I've, I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up, um, trying to uh,|sd
B|borrowed somebody else's jack|sd
B|and I did this|sd
B|and I went and bought everything,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so after buying the filter and all the oil, you're looking at ten bucks at least, or somewhere in there an, and, uh, and then to go to the trouble, that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So that, that's, um, you know,|%
B|as far as any maintenance on my car, I, I shy away from the oil changes,|sd
B|that's for sure.|ba
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well my car is, uh, it's an eighty-six|sd
A|and I really hadn't had any, any trouble with it until that|sd
A|and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it|sd
A|and, uh, and this was just recent,|sd
A|so I really can't complain about this one.|sd
B|How did you put that many miles on it, in, four or five years?|qw
A|Um, well, I used, I used to work, uh,|sd
A|it was a seventy mile trip everyday, you know, two ways was seventy miles.|sd
B|Oh, a hundred and forty mile trip?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it was, it was just seventy miles.|sd
B|Oh, thirty-five miles each way.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
A|And, uh, I did that for about three years|sd
A|and it really, it really added up.|sd
A|I've only taken, uh, maybe two trips that were about four hours long uh, down to Shreveport.|sd
A|And, uh, the rest of it was, you know, it's just basically driving a long ways to work.|sd
A|And now I drive like twenty, twenty-three miles each way,|sd
A|so, I'm getting a little, a little, uh, little relief,|sd
A|but still I drive a long ways.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I guess because they're highway miles, you know, it's not so bad on your car as, as if it, you know, were just regular street, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you work for T I?|qy
A|Yes|ny
A|I do.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|Do you?|qy
B|I was going to ask you, you know, as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now, um,|qw
B|I don't work for T I|ng
B|and I'm just, I get these green,|sd
B|I don't know what you want to call them, fake point things,|sd
A|Points.|^2
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I just wondering how I go about getting the cash|qw^d
A|Uh, there's a number that you call,|sd
A|it's the same number that you, that you call to make a call.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|You, you call that number|ad
A|and, and, uh, somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message|sd
A|and you can leave a message.|ad
B|Okay.|aa
A|I know someone that did that,|sd
A|you leave a message|ad
A|and they'll, they'll call you back.|sd
B|Okay,|aa
B|all right,|aa
B|well that's good to know.|ba
B|I haven't been doing|sd
B|this is the first time I've been called in a long time|sd
B|and I haven't been doing it|sd
B|so,|%
A|Oh really.|b
B|And, uh, I've done it maybe twelve times.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much,|sd
B|but, uh, mine is mixed up too,|sd
B|I have to call and get it fixed|sd
A|Uh, let's see before I had this car I had a, um, I bought an Audi five thousand|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I bought it, I bought it used.|sd
A|I, I just bought it from a friend who was going to, who just charged me what the dealer was going to give, give him for it for a trade-in,|sd
A|and, uh, it had a whole lot of miles on it.|sd
A|I, I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it,|sd
A|an I, an I did get a couple of good years out of it|sd
A|and the, uh, the engine messed up on me|sd
A|and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the for the Audi dealer|sd
A|and, uh, he took the engine apart|sd
A|and, you know, he just said he couldn't fix it|sd
A|so the engine never got put back together again.|sd
B|Huh, oh well.|b
A|I,|%
B|I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|I think those old cars might, might be a pretty good bet because you|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|and, Oh, that's when they made cars, though,|sv
A|I don't know,|h
B|this things was, the body was in good condition|sd
B|and you know, it ran fine.|sd
B|It was starting to burn some oil.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um. Uh-huh,|b
B|And, um, but I had to you know,|%
B|you know, I, after about couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car|sd
B|so.|%
A|I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well, you know, these, these cars made in the sixties and stuff,|sv
B|I mean the steel, I mean, the thickness,|sv
B|I mean, those they're just,|sv
B|you just don't see cars like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they last a long time.|sv
B|And they were simple too,|sv
B|the engines were simple and durable|sv
B|and some people will still buy them, you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|they'll,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's easy to, it's easy, I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars, engines and transmissions|sv
A|and if you, I guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time.|sv
A|Course I guess I could do the same thing with the, the Toyota that I have,|sv
A|I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to,|sd
B|It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it,|sv
B|you're just better off buying another car.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess so,|aa
A|but I just think they cost too much in the, in the first place, now a days.|sv
