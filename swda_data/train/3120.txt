B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay|b
B|Well, did you go to college?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I did.|sd
B|And where did you go?|qw
A|I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students.|sd
A|I had gone to a small school growing up, uh,|sd
A|and a lot of my friends went to University of Michigan|sd
A|but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, uh, were looking for a southern school and, uh, also U of M seemed overwhelming in size|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, what about you?|qo
B|I went to the University of Minnesota.|sd
A|Oh, so you're from the Midwest, too.|bf
B|I am,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|Where do you live now?|qw
A|Uh, I live in Texas now.|sd
A|Where are you?|qw
B|Well, I'm in Texas.|sd
B|I'm in Austin.|sd
A|Oh, uh, my brother's in Austin.|sd
A|Uh, he lives Lakeway.|sd
A|He, uh, had moved, uh,|sd
A|we're in Plano.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,|%
B|I'm familiar with Plano.|sd
B|I visited once or twice.|sd
A|Oh, Austin is so pretty.|sv
A|I really like it|sd
B|Oh, I love it.|sd
B|I love it.|sd
B|I really do.|sd
A|And your daughter is going to be a sophomore.|bf
B|That's correct.|aa
B|I have two daughters,|sd
B|but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore.|sd
A|Is, uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas?|qy
B|She has her heart set on U T.|na
B|And, uh, you know, having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what a big university is like.|sd
B|And, uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I thought might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved in band,|sd
B|and Baylor has a band camp.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So she went for a week,|sd
B|and it was overnight,|sd
B|and they lived in the dorms.|sd
B|And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like on a a smaller college campus.|sd
B|And, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school.|sd
B|So, uh, I, I, I still think the exposure was good.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, well, you know,|sd
B|what were your selection criteria.|qw
B|Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford|qy
B|or, you know, there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider.|sd
A|Uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south|sd
A|and because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I,|sd
A|when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.|sd
B|Oh, definitely.|aa
A|And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology|sd
A|and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year|sd
B|Oh, how exciting.|ba
A|and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing|sd
A|and I ended up majoring in French.|sd
A|One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department.|sd
A|They also had a strong language department|sd
A|and I'd always loved working with children.|sd
A|Uh, and I found that I couldn't fit everything in,|sd
A|but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and so that was some of,|sd
B|Oh, that was, That worked out very well for you.|bf
A|but|%
A|several of the things you mentioned were the things that, uh, our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M.|sd
A|He, but he thinks he wants to be a writer|sd
A|and I don't think that,|sd
B|Well, then he should come to U T.|sv
A|Yes|b
A|Uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and so he's used to a bigger size|sd
B|Large classes.|bf
A|and because my brother is there, uh, he would have family, close by.|sd
A|So there, there are advantages. Uh,|sd
A|but I also,|%
A|because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan, which was so large|sd
A|and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.|sd
B|Oh, I went from a large high school to a large university|sd
B|and I definitely felt like I was a number.|sd
A|You still,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, I mean, it is a different feeling.|sd
B|But that was, that was my only option.|sd
B|I, I mean, I just really couldn't look at anything else.|sd
B|That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a you know, a junior college, which I didn't want to do.|sd
B|So that's how, you know, my decision was made.|sd
B|But, uh,|%
A|Well, that's certainly,|%
A|uh, especially today with the cost of college.|sd
A|I mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration|sv
A|and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools.|sd
A|And even though Baylor, uh,|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends who have children there who just love it.|sd
A|And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are|sd
A|and it is a smaller size|sd
A|and, uh, I do feel like there are a lot of options.|sd
A|It's, it's,|%
A|but I had been hoping some schools I know give, uh, oh,|sd
A|even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, uh,|sd
B|What, what does,|qw
B|he hopes to be a writer.|qy^d
A|Yes,|ny
A|he thinks that's what he'd like to do,|sd
A|but he's really strong in math and science, too,|sd
A|and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|Does your daughter know what she'd like to do?|qy
B|Oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in all directions.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is|sd
B|okay Bethany, let's be real|^q
B|Uh, she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point.|sd
B|And, I don't know,|h
B|she's taken a lot of French,|sd
B|and she may end up doing something with that.|sd
B|And I am a single mom,|sd
B|so I've been,|sd
B|and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married.|sd
B|So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.|sd
B|And I'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money. You know.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|By all means, go get that piece of paper, you know.|^q
B|Do you just have one son?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|I see.|bk
B|Well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants to do.|sv
A|Well, he, but he has even,|sd
A|now that he's in high school, uh,|sd
A|and, of course, there's, there is still time,|sd
A|but he's beginning to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.|sd
A|You know, it's, the, it's,|%
