B|I think I get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio,|sd
B|and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention.|sd
A|Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion.|sd
A|I, I, I'm from New York originally|sd
A|and now that I live in Florida,|sd
A|I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES.|sv
A|I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger,|sd
A|and I try|%
A|now that it has a national edition, I read that.|sd
A|I also read, uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and  I guess I'm ,|%
B|I like them|sd
B|but they take so long.|sv
B|I don't always have time|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, there|%
A|, it's a whole hour show.|sd
A|Actually, it's an hour show each evening,|sd
A|and, and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner.|sd
A|We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I find that I'm leaning on, uh,|sd
A|I travel a great deal, uh, even overseas,|sd
A|and I find that I lean on, uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff.|sd
A|And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out.|sd
A|I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say,|sd
A|but it's, it's coverage, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think C N N does a pretty good job.|sv
B|I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they seemed to have the best coverage.|sv
B|They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks.|sv
A|Uh.|b
A|Well, yeah,|aa
A|I, I, I, uh,|%
A|Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, uh, Iraq.|sd
A|I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know.|sv
B|Well, uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted,|sv
B|but I think they said that frequently  enough.   That, uh, you  shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective.|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|, oh, yeah,|b
A|I mean, uh.|%
A|No.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|That, that's right, I think so.|aa
A|And, and I guess when it comes to, um, to magazines, I don't read,|sd
A|I used to when I was younger,|sd
A|I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.|sd
A|I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper|sd
A|or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|which sort of gives you a different slant, than,|sd
A|it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, that I guess, and the radio.|%
A|Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot|sd
A|and I also listen to, uh, these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving.|sd
A|I,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|Do you read,|qy
A|are you from Southern or Northern California?|qy
B|Northern.|sd
B|I'm from, uh, the peninsula,|sd
A|So well,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|is that, what is that,|qw
B|Palo Alto.|sd
A|the San Francisco paper out there is, uh,  the major paper?|qy
B|Well,|%
B|it's horrible.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and that's a terrible paper.|ba
B|The San Francisco  paper is just wretched.|sv
B|So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS.|sd
A|Is that pretty good?|qy
B|Palo Alto is  about midway between.|^h
B|Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco  paper|arp_nd
B|and,|%
A|Oh the, what is that,  the CHRONICLE isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER,|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|but they're, uh, both run by the same|sd
A|Oh yeah,|b
A|they they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read.|sd
A|I, uh, uh,|%
B|They're just horrid|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|so we read,|%
A|Well, can you get the L A paper up there?|qy
A|That's a pretty decent paper isn't it|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, we can,|na
B|but I don't like it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and uh,  MERCURY NEWS.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well that's  another one I read,|sd
A|I forgot that.|sd
A|I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL,|sd
A|not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer|sd
A|but,|%
B|Yes,|b
B|well again, I read that, uh, two  columns on the front.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I think I, I agree with  you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff.|aa
A|I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I spend a lot of time reading about these things.|sd
A|I'm quite interested.|sd
A|I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today.|sd
B|Yes|aa
B|and I think we do get pretty good coverage.|sv
B|I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, uh, the news coverage.|sv
A|If anything, they, I  think they|sv
B|We almost have  too much.|sv
A|Well, I don't know,|h
A|I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and and taking their word for it, or their comment,|sd
A|actually, they, I think they slant things|sv
A|but,|%
B|Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.|sd
B|I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston.|sd
A|No kidding!|ba
A|Oh, wow!|ba
B|And I hated him then.|sd
A|I didn't know that.|sd
A|Yeah?|bh
B|And I would not watch that man for money.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|was,  was he,|%
B|So I  watch Peter Jennings, and, uh and Tom Brokaw.  Sort of alternately.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|How do you feel  about it?|qo
A|I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to,|sd
A|I don't know|h
A|if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.|sd
B|Do we get enough news or something like  that?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|To,|%
B|Do we get, uh do we get the news that we want?|qy
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I do.|sv
B|I really think.|sv
