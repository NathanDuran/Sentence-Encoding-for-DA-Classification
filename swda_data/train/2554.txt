A|Well, what do you think about it?|qo
B|Well, um, most of the stuff up until now, in the recent months, I, I, I don't have any problem with.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|I don't either.|sd
B|Uh, I mean it's,|%
B|you know it,|%
A|I don't think it's going to change very much|sv
A|but|%
B|No,|aa
B|I agree with that. As, as far as the, as far as the mess that's developing as a result, um, you know,|aa
B|as a country, the United States, uh,|sv
B|I think our hands are tied as far as, as, as any further involvement,  until  the U N sanctions it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|In fact, it really was to begin with.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I just, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, uh, you know, it, it gets to a point where, uh, if enough people are, are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the, the internal problems, um, somebody may step in again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I really think it's, it's a U N issue,  at  that point because it is internal.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in, in Iraq, they're going crazy.|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right  .|aa
A|You know,  I mean you can't please them one way or the other.|sv
B|Absolutely right.|aa
A|You know, and I,  and I think that, I, I agree with you,|aa
A|this is exactly the right course.|sv
A|I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq.|sv
A|It has nothing to do with us.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Um,|%
B|I mean these, these types of internal things go on  all over the world all the time.|sv
A|All the time.|aa
A|I mean, yeah,|aa
A|I mean,|%
B|Some of them have been going on for, for tens of years,  if,  if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it's going to continue.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|As long as you have so many diverse groups that are, that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's  absolutely right.|aa
A|I mean the Kurds  have tried it before.|sv
A|They've gotten their butts kicked,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and  this is just another time that it's happening.|sv
B|That's, that's absolutely right.|aa
A|You know, they'll regroup out in the mountains|sv
A|and they'll try it again in a couple of years.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it was just, you know, it was,|%
B|it's a very opportune moment for them to try.|sv
B|You know you,|%
A|Sure,|aa
A|and, and,  and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. You know.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I,|%
A|that would have been stupid,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,  and I don't think we did it.|sv
A|Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right.|sv
A|I don't think they would have done that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|But it just, it, it really doesn't make any difference.|sv
A|This is just a, a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and, you know, and it, there are many of them.|sv
B|There's no  doubt about it.|sv
A|Oh, sure,|aa
A|I mean the,  the British occupied the place,|sd
A|the French occupied it,|sd
A|we've done it.|sd
A|It, it's happened so many times,|sv
A|this is, this is really nothing special. Uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human  rights or anything like that.|sv
B|It,   It's, it's religious  based|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|it's   it's mostly religious anyway.|^2
B|and, uh, you know, by, by self-proclamation this is a holy war|sv
B|and it is right.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then, uh,  we, we go on from there|sv
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|it, it's, it's a mess.|sv
B|It, it's,|%
B|there's no doubt about it,|sv
B|and, uh,|%
A|Well, I,  I, I think one of the big problems,|sv
A|I mean looking at it from the the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|They don't understand what,|sv
A|I mean their politics really isn't politics.|sv
A|It's religion couched as politics.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
A|And there's  a big difference.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|You know, uh, we sit there|sv
A|and, and we think that they think the way we think.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's a big mistake,  because they  don't.|sv
B|You bet.|ba
B|You bet.|ba
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|because there's no, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's a complete different set of values.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um,  there's, there's different value placed on human life,  and,  uh, right down the list, you know, possessions and, and everything else.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh,  what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.|sv
A|That's, that's it a lot of the time.|aa
A|I, I was stationed in, in Turkey for, for a year and a half.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|And it, it was tough,  understanding  those folks.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, it, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's just, it was very strange.|sd
B|I believe it.|ba
A|It was very interesting.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I can, I can, I can believe that.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
A|Now I,|%
A|shoot,  I, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't, don't have a clue  sometimes.|sv
B|That's probably true,|aa
B|that's probably true.|aa
A|You know they,  they sit there and, and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well,  I'm not real sure that's, that's appropriate.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|no,|aa
B|that's, that's, uh,|%
B|a, a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field.|sv
A|No.|aa
B|But, uh,|%
A|Well, I sort,|%
A|that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country, too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we make experts by reading books.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You know, and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|absolutely,|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh, I, I guess you work for T I.|qy^d
B|That's right, yes.|ny
A|So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else.|qy^d
B|Right,|na
B|right,|na
B|that's an everyday occurrence.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's, it's like our car industry,|sv
A|the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese, you know, came into it and helped,  us  out.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I agree.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's, uh, there, there is, there is, it's an overall problem in, in, in this country understanding, uh, foreign cultures,  or  even accepting them.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, it, it, it bites us over and over|sv
B|again, the,  the, the,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and  until we, until we start changing our educational system, I mean we're, we're going to be,|sv
A|we're, we've already been overtaken,|sv
A|but it's going to get even worse later.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean looks  who's, looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|It's not  us.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You know, we, we've got folks running around here who get, who get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology,  or  some, some ridiculous stuff  like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|And, and where are the engineers coming from?|qh
B|Uh, well, they're, they're coming from various places,|sv
B|and a lot of them are going back there.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|That's|%
A|My, uh, my roommate is a, uh,|sd
A|he's getting his doctorate in industrial,|sd
A|well, it's not industrial engineering,|sd
A|it's human factors.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|His degree was in, uh, industrial engineering.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|Uh, and he's from the Philippines.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|okay.|b
A|You know, uh, but I, I see it all too often.|sd
A|I mean we've got loads of foreign students|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they're coming here, going after the hard degrees|sv
A|and then they're going back to Korea and Japan,  and  Hong Kong and everywhere else|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|and they're applying it there.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|And I don't know,|h
A|it's, to me it's amazing.|sv
A|I don't know what we're going to do as a country.|sd
A|We're, we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you know, every, every,|%
B|the, the country's got a problem with, uh, with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And  the long, long-range views are, are just kind of, become a thing of the past.|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|you,|%
B|And, uh,|%
A|I don't, I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.|sv
A|I think it, it's, it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, it, oh, here's a crisis.|sv
A|Well, let's plug it up.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|I don't know.|h
A|I don't know what the answer is.|sd
A|It's far beyond me.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's for sure.|ba
B|That's, that's the way things have gotten.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|all we can do is keep plugging.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I, I wonder,|sd
A|I, I read in the paper just last week, I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, at a price tag of six thousand bucks, I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|absolutely.|aa
A|now I have the I have the I B M, P S two|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|but I'm sorry I got it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's slow,|sd
A|it's, uh, there are many better machines on the market right now for a,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Okay.|b
A|and I saved forty-eight percent,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so  I said, yeah, if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount, I'll take it.|sd
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|But up to that point I had I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|But|%
B|That's absolutely right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|now you watch,|ad
A|just sure as anything, the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the, the,|%
B|unfortunately the way the, the way the high tech market goes, by the time you can get, get something in your hands,|sv

B|That's right.|aa
A|at an opportune time I got one that, that suited my needs|sd

B|Okay,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And that's all I plan to do.|sd
A|Of course, I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line.|sd
A|I got the model twenty-five.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|So I'm stuck with six forty,|sd
