B|when I bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said, no, no, you're crazy to buy a mobile home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But now it seems that, uh, with the local economy bad and T I|sv
B|and strange it seems that, uh,|sv
A|It wasn't such a bad idea?|^2
B|Oh, they're doing some back pedaling.|sv
A|So, have you got, uh, land?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I'm renting at the time,|sd
B|so.|%
A|I did that one year,|sd
A|I lived with two other girls|sd
A|and we all taught.|sd
A|And it was a two bedroom,|sd
A|so, we took turns, you know, having, sharing the bedroom.|sd
B|Gosh.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|I got to where I decided I wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom.|sd
A|And then we had two baths|sd
A|it was just, one, the little bathroom, were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in.|sd
B|Well, mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one.|sv
A|That was in the seventies.|sd
B|Ours is wood ours is wood sided,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it has a traditional V top , roof,|sd

A|well, I bet it's not bad.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere,|sd
B|and, uh, you know, so, it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be.|sd

B|Fifteen.|sd
A|Oh, so, it was still a lot cheaper,|sv

A|and we bought one of the cheapest houses, you know, a tract house.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|oh, yes.|b
B|A mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper,|sd
A|Which probably didn't make much difference.|qy^d
B|it did.|sd
A|have a in it.|qy
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|no|nn
B|what I meant, not in quality,|sd
B|what I meant was, four years equity costs five hundred dollars.|sd

A|So, if the economy gets better, are you going to get another one, another house?|qy
B|I, don't know.|h
A|No?|^g

B|You know, it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else, somewhere else is easy.|sv
A|But you wouldn't take that mobile home,|sd
A|right?|^g
B|Sure.|na
A|You would?|qy^d
B|Sure,|na
B|absolutely.|na
A|It would be cheaper to move that than buy another one.|qy^d
B|Oh, absolutely.|na
B|When I, you know, when you talk about the deal like I got, yeah, yeah, it would be cheaper.|sd
B|Uh, especially if it were a paid move or something.|sd
B|You know, there's some paid moves occasionally.|sd
A|T I would pay to move you?|qy
B|I don't know|h
B|but they did,|sd
B|when I, when I moved up here,|sd
B|so, they might want to move away.|sd
A|So, how many years you been up there?|qw
B|Uh, six or seven.|sd
