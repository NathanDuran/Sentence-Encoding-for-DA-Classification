B|Do, do you have kids you take to movies|qy
B|or,|%
A|No,|nn
A|no kids.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It's a Walt Disney movie|sd
B|and it didn't get as, you know, as good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID, their last one, and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year.|sd
B|But this one was, I thought was excellent.|sd
B|The ,|%
A|Was that the animated version?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it's animated.|sd
B|And I can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now.|sd
B|It's just, just the special effects, you know.|sd
B|And in this movie, this, there's this boy|sd
B|and he rescues this, uh, bald eagle|sd
B|and, uh, and it's a huge eagle, you know, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.|sd
B|And the boy actually rides on his back|sd
B|and he rides through the clouds, you know,|sd
B|and you see him coming out of the clouds, his head coming out and then the bird coming out,|sd
B|and it, you know, they're flying all over with it.|sd
B|And I mean, I know they, there must have used, been computers or something for animation this day,|sd
B|but it was just so real, realistic and lifelike and good animation.|sd
B|It was a good show.|sd
A|Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation?|qy
B|Well, ROGER was a composite one.|arp_nd
A|Yeah .|b
B|There's one, there's a movie I've seen, ROGER RABBIT.|sd
B|That's not a recent movie,|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|that was made in a few, I don't know, several years back, I guess.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Latest, latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART,|sd
A|had Claude Van Damme.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He was, he's of course, uh, I guess he's trained in this, uh, martial arts of some sort,|sd
A|but the plot was bland,|sd
A|the acting was bland.|sd
A|It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to|sd
B|Chop them up, huh?|^2
A|yeah,|aa
A|chop them up,|b^m
A|exactly.|aa
A|And,|%
B|This is supposed to be the, the guy that's, uh, replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or, or the next Chuck Norris type of guy.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Or he's singular I guess, you know.|sd
A|You know how they can make any of, any single one of them in a movie to be a super superstar of any sort, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Superstar.|^2
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but Chuck Norris, of course, could be just about equal, if not more|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or, and all of them, I guess, could be in that fashion, or category.|sv
B|Hum.|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|It was about, uh, a, French Foreign Legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who got, who became a widow because he was selling drugs|sd
B|.|%
A|and he got killed.|sd
B|Really uplifting, huh|qy
A|So he deserts and goes to New York|sd
A|and he starts out by fighting to make money,|sd
A|and then he moves on to L A to where that, where she is to just help him out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was really, I mean the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something.|sv
A|I don't know|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|I haven't heard, I hadn't heard much about that movie.|sd
B|I,|%
B|other than it was a chop them up movie.|sd
B|But, uh, well, I guess that's one I won't go see|sd
A|Well, it was worth the buck I guess.|sd

B|Have you seen that one yet?|qy
A|Yeah.|b
B|What, what, what,|%
A|I, I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting.|sd
A|Uh, I guess what made it so good was the cinematography,|sd
B|The, the wide open, the spaces,|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and the music|sd
A|and, uh, well, it had an excellent story line.|sd
A|Everything about it was good.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I thought an excellent one, too, was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan.|sd
A|I'm not a James Caan fan,|sd
A|but that was a well directed and acted movie.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|I'd recommend it.|sd
A|It's a little on the violent side|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but then what movie isn't anymore.|qh
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|Yeah,|%
B|our movies today, it used to be X|sd
B|and, you know, and P G used to be R|sd
B|and, seems like the rating system, you know, is kind of switching that way a little bit|sv
A|Well, I have no objections to it.|sd
A|It's just, uh,|%
A|and it's a matter of your taste, uh,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It's just that,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|it's just that the rating system seems, you know, instead of having X now, they have what, N C seventeen?|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|They just changed it because X had a connotation with it, you know,|sv
B|so,|%
A|And even on those type they don't show what you expect.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|A lot of those are really violent type movies.|sv
A|Right.|b

B|Yeah,|aa
B|I read the book before|sd
B|so I knew the story line going in,|sd
B|but they changed some things in the movie.|sd
B|It wasn't the same.|sd
B|I thought the book was better than the movie,|sd
B|but I thought the movie was really good as well.|sd
A|I always wait for the movie.|sd
A|I don't have time to read the book.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I don't,|sd
B|I read about one or two thick novels like that a year. You know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that's about all the time I can, I can spare.|sd
B|But that was a good show I thought, you know.|sd
B|I read about how they did, uh, an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine.|sd
B|You know, that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water.|sd
B|It was, it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|All those underwater scenes.|sd
B|I thought, you know,|%
B|it looked to me like it was a real submarine, that was in the water, you know.|sd
A|They ,|%
A|That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I hear this movie F X part two coming out is, uh, pretty good.|sd

A|oh, I'm not sure.|h
A|I can't remember.|h
A|It's been a while since I've seen it.|sd
A|But he, he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody|sd
A|and he has to go underground,|sd
A|and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done.|sd
B|Hm.|%
A|And, uh,|%
B|To, to fool people|bf
B|and ,|%
A|Right,|aa
A|and using makeup and using the all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go.|sd
B|All the tricks.|^2
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That sounds like an interesting concept.|sv
A|But you need to rent the first one first.|ad
B|To understand what's going on in the second?|qy^d
A|Uh, if, if that is that the second one follows the first.|sd
A|I don't know if they have the, uh, original actors on that first one to that one.|sd
