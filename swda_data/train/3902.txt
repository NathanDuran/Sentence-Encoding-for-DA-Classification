A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you,|ad
B|Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I do.|sd
B|Do you?|bh
B|I have a grandmother.|sd
B|She's a hundred and two.|sd
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|She'll be a hundred and three in August.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.|sd
B|She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town|sd
B|and then my sister takes care of her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|She still has her snap.|sd
B|She takes care of her own business.|sd
B|This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker,|sd
B|but with somebody that needs around the clock care,|sd
B|I have seen my family age.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I have seen them in the,|sd
B|she's been there ten years now.|sd
B|And I have seen them age twenty in the time and, and with the expense and everything,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I I still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home|sv
B|and they needed some quality care,|sd
B|I would put someone in a nursing home.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|My mother-in-law finally.|sd
A|They had to make a family decision.|sd
A|There's seven children in my husband's family|sd
A|and fortunately four of them live in the same home town|sd
A|and she has Alzheimer's.|sd
A|It was getting where she was getting dangerous. I mean letting strangers in and things like this,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they were very fortunate.|sv
A|It's a small town|sd
A|and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers|sd
A|and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time|sd
B|Oh, well that's good.|ba
A|but she really doesn't.|sd
A|Nobody thought she would adjust,|sd
A|but she has adjusted beautifully.|sd
B|Oh, that is great.|ba
A|But then I am also facing my father who is very sick|sd
A|and my mother and father reside in Colorado.|sd
A|She's been taking care of him.|sd
A|I don't know how much longer this can last|sd
A|and at that point because he requires round the clock.|sd
A|He can't do anything without her.|sd
A|He doesn't know when to take his medicine|sd
A|and it's really sad|sv
A|and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,|sd
A|my brothers are not interested in helping me|sd
A|so I would have to move him down here.|sd
A|That way,|%
A|I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one.|sd
A|You know, where I can go see it.|sd
A|I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.|sd
A|And,|%
B|Oh, why  yeah.|b
B|I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh,|sd
A|like they have apartment styles,|sd
A|but that wouldn't work for him.|sd
A|I think he is beyond that.|sv
A|Where if you need help you can get it,|sd
A|but basically people kind of have a small apartment|sd
A|and doctors are available if they need them.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I  know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin.|sd
A|And allows,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.|sv
A|Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is|sv
A|but,|%
B|And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|It, it takes every penny.|sv
B|They want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And that's the sad part about it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|and I think a lot of people who do it now.|sv
A|In Colorado it's interesting.|sv
A|I talked to my mother.|sd
A|They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.|sd
A|And my mother could make it on that.|sd
A|What she probably would do is disburse the money to me|sd
A|and then I would send it back to her|sd
A|so that's what would happen.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think that's what most people do.|sv
B|You just have to give it, everything away.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It's  unfortunate.|sv
B|I, I  work at a brokerage firm|sd
B|and I have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's frightening.|sv
A|And I guess, uh, I don't know how old you are.|sd
A|I'm forty-six.|sd
A|You know, we're the generation moving into this|sd
A|and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. You know.|sd
B|I can't imagine.|ba
B|I'm twenty-nine.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And everybody in my family has always had,|sd
B|we don't have any children.|sd
B|Everybody that has, has them later in life.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties.|sd
B|So, I mean, they're not that far away.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise|sv
A|and he's still living at home|sd
A|and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.|sd
B|Oh, I know.|b
A|And so, it's kind of,|%
A|you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,|sv
A|but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older.|sv
A|Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.|sd
A|But  you see these people in their seventies|sd
B|It,|%
B|but yeah.|b
B|Most people aren't.|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|most aren't.|sv
A|That's the problem.|sv
B|And that's the bad thing.|sv
B|I would hate to have lived so long.|sd
B|She lived by herself.|sd
B|My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one. And just did everything,|sd
A|That's incredible.|ba
