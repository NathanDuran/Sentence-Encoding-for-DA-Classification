A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?|qw
B|Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.|sd
B|I have a set amount that I, that I save.|sd
B|Actually, well actually there is a, a way,|sd
B|budget our money apparently.|sd
B|The,|%
B|uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks|sd
B|and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that|sd
B|and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I am single,|sd
A|so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  I basically,|%
B|Really don't  need to.|^2
A|Right,|aa
A|I don't need to.|b^m
A|I am the only that I have to keep track of|sd
A|so it makes it a little bit easier.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are|sd
A|and I am pretty consistent from month to month|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,|sd
B|I am in my fifties now,|sd
B|but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,|sd
B|I had four kids|sd
B|and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.|sd
B|Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.|sd
B|Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.|sd
B|For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.|sd
B|Every six months I have to pay car insurance.|sd
B|Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.|sd
B|So I take a set amount.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in|sd
B|and I also have got a checking account besides that,|sd
B|but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out|sd
B|and I put it in parenthesis.|sd
B|I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.|sd
B|Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I guess that's a way of budgeting.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's,|%
A|I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.|sd
A|I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.|sd
A|Like I am,|%
A|probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind|sd
A|and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, you know, we've got two cars.|sd
B|My wife has a car|sd
B|and I like to drive pick up truck.|sd
B|So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.|sd
B|And you know I am constantly making car payments,|sd
B|but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, you know, I get one paid for|sd
B|and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides|sd
B|so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,|sd
A|Huh. Right.|b
B|but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Have you thought about, uh, leasing?|qy
B|Well, uh, I have thought about it,|na
B|but leasing wouldn't,|sd
B|you know, I don't use it for my business.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|My wife uses hers just for pleasure|sd
B|and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so.|%
A|But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I guess.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you're right.|aa
B|Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,|sd
B|but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill|sd
B|and you got to put put stuff in them you know.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|Yeah,|%
A|mine's, uh, seven years old|sd
A|and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.|sd
A|I had a number of expenses|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,|sd
A|uh, you know the,|%
A|as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.|sd
A|So, I just went through that whole set last year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again|sd
B|Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.|sv
B|Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|What line of work are you in?|qw
