A|Uh, Kate, what kind of, uh, where do you like to eat out?|qw
B|Well, we, uh, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and, uh, so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out,|sd
B|and so, uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, uh, restaurant there,|sd
B|and I think they have one of the best services that, uh, that we really like it.|sd
A|Do you?|bh
A|Have you tried Mother Mesquites?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|Where's that at?|qw
A|That's at Skillman and L B J|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there is,|sd
A|it's where Skillman, uh, curves into Forest Lane|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's real good Mexican food.|sd
A|Another real good one is, uh, Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|They're both very good.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Oh, that, uh,|%
B|no,|%
B|we haven't explored, uh, you know, too many places.|sd
B|Um, you know, lot of the big name brand, I guess, uh, chains|sd
A|Chains,|b^m
A|uh-huh.|b
B|yeah,|b
B|but, um, oh, we've tried places, you know, down, uh, by the Collin Creek Mall,|sd
B|the, uh, you know, Alvarez,|sd
B|and, um, gosh we tried, what was across the street, El Paso's El Chico's or something,|sd
A|Oh, El Chico's or El Fenix one,|^2
B|yeah,|aa
B|something something like that,|aap_am
A|uh-huh|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Uh, much better.|sd
A|Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites|sd
A|but then fajitas are one of my, uh,|sd
A|I like it better than just about anything|sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|and they make very good fajitas there in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|Oh.|b
A|Especially with butter and honey on them|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I know,|aa
B|I tell, I tell you what.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|They are, they just, um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food.|sv
B|I wish I could make them here at home.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|so do I.|sd
B|Just can't make those flour tortillas.|sd
B|But,|%
A|Well, what else do you like?|qo
B|Well, I love, uh, I love seafood|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I notice they have like the, you know, The Louisiana Purchase, um,|sd
B|Razzoo's has opened up down, you know, off of, um, um, oh, close to six thirty-five.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|now I haven't eaten there.|sd
A|Have you eaten there?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|I have eaten there.|sd
B|Now the only problem, *note the setup for a negative comment|sd
B|I love the food.|sd
B|It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, the service has always been so strange, every time I've been in there.|sd
B|Mostly it's been at lunch time|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, but I hear at night though they have, uh, you know, the outdoor, um, bar,|sd
B|and, um, uh, that's it's really, uh, you know, kind of lively.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.|sv
A|Oh, I, we like, uh, uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's a good restaurant.|sd
B|Oh, well that sounds great.|ba
A|And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, uh, uh, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|b
A|The service is great.|sd
A|They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too.|sd
A|If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh well, I, uh, I have children and, and work,|sd
B|and so we, uh, we can eat a lot of fast food|sd
A|I can remember when our children were small.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We lived in the Chicago area at the time,|sd
A|and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|I know.|ba
A|I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.|sd
B|I, I know,|aa
B|I, I'm so sick of McDonalds,|sd
B|and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time.|sd
B|And, so now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint.|sd
A|Well, Taco Bueno's good|sv
B|Oh and, and cheap too.|sv
A|And cheap,|b^m
A|and cheap.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|but, but the kids, they've got those expensive tastes|sd
B|so, uh, they like Tia's|sd
B|so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|yes|b
A|yes.|b
A|Sounds like my grandchildren.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|I know.|ba
B|They, they, they're just spoiled rotten,|sd
B|but, uh, but, no,|%
B|I, uh, uh, we love to eat out,|sd
B|of course, it's just so much easier and simpler|sv
A|Oh, yes.|aa
B|yeah.|b
B|So we, uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week.|sd
A|Well, it's just my husband and I,|sd
A|and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.|sd
B|Yeah,|b

A|And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners|sd
B|Oh, me too,|aa
B|me too.|aa
B|So, I know, uh, I, I know that I, uh, you know, I just work|sd
B|and I'm just tired when I get home|sd

B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yes,|aa
