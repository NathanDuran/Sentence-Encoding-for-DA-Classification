A|Well, I know that, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I have only like two or three favorite television shows.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who does like L A LAW|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh-huh,|b^m
A|and, uh, he also did HILLSTREET BLUES.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|I like those type of shows.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|we really enjoy that too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't get a lot, to watch a whole lot of T V.|sd
B|We have a couple of young children,|sd
B|and so we're usually outside,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed, we usually watch that,|sd
B|and L A LAW is one of my favorites.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|me, too.|sd
A|I know,|%
A|they, uh, I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns, they start showing some of their newer stuff.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So I thought that was really interesting the way that they did that.|sv
A|Oh, and so you must watch a lot of, uh, Disney or cartoons then?|qy^d
B|Well, we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,|no
B|and I think those programs are really good for children.|sv
B|I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing, you know, not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and they usually, uh, show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world.|sv
B|So.|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|My older son, he's going to be five,|sd
B|and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now.|sd
A|Oh, that's true,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|Well, I noticed that, my kids are, uh, older now,|sd
A|they're uh, getting close to the teenage years.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But they did,|sd
A|we watched all of MISTER ROGERS and everything,|sd
A|but even some of your, uh, cartoons can be very violent|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, you know, they talk about death,|sd
A|and, we were watching, uh, oh gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and, um, I think it was on, I have to remember which channel,|sd
A|but anyway, uh, we were watching that|sd
A|and it was talking about opera,|sd
A|and they showed like what they thought an opera would be,|sd
A|and one of the things was to kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and I thought, Oh, how violent, you know, to kill the rabbit.|sd
A|So he ended up killing the rabbit in the end, uh,|sd
A|but then of course, the rabbit comes back to life and says, well, see this is how an opera is supposed to be.|sd
A|And I thought, gee whiz, if a little kid was watching this, you know, that would be pretty violent even for a small child.|sv
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|and you know, they, especially boys, I mean, they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever, you know.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
A|Well, I don't think cartoons portray that|sv
A|but like,|%
B|No,|aa
B|and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend, I think is the hardest part, you know.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|A cat has nine lives|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but they don't,|ar
A|they just have one like we do|sd
A|Oh, so that's really funny|sv
A|but, uh we've gotten,|sd
A|uh-huh,|%
A|go ahead.|ad
B|I was just going to say, I know that, at least before our kids were born, we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW,|sd
B|Thursday nights usually had pretty good, with that, and as far as very good comedy.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids are in bed by then.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|that's true,|sv
A|that's a good show.|sv
A|I used to watch, uh, DALLAS.|sd
B|We're, we're in Dallas.|sd
A|yeah.|bk
A|I used to watch DALLAS, years ago.|sd
A|And somewhere in the middle I got, uh, bored,|sd
A|and, uh, so I, in fact, I didn't even watch the finale.|sd
A|Uh, you know, that's about how disinterested I had become.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Well, I did watch it just to see what it was|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it wasn't really that great.|sv
B|So.|%
A|Well,|%
B|I think, after a while, they just kind of, you know, there's no new stuff they can do,|sv
A|uh-huh.|b
B|they've done everything dirty in the book you know,|sv
A|Yep.|b
B|so,|%
A|Yep,|aa
A|I know,|sv
A|I know.|sv
A|Was it actually based on a book?|qy
B|Well, no,|nn
B|I imagine,|%
A|Oh, but you were just talking about,|sd
A|okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Everything you could think of, you know had a hard time,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first.|sv
A|That's true,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|Where,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|I never watched KNOTS LANDING,|sd
B|but I think they've had a lot of their characters stay around.|sv
A|Stay.|b^m
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, and if you notice on DALLAS, they lost all the women.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Yes.|b
A|So the men mainly stayed|sd
A|but the women were the ones who left,|sd
A|and I thought that was very interesting and wondered, kind of wondered about that.|sv
A|Uh, well, anyway that's a whole new issue|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|Oh.|b
A|Oh, goodness|ba
A|so. Anyway. I don't know if our five minutes are over yet|sd
A|But we, uh, we also have the paid, uh, television channels.|sd
A|Uh, the only thing I don't like about it, especially with teenagers, is that all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, I know they didn't pick up these curse words from me.|sd
A|So, uh, they had to have picked them up from, uh, the T V.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|One nice thing though about the cable company we use, they have, uh, they have that little parental, uh, uh, key,|sv
B|Where you can lock up, the channel or whatever?|br
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Yeah,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|So, I, I have that at home,|sd
A|and I keep the keys with me.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's about the only way that I can, that I can do it.|sv
A|Because their natural curiosity, you know, to go towards that way and want|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|yeah.|b^m
B|And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now,|sv
B|I mean I just think they watch so much more T V.|sv
B|I try to limit what they watch.|sd
B|They aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day because I think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff, too.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings.|sd
B|It's the only cool time to be outside|sd
A|That's true,|aa
A|well, and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high.|sv
B|Well, true,|aa
A|Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
B|Well, it was nice talking to you, too.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|talk with you later.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
