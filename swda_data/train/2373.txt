B|Good|ba
B|Uh, let's see,|^h
B|so, uh, were we right in the Middle East?|qy
A|Sure.|na
B|Should we have been there?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Did we do what was correct there?|qy
A|I think we should have stayed longer.|sv
B|Should we have fought them harder?|qy
B|Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?|qy^d
A|Uh, I think what we did was good,|na
A|but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.|sv
B|Oh, you agree with Schwartzkopf who says, uh, Drive on into Baghdad.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
A|I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now.|sv
A|And it's almost like they're killing each other off|sv
A|and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all like|sv
B|Would that be so bad?|qy
B|Was there anything there to begin with?|qy
A|Well, I think, I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um.|sv
B|It wasn't ours.|sv
A|Well, no,|aa
A|I just mean that, that, the world in general|sv
B|We've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Um, I don't know,|h
A|I think we should have helped the, the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more, than, rather than just quitting where we did.|sv
B|I agree.|aa
B|Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country.|qy
A|Yes|ny
A|But I think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.|sv
B|Yeah.|b

A|Well, um, I'm, I'm originally from Butler|sd
A|and that's about an hour away from where I am now.|sd

A|And, um, it's, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly.|sd
B|Uh, how high is the highest elevation?|qw
A|Oh, I couldn't even tell you.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, yes|b
B|when I lived in Texas, every year I had to drive, you know.|sd

A|Uh, the farthest away from home?|qy^d
B|Yes.|ny

B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh, now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas,|sd
B|look at your map later and see the, the town of Amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|To just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour.|sd
A|Oh, my|ba
A|Oh, my Gosh.|ba
B|When I was growing up, Now things are different|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and people buy jeans in town,|sd
B|but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|ba
A|Now see for me, that's a long ways.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It is I imagine.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Even, well, like, I, I'm in like a little town right now.|sd
A|It's smaller than Butler|sd
A|and, um, Butler, Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh.|sd
A|So that will give you some idea of where I'm at.|sv
B|Okay.|b
A|And I'm about, I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|I'll look at my map later.|oo_co_cc
B|Wow.|ba
B|How neat.|ba
A|And, uh, I mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town.|sd
A|The college, without the college here, this town would be nothing.|sd
A|It would be absolutely dead.|sd
A|Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants|sd
A|and, and in the summer when we uh,|sd
A|we come up here in the summer,|sd
A|and it's,|%
A|I mean, there's just no one around.|sd
B|So are you working your way through college?|qy
A|Um, well, I go home in the summer|sd
A|and I work in the summer|sd
A|and between what I make in the summer and student loans, that's how I go to college.|sd
B|Well, how neat.|ba
B|What's your major?|qw
A|Finance.|sd
B|Finance.|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, that's interesting.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Um, well, like I said my fianc3ee, *typo|sd
B|Savings and loans, uh,|qy^d
A|No|nn
A|No,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something.|sd
A|I'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something.|sd
B|Oh, that would be great.|ba
B|That would be neat|ba
B|Let's see, uh, so we're all excited in Colorado Springs.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Apple Computer is coming to town.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Yes.|ny
B|The, uh, new employer is in the city.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we're expecting our local economy to Well, maybe not a boom, but, uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.|sd
A|Take a boom a little bit.|^2
A|Well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?|qw
B|Uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent.|sd
A|See that's what it is here too.|sd
B|But, now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|It is.|sv
A|I know people they are out of school for two or three years|sd
A|and they have a job that has nothing to do ...|sd
