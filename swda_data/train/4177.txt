A|Hi.|fp
A|So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have?|qy
B|Uh, actually no,|nn
B|because, because I'm in school.|sd
B|I, I kind of miss out on most of the current events.|sd
B|I just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it.|sd
A|Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then?|qy
B|Uh, I don't watch a lot of it,|ng
B|but that's the|%
B|basically that's my only major source of information.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|What about, what about you?|qo
A|Well, I read, uh,|sd
A|I get a bunch of different things.|sd
A|I get a newspaper every day|sd
A|and I try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that|sd
A|and I look through, uh,|sd
A|I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, I pretty much read that cover to cover|sd
A|and I, as far as, you know,|%
A|that satisfies most of the short term news I get.|sd
A|Uh, don't watch much T V,|sd
A|don't have enough time|sd
A|and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know,|sd
A|they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that's about all I ever hear of it.|sd
A|Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK|sd
A|and for the longer term I, I read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they,|sd
A|the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news,|sd
A|but it's recent material.|sd
B|And it's more in depth.|^2
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is, it is more in depth, less broad.|sv
A|Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad,|ar
A|but it's just more in depth|sv
A|and, uh, it is, it is more it is more just significant information, you know.|sv
A|It is the big events, not the little events.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know.|sd
B|I know,|aa
B|where they're just trying to fill in.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow|sd
B|I know,|b
B|I do, I do, too.|sd
A|and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|you may find one little, uh, news item interesting|sv
B|so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that's about what it ends up being.|sv
A|Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|actually, you mention NEWSWEEK,|sd
B|I, I, I do like, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.|sd
B|I don't get to read it as much as I like,|sd
B|but that's, I think that's a good magazine.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think they're about the same.|sv
A|I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind.|sv
A|And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you,|qw
A|I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring?|qw
B|Well right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit.|sv
A|I think it will,|aa
A|uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence,|sd
A|but we've yet to see it|sd
A|and|%
A|it's real short term yet, though,|sd
A|I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that since that happened|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|so,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they like to tell us that it's going to be important|sv
B|I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting|sv
A|I think it is, too.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I think that's a possibility,|sv
A|uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
A|For the companies that already have a presence over there|sv
A|and, uh, I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time.|sd
B|Oh, yeah|b
B|so they have a toe hold,|bf
B|I good toe hold.|bf
A|Yep.|aa
A|Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand.|sv
A|But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist|sv
B|so,|%
A|Yes.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist,|sv
A|even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Like, England doesn't want to do one thing|sd
A|and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing|sd
A|and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And some of it, I mean, is,|%
A|I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I can understand their viewpoint,|sd
B|they're just, they're starting off,|sd
B|their economy's a little bit weak,|sd
B|so you want to get established before they|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Before they open up their borders to everyone.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|totally.|aa
A|Uh, what is the, uh,|qw
A|do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that?|qy
B|Actually I'm not really into sports.|^h
B|My roommates are,|^h
B|so, unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports.|sd
A|Against your will.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we have to, fight over the remote control.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|at least you guys have a remote control.|sd
A|It's sometimes better to not have one of those.|sv
A|Course, you can always mislocate it. Or misplace it, I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it|sd
A|and,|%
