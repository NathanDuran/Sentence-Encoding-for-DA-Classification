A|Very good.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, discussion or on child care.|sd
B|Do you have any children?|qy
A|Uh, they're all grown up.|arp_nd
B|Oh|b
B|I work in a day-care center|sd
B|and .|%
A|Oh, well, you know all about it then.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I enjoy it a lot.|sd
A|It's been quite a few years.|sd
A|I have grandchildren but, uh, haven't really been into selecting child care for them,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Oh.|b
A|And it's been quite a few years since I've had to think about that.|sd
B|Do they go to a day-care center|qy
B|or do they stay at,|qrr
A|No.|nn
A|Uh, my daughter that has three stays home with her children,|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|and one of my daughters has one|sd
A|but an aunt keeps the baby.|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|But I would, I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays,|sd
A|but I would imagine it's very hard.|sd
B|I, I think so.|sv
B|I think it's hard to find a good day care.|sv
B|I have worked in at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But this one that I'm in now is, is very good.|sd
B|And one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And like in Pennsylvania for babies, that's what I work with, there has to be a one to four ratio at the most. No more than four babies per care giver.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But we keep it down to like two to one.|sd
A|Oh, well, that's good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that makes it a little easier to deal with.|sd
A|I've always thought, you know, it would be really tough.|sd
A|What if you had a fire or something with babies?|qh
B|Oh, I know.|aa
B|We,|%
A|You would have to be able to have enough,|sv
A|you know, you'd have to be able to get them all out.|sv
B|What we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are, um, low to the ground|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they're reenforced real strong|sd
B|and they'll sit four babies.|sd
B|We would just lie them in there|sd
B|and they roll real well and maneuver.|sd
A|Oh, well, that's, that's a,|%
B|That will get them out.|sd
A|I hadn't thought about that.|sd
A|But I was thinking, oh, my gosh, if they had very many babies, they couldn't possibly get them all out.|sd
B|No|ar
A|But you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess.|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|Oh|%
B|Right.|b
A|well, that's neat.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's certainly something we hope never happens.|sd
A|Well, do most of your day-care workers really care about the children,|qy
A|or is it just a job for them?|qrr
B|Most really care, in this center, really care.|sd
B|Uh, most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And really there's only like eight children per room|sd
B|and then there's like two or three, mostly three care givers in each room.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that enables them to spend more time with the children.|sd
B|Sometimes I feel like all I'm doing is changing diapers, giving bottles, and putting babies down for a nap.|sd
B|So, it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's easy to get attached to them too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|How old a group, how old are the children go with this center where you work?|qw
B|Um, in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I have the real, real young ones in my room.|sd
A|You've got the little bitty ones.|bf
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Those are the, probably the the best group to have.|sv
B|They're, you know, they're wonderful.|sd
B|They don't complain too much|sd
A|And they're fun.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|They are a lot of fun.|sd
A|Babies are fun,|sv
A|and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet,|sv
A|so.|%
B|Not quite.|aa
B|It's a,|%
B|when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things|sd
B|and|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you have to be real careful all the, everything is baby proof.|sd
B|You know, all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything|sd
B|but they try.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area?|qy
B|But, yeah,|b
B|In my area|b^m
B|because I live in a college town in Penn State University|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I,|%
B|there is a lot of, a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, in general though I've, I've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers I've worked at, and it, all and all|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's not my choice for when, when I have children|sd
B|but, but some people don't have a choice.|sd
A|Sometimes it's a have to.|bf
B|Yes.|aa
A|I hear a lot of the girls I work with, uh, constantly, oh,|sd
A|I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about. You know?|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids.|sd
B|That is sad.|ba
A|And it's really bad, you know.|sv
A|One of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place,|sd
A|and then they called her one afternoon and said, well, we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here.|sd
A|Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today,|^q
A|and we just now found her.|^q
B|What?|br
A|They had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon.|sd
B|Oh, my God.|ba
A|And so immediately she says, well, I can't have any confidence in them anymore,|sd
A|if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short.|^q
B|Oh.|b
A|But one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus.|sd
B|Oh, my God.|ba
A|And this was four hours later, you know.|sd
B|Oh, that poor child.|ba
A|And, uh, so, you know,|%
A|what do you do?|qh
B|That's awful.|ba
A|So she has switched to a different center now|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|Well, I,|%
