A|I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later|sv
A|but, um, I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers.|sd
A|I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground|sd
A|and that, um,|%
A|yeah ,|%
A|I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system,|sd

A|I mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man.|sv
A|I don't care if you're President.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far|sv
B|I couldn't do it.|sd

A|because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|See, I even know his name because he's on the news a lot,|sd
A|and I never had to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.|sd

A|he didn't want them,|sd
A|so he gave them to Alan,|sd
A|and Alan and his Dad had plans that night|sd

B|With baseball tickets.|^2
A|and we ended up with them, right.|sd
A|And so we were, walking up|sd
B|Yeah .|b
A|and I looked at my husband|sd
A|and I said, you know what Kyle this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip|sd
A|I bet these are really good seats|^q

B|Wow.|ba
A|oh, yeah,|aa
A|we they called us at five|sd
A|and the game started at seven|sd
A|so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked|sd
A|and so we took two kids with us|sd
A|and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,|sd
B|Because they're fancy seats and stuff.|^2
A|yeah,|aa

A|I just was there, you know,|sd
A|like I'm loaded,|sd
A|I'm here, you know,|sd
A|and, uh, it was just kind of funny|sd
A|because, you know, but we got to sit by first base|sd
A|if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.|sd
B|I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game.|sd
B|I rarely go|sd
B|but we went last year|sd
B|because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and if there's a game on, he's watching it.|sd
B|I mean, that's all there is to it,|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|and he's like glued at the T V.|sd
A|I'm glad my husband's not like that.|sd

B|My brother's like that|sd
B|and, um, see he goes to a lot of games,|sd
B|not a real lot,|sd
B|but he tries to go,|sd
B|then my father got us some tickets,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so my brother's wife and my husband and I went.|sd
B|Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd,|sd
B|it was nice weather and stuff,|sd
B|it wasn't a real problem,|sd
B|but you sit there in a crowd,|sd
B|and you're waiting and waiting and waiting|sd
B|and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um,|sd
B|because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,|sd
A|That's funny.|ba
B|and, um, so you sit there|sd
B|and you wait for the longest time really bored,|sd
B|and then all of a sudden something happens|sd
B|but you happen to look the other way during the time,|sd
A|You miss the whole thing.|^2
B|yeah,|aa
B|and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen|sd
B|and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of O strip east to west, eastern part,|sd

A|She has twelve children.|na
B|Oh, my God, the poor woman.|ba
A|She looks gorgeous,|sd
A|no|ar

B|Were any of them twins?|qy
A|I mean, I'm not kidding you.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them|sv
A|No,|aa
A|your,|%
A|I have a friend now that has seven.|sd
A|And, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they're all real young,|sd
A|they're just raised right|sd
A|that's what God's told them to do|sd
A|but they're not condemning you,|sd
A|if you,|%
A|we only have one child, you know,|sd
A|they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do that,|sd
A|you get a conviction like that|sd
A|and you think everyone should have it.|sd
A|And so I'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't do that at all.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You go in their bathroom|sd
A|and there's ten tooth brushes in there.|sd
A|And I always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning|sd
B|But how do they afford to even have the kids, uh,|qw
B|we're expecting our first baby, almost any day Uh-huh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|They live lean for one thing|sd
A|and they tithe|sd
A|and they|%
A|it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole|sd
A|we don't honor God with this portion|sd
A|and so they,|%
A|I think that helps a lot.|sv
A|I think that's the key, in he, like his sales last year|sv
A|he just works a normal job.|sd
A|He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand,|sd
A|but last year he made|sd
A|that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.|sd
A|He loves God,|sd
A|I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|and he got to do it|sd
A|and so God just really blesses him in ways like that,|sd
A|do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a blessing|ad
A|and, and some people you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,|sv
A|but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things|sv
A|but it's a different kind|sv
A|and a lot times people think, oh, well, I'm not blessed|sv
A|I have an old car.|^q
A|But you've got five kids, you know,|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this,|^q
A|there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he's, you know,|%
A|a lot of wisdom in it.|sd
A|And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything|sd
A|but training, and training is different than anything else|sv
A|in, in psychology doesn't address it.|sv
A|A lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE|sv
A|and they don't quote you the proverb out of it,|sd
A|but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the BIBLE|sv
A|and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child|sv
A|so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What I mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing|sd
A|and so, you know, they do that|sd
A|and they, they just live lean pretty much|sd
A|they don't, she doesn't shop at Foley's you know, and stuff like that.|sd
A|But a lot women die or shop at Foley's|sv
A|so things ,|%
B|I, I don't know what Foley's is|sd
A|It's like a Macy's, kind of store,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's pretty nice|sd
A|and everything's pretty expensive|sd
A|and, you know, you just can't do that|sd
A|and you don't go to baseball games as much|sd
A|or you get pictures like we did.|sd
A|You know what I mean?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|You do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways|sv

A|but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|well, that makes a really big difference.|sv
B|But, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids|sd

A|I keep saying we need to have one.|sd
A|They go, okay, then start one.|sd
A|But everybody wants to do it|sd
A|but, you know, God's sitting on my heart|sd
A|and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it,|sd
A|but anyway, so they could really only have four members on the team.|sd
A|I think they only have four boys .|sd
A|I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids *listen: this and utt2 as one utt|sv
