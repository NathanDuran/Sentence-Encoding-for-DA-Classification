B|I have one child|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you know, when, when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, I don't particularly,|%
B|I think it's sort of a waste of money to go real, to a real high priced restaurant.|sv
A|Do you go like home cooking, like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria?|qy
B|Um, Not really.|ng
B|We go more for the, uh, Chinese and Italian and stuff like that. Mexican, stuff that I can't cook|sd

A|And those are excellent.|sd
A|They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|It's not the, the rinky Chinese decorations|sd
