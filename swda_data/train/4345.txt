B|I, uh, get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio.|sd
B|Uh, that is one of my big sources for current events information.|sd
B|Uh, I really like that coverage.|sd
B|My wife, uh, on the other hand is home most of the day|sd
B|and she watches a lot of the cable news network.|sd
B|Have you seen, uh, have you, uh, ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|we don't have the, uh, national public radio in, in my area.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I can hear it at the, uh, uh, oh, the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater, which is about an hour away,|sd
A|but the F M signal doesn't reach this far.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit.|sd
A|It gives you a whole different perspective on the news, uh, when you hear it from, say, a European point of view, or from the country of origin.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I agree with you, too, on the, uh, uh, the cable channel, C N N and HEADLINE NEWS.|sd
A|Uh, I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh, which is why I rely on shortwave and, and then the cable, cable, C N N.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm, uh, interested in the, in the shortwave aspect of it.|sd
B|Uh, how do you find that the, the coverage from other places in the world uh, compares with the American coverage of,|qo
B|how do you think that, uh, the viewpoints differ?|qo
A|I think a lot of it is just, uh, the fact that in the U S you're so far removed, uh, in a lot of cases from, say, conflicts|sv
A|or, or it's not happening in your backyard|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so it's, it's more of a, it's not as a personal, uh, the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than, than what's on shortwave.|sv
A|It's, B B C is, uh, oh, I don't know the right word, is, is almost, uh,|sv
A|they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it just,|%
A|they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions.|sv
B|Do you think, then, that, uh, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts?|qy
A|Uh, very much so,|na
A|very much so,|na
A|and I, I think a lot of it is, uh, especially T V news,|sv
A|they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to, uh, oh, to really decipher the news and to really explain it.|sv
A|I mean, I, you know, I think it's important to interpret it,|sv
A|but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to, to do the interpreting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Which, uh, which approach do you find to be, uh, more useful, the, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting?|qy
A|Oh, I like the straight reporting.|sd
A|Uh, and then I, I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it.|sd
A|It's, it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, I always think it's humorous when, when the President gives the State of the Union and, uh, for thirty minutes|sv
A|and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard.|sd
A|And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they, what they write into it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So I, overall, I think I would rather hear just straight reporting.|sd
B|One of the things that I found interesting last year during the, uh, the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that were available.|sv
B|Uh, there was a, there was, uh, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely, uh, uh, hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory,|sd
B|and while he was being severely, uh, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda,|sd
B|but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, you know, this isn't a baby milk factory,|sd
B|how could he say it was, uh,|qh
B|I, I think that, that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I think people are, people have that opinion.|sv
A|They, they want to sit down in front of the TV and, uh, or at a, read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs, uh, and, and find out|sv
