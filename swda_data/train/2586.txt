A|So, do you fish?|qy
B|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|My dad has a lake cabin,|sd
B|and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.|sd
B|It takes us about three hours to get there.|sd
B|And we go, and we fish,|sd
B|and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,|sd
B|but it's fun.|sd
A|Uh, from a boat or from shore?|qy
B|From the dock, from shore.|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|Uh, mostly catfish|qy
A|or,|%
B|Oh, mostly we catch carp.|sd
B|If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.|sd
B|And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.|sd
B|But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.|sd
B|What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.|sd
B|And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.|sd
B|Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,|sd
B|so we don't ever catch enough to eat.|sd
B|Carp is usually pretty much fun.|sd
B|Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.|sd
B|And that, that's a pretty good fight.|sd
B|So that's a lot of fun.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|A real light line, real light rig?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
B|They fight hard.|sd
A|Fish in Colorado different than that.|sv
B|Yeah?|bh
A|Mostly trout in the mountains.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and in the rivers and stuff?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|mountain streams and rivers.|sd
B|Are they good to eat?|qy
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|very. Yeah, very much there, you know.|sd
B|Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?|qy
A|Um, by and large, no.|nn
A|But, but they're big fun.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I've been,|sd
B|is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that|qy
B|or,|%
A|What?|br
B|Are you fly fishing|qy
B|or are you using a bobber?|qrr
A|I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I cast a ways.|sd
A|I'm not highly proficient,|sd
A|but it's fun.|sd
B|I've never even tried that.|sd
B|My,|%
B|if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble|sd
A|Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.|oo_co_cc
A|You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|You're casting the weight of the line.|qy
B|With the little thing on the end.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well,  the fly on the end weighs nothing.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I thought it had a weight.|sd
A|It weighs less than the line.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  you whip the line.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|As you whip it, over your head,  or  side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?|qy^d
A|Well, no,|nn
A|no.|nn
A|You fish upstream.|sd
B|Oh, you fish upstream?|qy
A|Right.|na
A|And then you let it carry it downstream.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then you reel it in,|sd
A|and you do it again.|sd
B|You hope that they think it's a bug and,  and eat  it.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Jump at it.|bf
A|Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.|sd
B|That's a fish?|br
A|No,|nn
A|no.|nn
A|It, it looks like a grub.|sd
A|Yeah.|%
B|Oh, it's a, it's a lure.|bf
A|Okay,|aa
A|whenever you, yeah,|%
A|a lure, a fly.|sd
B|I see.|bk

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me. Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|b
A|Uh,|%
B|Did someone just come up with this design,|qy
B|and, and you're going to make one for yourself,|qy^d
A|Uh,|%
B|or  are you going to buy it?|qrr
A|You can buy them.|sd
A|Uh, I've got some.|sd
A|And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year,|bf
B|huh?|^g
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Um.|b
A|You know how that changes, the phase of the moon|sd
A|and,|%
B|I guess so.|na
B|We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I, You see, I'm from west Texas.|sd
B|but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.|sd
B|Oh, are you?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Where are you from?|qw
A|Lubbock.|sd
B|Oh, I'm from Midland.|sd
A|Oh, another west Texan.|bf

B|so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|b
B|I've been up there.|sd
A|It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.|sv
B|I didn't catch anything,|sd
B|but I've been up there|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's fun.|sv
B|It's lazy.|sv
B|Take a picnic lunch.|sd
B|I used to do that with my dad.|sd
B|Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we do most of our fishing at night.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Just from the heat of it all.|sd
B|That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.|sv
A|It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.|sd
B|It does?|bh
B|I've only been up there once.|sd
B|In the summer. Well,|sd
B|no,|ar
B|I've been up there twice in the summer.|sd
B|But both times it was really pleasant.|sd
B|In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that?|sd
A|June?|qy
B|We were in Mesa Verde Park,|sd
B|and it was like the end of It was just before July fourth.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.|sd
B|We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better|sd
B|And here it went and it froze,|sd
B|and it snowed on us.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We did not know what to do about it.|sd
A|Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.|sv
A|It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,  hearing  the crickets, and listening to the birds and,  seeing  the squirrels and,  camping  out, and eating out,  of  doors|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,|%
B|Do you have to,|qy
B|do you wear waders when you fish?|qy
A|Uh, I probably ought to.|ng
A|I just freeze.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|well, you know,  ankle deep or standing on  the bank, and slipping it out there.|sd
B|That's cold water around there.|sd
B|Um. Do you have any,|qy
A|You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,  out there,|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|and  you know how it is.|qy^d
A|The water's kind of,|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,|bf
B|and you move a little closer.|bf
A|And then you're in to it just a little bit,|sd
A|and then you splash in|sd
A|and,  the  next thing you know, your knees are wet.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you have any kids that you take fishing?|qy
A|Uh, got a stepdaughter.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|She's real sweet.|sd
A|And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|A fuzzy little dog.|sd
B|I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And the little one, of course, is, could care less.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|The,  uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,|sd
B|we got him a little pole last year,|sd
B|and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up|sd
B|That was what he considered fishing|sd
B|This year, he's gotten to where he can.|sd
B|We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,|sd
B|and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And he started trying to cast it.|sd
B|So, he, he was kind of getting there|sd
B|but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you guys sure want to be out of range.|sv
B|He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.|sd
A|It takes time.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?|sd
A|Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.|sd
A|And we still had a good time out,  of  the deal.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|My husband would like to live there,|sd
B|but I don't know. All of our family is here|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well, and you've got to have,|sd
A|you've got to work for a living.|sd
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|but T I is up there,|sd
B|so that part of it would probably work out|sd
A|What division you all in?|qw
B|I'm sorry, what?|br
A|What division are you all in?|qw
B|We're both, uh,|sd
B|I was, uh, military,|sd
B|but he's division three.|sd
B|It goes back and forth.|sd
B|Division, well,|sd
B|maybe division one right now.|sd
B|He's in computers.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, the only thing up here,  is division one.|sd
B|And he's in school,  and everything else.|sd
B|I have some friends who work up there.|sd
A|Oh, yeah?|bh
B|Kathy and Kevin Guy.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|And they like to fish.|sd
B|They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.|sd
B|Her dad has a cabin,|sd
B|and they go fishing, up there.|sd
A|Oh, fishing's,  fishing is fun up here.|sd
B|So that would be neat to,  try it some time.|sd
A|It's  not,|sd
A|It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.|sd
A|But it is fun.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|You know,  The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.|sv
B|long as  you have a good time, that's the main point|sv
B|so,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.|sv
B|Definitely more to look at.|aa
A|And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.|sd
B|We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.|sd
B|And we figured we were up a long way off.|sd
B|And then it rained that night,|sd
B|and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?|sd
B|And we got up the next day,|sd
B|and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away|sd
B|And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.|sd
B|So, that was kind of funny.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I just love the way it looks.|sd
B|I could almost just watch the|sd
B|we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,|sd
B|and if you were there. I mean,|sd
B|it was,|sd
B|one time we were there,|sd
B|and I guess it was late May,|sd
B|so it was really your spring almost,  you  know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,|sd
B|and the creek was just wild, just running.|sd
B|And, and all the white water and noise and the,|sd
B|it was just beautiful.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|it gets foamy almost.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,|%
