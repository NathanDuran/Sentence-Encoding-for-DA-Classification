A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|All right.|b
B|Last thing I saw was, um, I think, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts.|sd
A|Oh, I hadn't seen that,|sd
A|but I've heard that it's real good.|sd
B|My husband didn't like it that much.|sd
B|I thought it was okay.|sd
B|It was a little strange, you know,|sd
B|this woman supposedly is, um, being mentally abused by her husband, you know,|sd
B|he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house,|sd
B|and she figures out this way to, um, to leave him secretly.|sd
B|You know, she fakes her death kind of thing|sd
B|and he tracks her down|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh|b
B|So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she realizes he's in the house, you know, after her,|sd
B|but, uh, kind of had the feeling along that, uh,|sd
B|why didn't she just tell him to straighten up.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, why didn't she just tell|sd
B|Hey look bucko,|^q
B|you don't get away with this nonsense|^q
A|Oh|b
B|But anyhow, um, what have you seen?|qw
A|Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we went to two movies.|sd
A|We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams.|sd
B|Um.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I really liked both of them.|sd
A|I really did.|sd
A|AWAKENING was, it was kind of sad to me.|sd
A|It really was,|sd
A|and it would, it would be to anyone because, you know, they really don't know that much about it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So this is where the people have been kind of|bf
B|I don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma, for a long time.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|And the drugs let them come back.|bf
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|But the drugs didn't work for long,|sd
A|and they started having real bad side effects.|sd
B|Oh|b
A|And this is about nineteen sixty-four, I believe, or something like that,|sd
A|and there still hasn't been any, you know, new development in prescribed drugs that can help it.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|But, yeah,|b
A|there, you know,|%
A|it, it was a big breakthrough,|sd
A|but in time, you know, the, all the side effects started showing.|sd
B|Well, how bad were the side effects?|qw
A|Bad.|sd

B|You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, uh, a bit of a variety actor, you know.|sv
B|At first he was just a big muscle man.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But he's kind of branching out.|sv
A|He sure is.|aa
A|He is,|aa
A|as a matter of fact, um, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety player more so than he is, because he really played the part good.|sv
A|You know, he could be this rough, tough guy and then, you know, this substitute teacher.|sv
B|Um.|%
A|It was really good.|sd
B|Well, there was a movie out,|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. And, and some of the other things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b

B|and I, I have some,|sd
B|one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I just keep telling her, how can you do that?|sd
B|And I told her when she had her, her little girl.|sd
B|I said, now you better get out of the habit of watching those.|sd
B|You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl,|^q
B|and she says her little girl's into it now.|sd
