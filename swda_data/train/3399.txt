A|Uh, well, I guess social change takes in a, a big category,|sv
A|but, uh, I guess the, the one aspect of it that I took in, uh, consideration is more economical.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they, and they compared to the son's, that he was making now.|sd
A|And even though the son was probably more successful, you know, higher up in the, the management ladder uh, his, he was actually making less money when you when you go by costs of living.|sd
B|Right.|b

B|Right,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|And it's depending on where you live, though, too.|sv

B|but like clothing and styles, lot of those changed.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I, I, I don't think they, they consider,|sv
A|like I say, it's a broad category,|sv
A|it's just I'm not economical|sd
A|but uh, even attitudes on, on clothing and stuff, uh, I know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
