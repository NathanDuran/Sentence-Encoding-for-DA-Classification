A|Hi.|fp
B|Hi, uh,|fp
B|as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, uh, took on a painting project in my bathroom|sd
B|and I had wallpaper up,|sd
B|I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that|sd
B|and it took me all weekend|sd
B|because, uh, the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down|sd
B|and that had to dry.|sd
B|And then the spackling had to dry a day|sd
B|and then the painting took another day.|sd
A|You didn't try rewallpapering?|qy
A|You just, uh,|%
B|No.|nn
B|I, I just painted.|sd
A|Did you use a textured paint|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, no.|nn
B|Actually, the wall behind the paper was smooth|sd
B|so, I just used a, like a semigloss.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|And,|%
A|Well, did you get good results?|qy
B|Well, no,|nn
B|not really.|ng
B|I need to,|sd
B|it, it looks so, bad you can see where those spackling marks were.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I need to, uh, either paper back over it or do something|sd
A|But it just didn't, it didn't, it didn't cover it?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|It covered the spots pretty good|sd
B|but it didn't, excuse me, it didn't, uh, uh, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.|sd
A|Well, we did a, uh,|sd
A|we moved, oh, last August|sd
A|and we're getting a house,|sd
A|my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den|sd
A|and we decided,|%
A|we went to, I've forgotten , one of the paint stores|sd
A|and they just said, oh, you can get by,|sd
A|and I forgotten what it was you put down, and then you can just paint right over the dark.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, more or less.|arp_nd
A|After about, uh, half dozen coats it looks reasonable|sv
A|but it kept,|%
A|the, the dark|%
A|it was, uh, just a real dark, uh, wood grain type paneling|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was smooth|sd
A|and, uh, and we would, we put this stuff on|sd
A|and, and it supposedly textured it or did something to it|sd
A|and, but because of the dark behind it, it was really hard to cover|sd
A|and like pages|%
B|Was it like a primer?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it|sd
A|because we were, you know, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it|sd
A|and we were painting it and trying to do, uh, you know, make it,|sd
A|and it, it really was, you know,|sd
A|the advice they give you is, uh,|%
A|the job was considerably tougher than we thought.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, particularly when you try to,|%
A|I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling|sd
A|and, uh, they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate|sd
A|and it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling|sd
A|and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.|sd
B|Oh, my goodness,|ba
B|that's an awful lot.|ba
A|Have you, have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted?|qy
B|Not inside.|ng
B|Now, uh, when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it.|sd
B|That was one of the requirements from, you know, F H A that the house be painted before we bought it|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it was fairly reasonable.|sd
B|We have a brick house|sd
B|but all the trim around the house was, uh,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|if I remember right, it was like five hundred dollars.|sd
A|Oh, that's quite reasonable.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|so that wasn't too bad.|sd
A|Um, problem|%
A|have you, have you tried matching paint lately?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I haven't.|sd
A|My wife,|%
A|we, we built a shed over the long way ,|sd
A|actually, it took,|sd
A|this is not on the topic|sd
A|but I did finish it.|sd
A|But my wife went to the, uh, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, uh, a copy, took a piece of brick|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she wanted to paint the shed|sd
A|it's, it's a wooden shed, uh,|sd
A|and she took it|sd
A|and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, they got,|sd
A|and, uh, and, in fact she put some right|sd
A|she got,|sd
A|they mixed, uh, a gallon of it|sd
A|and, uh, it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint, uh,|sd
A|and it does it, uh, oh, electronically some, something,  magic.|sd
B|Oh,|b
B|so,  they did do a good job?|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|you know, they,|sd
A|but it's electronic.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, you put your sample under this thing|sd
A|and it looks at it and, uh, and determines the,|sd
A|and it, it's really remarkable.|sd
A|Uh, the problem they had|sd
A|and then they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, but they didn't, didn't occur to them that, um, that they could have taken a sample um, from,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I forgotten, *listen|sd
A|this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something|sd
A|but anyway. It's, it's remarkable.|sd
A|That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the, you know,|sd
A|you want this, you want this to look like this|sd
A|and you want that to look like that|sd
A|and, of course, if it's all white you're all right|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but when you start getting into colors,|sv
A|have you had problems getting colors to match?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
B|As a matter of fact, uh, what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a, uh, a blue|sd
B|and the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match, you know,|sd
A|Um.|b
A|So,|%
B|it's the very same type of paint and everything,|sd
A|Gosh.|ba
B|So,|%
A|So you,|%
A|so what's your,|qw
A|what's the solution then?|qw
B|Oh, I have no idea.|no
B|I repainted the whole thing.|sd
A|Oh, my|ba
A|Well, at least you'll get very good at it, right?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|You could go back and, and paint, the whole thing over|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|that's, uh, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting|sv
A|because it, uh, it seems like everybody has a, you know, to go in and do,|sv
A|I'll just do a little bit here and a little there .|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Although, the, uh,|%
A|it's uh, it,|%
A|we almost one day,|%
A|we painted the house to, uh,|sd
A|we painted, we painted the whole inside|sd
A|and it had all this dark trim.|sd
A|We thought, uh, you know,|sd
A|we did the one wall but the other trim,|sd
A|I'm trying to think,|^h
A|I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be, uh,|sd
A|they don't do that in the newer houses now|sd
A|we don't,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|the mold , everything is white .|sd
A|In a new house everything is white.|sd
B|White,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.|sd
A|Oh, good luck|ba
A|We wound up selling the house.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Actually, I, I don't know whether it made,|sd
A|actually it does,|sv
A|it's interesting that the white, um, makes the rooms look bigger.|sv
A|One of the,|%
A|in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room, it has molding, uh, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that that actually, that are along the walls, you know, up a couple of feet.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And my wife painted those, the insides of those dark blue.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|ba
A|And, uh, it makes the room look remarkably smaller.|sd
B|Huh. She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim, what color ?|qw^d
A|The trim, is still white.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|The, the molding|%
B|White.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but by,|%
A|and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but it makes the room look smaller which is, uh uh, which is,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|it explains why they, why they have everything white|sv
A|but I, you wouldn't think that I,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|well, maybe, maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but,|%
B|Well, uh, what about the lighting?|qw
B|Did it make a big difference?|qy
A|Uh, not particularly|ng
A|because the house has so many windows|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|bk
A|uh, it has|%
A|the, the, the living room has four, uh, good size windows|sd
A|and, uh, well, of course, at night|sd
A|but with the,|%
A|we have, we have a soccer field that's, um, oh, about a hundred yards from our house|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the lights shine right at our house.|sd
A|It's kind of,|%
A|we didn't know that when we bought the house|sd
A|but,|%
B|So that, uh,|%
B|you get some,|%
B|the color doesn't really matter for, because you have that light.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
A|We have a lot of light,|sd
A|yeah.|ny
A|And, well, it, it, it, um, well, it's just, uh, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet|sd
A|and then above that we left it white|sd
A|so. Anyway, it didn't, it didn't change|sd
B|I see .|ba
A|but the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away|sd
A|it didn't,|%
A|it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're we're really on to that, that the masking is,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you have to do that very, very carefully.|sd
B|And it takes a long time,|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|You can work yourself to death.|sv
A|Well, I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Really,|aa
B|no kidding.|aa
A|It's kind of frustrating.|sv
B|It is.|aa
B|A lot of work,|sv
B|a lot of work.|sv
A|Well, I've got to go to a meeting.|sd
A|It's been good talking to you.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
