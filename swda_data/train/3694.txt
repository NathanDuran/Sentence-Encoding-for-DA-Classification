A|First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing .|sd
A|Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly.|sd
A|I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it, it.|%
A|It doesn't seem like,|sv
A|but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's kind of dangerous.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't know.|h
B|We live, um, well, I'm close to Salt Lake|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, you know.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Really, it's, it's fairly clean, um,|sd
B|I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some,|sd
B|but, you know how quite a,|%
A|But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier?|qy
B|Yeah|ny
A|Oh .|bk
B|I think sometimes it seems to be|sv
B|but, But, uh, anyway, I don't know.|h
A|That's an interesting thought.|ba
B|I know there's a lot of plants here,|sd
B|when I drive down you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,|%
A|Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat,|sd
A|and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, like a smog problem or something like that.|sv
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|We, we have a real fog problem. Um.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, um,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's real hilly there.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that is probably something that plays a big factor.|sv
A|I think probably just, uh, a lot of factories, um, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's, that's what I see burning a lot.|sd
B|I'm not exactly sure what they're burning.|sd
B|I know, uh-huh, there are some oil companies,|sd
B|and I'm sure that that contributes a lot|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|just the burning of the|sv
A|Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?|qy
B|Oh, I don't know.|no

A|Um.|b
B|I know, uh,|%
B|I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything,|qy^d
B|but I know I think they, they differ from state to state.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|But, um, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others.|sv

A|We just.|%
B|and I, I think they burn a lot there, too.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|We just had a big, uh, thing here in Waco.|sd
A|They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill.|sd
A|And, uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And so they,|%
B|Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that.|sd
