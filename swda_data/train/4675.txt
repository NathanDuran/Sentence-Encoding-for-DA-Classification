B|All rightie.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Do you have a budget that you go on?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|I sure do.|sd
B|Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet|sd
B|and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay|sd
B|and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it tends to work out pretty well that way.|sv
B|I can anticipate, you know, a little better.|sd
B|I usually try to guesstimate|sd
B|and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left  at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So that works okay for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|same here.|sd
A|Uh, very  seldom are they any different.|sd
A|And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And then we put our receipts in there, you know,|sd
A|and usually that's enough.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Luckily I don't either.|sd
B|I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick|sd
B|but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|right.|b
A|In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day|sd
B|But you so you know what  I'm saying,|qy^d
B|yeah.|%
A|Yeah.|ny
A|that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?|qy
B|I,|%
B|sometimes it can be.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|Sometimes  it can be.|na
B|I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh, I'm not working right now.|sd
A|I worked for P I E|sd
A|and then, uh, they went bankrupt|sd

B|and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|So,|%
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I, for, for years got paid once a month|sd
B|and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,|sd
B|for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|but I would pay all of them at one sitting|sd
B|and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|And, and it worked okay for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't know.|h
A|And,|%
B|Right  now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well,  see, some people are, some aren't|sv
A|because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and none of those are really interested in sewing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
