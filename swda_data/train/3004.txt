A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, she lives in Utah,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Oh, uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|That's the way we always were.|sd
A|We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.|ad
B|Okay,|aa
B|let's do|ad
A|So, you ready?|qy
A|My children are all gone already.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're, they're all out on their own.|sd
A|So, uh, do you want to start first do you work?|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|No,|nn
B|I don't,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I stay home most of the time|sd
B|but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, you know, there's a,|%
B|my neighbor she tends children though|sd
B|and, and, um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, um, have a, a a law to have them certified or, or not.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that|sv
A|Right.|b
B|because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to be on , get an okay seal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|but yet most of the problems we hear,|sd
A|of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, the individual incidence or something.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, now, usually when I have someone tend, um,|sd
B|my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere|sd
B|but,|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|how old, is your oldest?|qw
B|before,|%
B|He's almost a teenager|sd
A|Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|he's, he's very good.|sd
B|Um, but, um, before that I would, I would use, uh, kids from our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they did a good job, for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Um, but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center, or anything,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home.|sd
A|That's the way with me.|aa
A|I, I worked four years one time,|sd
A|but my last two children were, uh, both entering high school age.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, they were, of course, gone while I was working|sd
A|so it wasn't a problem I saw,|sd
A|and I stayed home the rest of the time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, so I didn't have that problem either.|sd
A|Now I have, I,|%
A|my oldest daughter she has two children|sd
A|and they've been in day care, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|she works full time.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's hard.|bf
A|It, it's difficult|sd
A|but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.|sd
B|Well, some people aren't.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|She, she surprised me though.|sd
A|She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with, with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.|sd
B|Oh, is that, is that right?|bh
A|So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with, with the children.|sd
B|I think that's really important.|ba
A|And, uh, they've used the day care most of the time.|sd
A|They tried one once.|sd
A|They had a lady come in.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.|sd
A|And it did not work out. Uh, at all|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It, she thought it was going to.|sd
A|She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out, in the morning,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, the lady called|sd
A|and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble.|sd
A|And this baby is the, is the most pleasant, uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually.|sd
A|And, and she was having problems with her,|sd
A|and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Well, my daughter decided to call them and check|sd
A|and things weren't okay|sd
B|Oh.|ba
A|Her, her one son was watching the soapies|sd
A|which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.|sd
B|Oh.|ba
A|And so that ended that, episode,|sd
B|Yeah.|ba
A|and she was most upset, uh, over finding this.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I bet.|ba
A|So, uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better.|sd
A|There's, uh, more people involved,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|more than one adult they,|sd
A|and the age groups are separated Uh-huh.|sd
B|Well, nannies have been an option, uh,|sd
B|but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like maybe in, uh, preschool would have where they have lessons and, so forth, and so on.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|story time, uh,|^2
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the, this one has been particularly nice.|sd
A|It, uh, it kept track of what they did,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they would tell the parents what they did that day.|sd
A|You know, if they said anything or did anything.|sd
A|So it kind of kept them,|sd
B|Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,  uh, on  people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,|sv
A|if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.|sv
B|Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,|sv
A|They may not say anything.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.|sv
B|You can't really.|aa
B|You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and usually they aren't at that age. Uh-huh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and decide.|sv
B|Well, I know I, uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children. And, uh, you know, I, I wondered if I would have to be certified|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or whether they'd just bring them|sd
B|and and we got to where, well, we were just friends|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And then if there was a problem|sd
B|and then we'd sit down, and talk about it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it never happened, to be a problem,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and so things worked out okay,|sd
B|and their kids played with my kids|sd
B|and it worked out well.|sd
A|it worked out good.|bf
A|I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Since they'll be going back at the end of the month.|sd
A|And so, I'm going to give it a try.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and I've got that worked out.|sd
A|My husband, he's retired|sd
A|so he's going to deliver my products|sd
A|so I'll do my orders and that by phone.|sd
B|Well, that will be great.|ba
A|So, um, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I I think I'll enjoy doing ,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I think I'll enjoy.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something|sd
B|Sure,|ba
B|why not. That's right.|bh
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Right.|aa
A|That's right|aa
A|Well, they do say you enjoy them more,|sv
A|a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first|sd
B|Well, uh, my husband's mother lives right over here,|sd
B|and she takes care of them sometimes, for me,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and just is a lovely lady,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|My daughter, always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.|sd
B|And,|%
B|Oh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first|sv
