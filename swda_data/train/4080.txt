A|Coming from Texas you're probably,|qy^d

B|Right.|b
A|and it's just, you never know who is out there.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know it's just for self protection purposes|sd

A|my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit,|sd

B|One for a total ban and, uh,|^2
A|That's right.|aa
A|I guess I am about eight or nine|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree with you there|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|I, you know,  I'm not  for it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|if there's  if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know that|sd
A|they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they actually, uh,|sd
A|I know it's this way in Florida.|sd
A|They have a waiting period where you buy one|sd
A|and that's a week|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.|sd
A|I think that's a pretty good idea.|sd
A|Uh, and that's,|%

A|You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.|qh
B|Sure.|b
A|You know, you might do the same thing.|sv
