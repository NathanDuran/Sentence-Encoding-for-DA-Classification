A|And, and, uh, then an uncle is dead.|sd
A|So the, the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Are you all located in Texas?|qy
A|Uh, yeah.|ny
A|We are in, we are all, uh,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, you know, we have, uh, well,|%
B|we all got together,|sd
B|it was about two years ago for,|sd
B|I was,|%

A|French reunion?|qy^d

B|So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|It was kind of fun.|sd
B|But, uh, but who was it?|^h
B|A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago|sd
B|and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.|sd
B|And it really sounded like it was fun.|sd
B|But, I am not quite sure what I would do.|sd
B|I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace, and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know. And have different areas to explore and things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So that would be kind of fun.|sd
B|Yep.|b
B|Where nobody lives|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|And they do not have to clean up afterwards.|sd
B|Yep.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|That is for sure.|ba
B|The cleaning up can be a mess.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But uh, do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm?|qy
A|I am, I am sorry?|br
B|Does, does your dad have horses there?|qy
A|Uh, no,|nn
A|he does not really have any, any, uh, uh, domestic livestock anyway.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, he leased, uh, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.|sd
B|I see,|bk
B|so it's,|%
B|so he really does use it as a vacation home.|qy^d
B|It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.|sv
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Pretty much.|sd
A|He has a garden and, uh, a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, that sounds nice.|ba
B|Do people actually pick the fruit and things?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|And then there is wild blackberries there too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, used to, we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property,|sd
A|he gets,|%
B|but we never got enough.|sd
B|I used to make jam,|sd
B|but I never had enough to really make, you know, more than a jar or something.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So it was not so worth it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Depends on the rain.|sd
B|That sounds,|ba
B|is,|%
B|does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there?|qy
A|Uh,|%
A|it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.|na
B|Well, that is pretty big|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do not know how they do scale down there.|sd
B|You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because they,|%
B|is|%
B|this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres. As opposed to tens of acres.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh,|%
A|and most of it, you know,|%
A|you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We kind of have a, an informal contest.|sd
A|My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago.|sd
A|Well, he put some crappie too.|sd
A|But the bass,|sd
A|we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they are in there, but they are real spooky.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think my dad put some.|sd
B|We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.|sd
B|And,|%
B|I mean really little.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,|sd
B|and there were too many little goldfish,|sd
B|and so the big ones never got bigger.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again|sd
A|Never saw the bass?|qy^d
B|No.|nn
A|Oh.|bk
B|So we do not know whether it is living|sd
B|or,|%
A|Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.|sv
B|Yep.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|We still have lots of little goldfish.|sd
B|They propagate pretty well, those little fish.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah,|b
A|they really do.|sd
B|because we started,|%
B|we have got hundreds in there now,|sd
B|and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know, no matter how many it was for a dollar.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.|sd
A|Oh,|b
B|And,|%
A|yeah.|b
B|It,|%
A|They|%
A|there is a, uh,|%
A|you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.|ad
A|I do not know if they would live very well up in New York,|sd
A|but they get huge.|sd
A|And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, yeah.|b
B|We could see.|sd
B|I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way.|sd
B|But catfish do, I think.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, that,|%
B|you mean,|%
B|well, we could try it.|sd
B|That is a good idea.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh,|sd
B|I forget,|^h
B|there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.|sd
B|And it was really funny,|sd
B|because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond,|sd
B|and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.|sd
B|And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond|sd
B|And that night he came out, and the trap was gone.|sd
B|And it was a raccoon that had taken it.|sd
B|So it was really funny.|sd
B|And you could see that, you know,|sd
B|you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|That is what happens|sd
B|But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?|qy
A|Yeah|ny
A|And, uh, we feed the catfish.|sd
A|They feed the catfish like, uh, every couple of weeks.|sd
A|And, uh, and sometimes that is the best time to catch them.|sd
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Because they will just, they will just come after anything then.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you could catch a couple anyway during that time.|sd
B|What do you feed them?|qw
A|Uh, mixed Purina, uh,|sd
A|it is, uh, cat food, uh, catfish food.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|And it is especially made for catfish.|qy^d
A|But,|%
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know, it is, uh, it looks like Purina High Pro.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|That is funny.|ba
A|But they come up to the top.|sd
A|And it is the best time to take pictures,|sd
A|because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.|sd
A|And they're,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I have never seen catfish, you know, except in filleted on a plate, I think maybe.|sd
B|I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I have never seen them, just alive someplace.|sd
B|That would be fun to see.|sd
A|Well, they are really funny fish.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they try to hit you with their tails.|sd
B|How big do they get?|qw
A|Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh,|sd
A|I think the world record is fifty some pounds.|sd
A|Uh,|%
B|Do you know?|qy
A|that, that is only about three and a half feet long.|sd
B|That is pretty big though.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|they get real fat.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, from the time,|%
A|they, they stay slender until they get to be, uh, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing|sd
A|And I think that was when she was three.|sd
A|And she caught a catfish by accident.|sd
A|She was fishing for sunfish.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she said, "Here," and she handed me her rod and reel|sd
A|And, and, uh, you know, it was just pulling drag out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That sounds amazing.|ba
B|I will have to see them sometime.|oo_co_cc
B|But, all righty.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
