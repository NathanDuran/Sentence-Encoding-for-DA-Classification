A|Uh,|b
B|or,|%

B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|I think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance.|sv
A|Like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, really quickly,  on  regular stations.|sd
B|Well,|%
B|on commercial radio, I guess, I, I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,  or evening on the way  to school|sd
A|Yeah,|b

A|uh-huh.|b
B|so, So, I don't, uh, I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school,|sd

A|But, uh, I'm a news reporter|sd
A|so I, I should get all I can , my news from the from the T V.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|But, um,|%
B|I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play,  and  listen,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|but, uh,|%
A|I usually don't intentionally. Although I should, I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news.|sd
A|If it comes on, I just happen to hear it.|sd
A|Now, I will intentionally buy a newspaper to to, in to look at the news.|sd
A|But  other,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|That's about it.|sd
B|That's about it,|sd
B|yeah.|%
A|The Sunday paper, it's so full of stuff,|sd
A|but you pick your favorite section,|sv
A|and the rest,  you  throw away.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it|sd
A|but,|%
B|I like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, I don't know, it's variety,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour .|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it usually is.|sd
B|They throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries.|sd
B|It's kind of like getting a newspaper.|sv
B|There's a lot of sections to it|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|and they, they present different sides of things.|sd
A|Um.|b
A|Because I find like on K R L D,|sd
A|I like to listen to that,|sd
A|but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.|sd
B|Oh, well they spend a little more time, you know,|sd
B|they cover the headlines,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and,  interviewing people.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that would probably be better.|sd
B|And it's,|%
A|Especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|They have little, little, teeny-weeny news, breaks, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|and only in the morning, I guess, there's a little bit.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|basically.|sd
B|I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So,|%
A|So let's see, um,|^h
B|And I guess I get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things|sd
B|but,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh,|b
B|Right|b
B|Yeah,|b
A|But, um,|%
B|a lot  of people are.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|trying to get out of wherever they are|sv
A|but, um, I think, I think news is,|sv
A|I'm wondering where it's going.|sd
A|You know how,|%
A|I think it will be pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper.|sv
A|I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news.|sd
A|And now, it's, it's kind of your final choice.|sv
A|You watch,|sv
A|first you go to C N N, then you go to radio or something like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|where nobody wants,  to sit down and  read.|sv
A|And I think it,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|It's, it takes a lot more time to read something,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  you've got news,  bombarding you from everywhere  now.|sd
A|So much more effort.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You  know you,  turn  on the T V, turn on the radio.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.|sv
B|Why is that?|qw
A|I don't,|%
A|well, just because I'm, I'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio.|sv
A|You still, you have two or three,|sd
A|I know in Dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations.|sd
A|And then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I just,|%
A|And I just, I just see that dwindling in, in,|sv
B|I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, I mean, just given the way society is.|sv
B|And I enjoy reading,|sd
B|but most people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and,  flip through the channels, you  know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,|sv
A|True,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|True.|aa
A|That's true, too,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper.|^2
B|Right.|aa
B|And they don't have to go get one, you know.|sv
A|One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed in to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it.|sv
A|That's all you have time for.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Whereas in the paper, I like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio because they get on one of these little things,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they give you headlines that are brief,|sd
B|just,|%
B|they touch on what's going on.|sd
B|And then they'll get into something and really explore it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And it's, it's informative.|sv
B|It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|because that's what we do.|sd
A|I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.|sd
A|So, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think.|sv
A|I don't know.|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|there's so much going on in the world.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Communication, you know, expands the world now.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|There's too much going on.|sv
B|You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.|sv
A|I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news,|sv
A|and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.|sd
B|And the question is, how much of it or how, some of it,|qh
B|I guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Is it, is it the true story|qh
B|or is it a little bit biased.|qrr
A|Yeah.|b
A|Because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they could tell us.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know.|qh
A|So that, that was pretty scary.|sd
A|But we,|%
A|I talked to one woman,|sd
A|and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on.|sd
A|And at the same time, I talked to another woman,|sd
A|and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam.|sd
A|And she didn't know what was happening at that time.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And she was so happy to get the information, you know.|sd
A|So there's just a lot of different opinions on that.|sd
A|But,|%
B|I, I, you know, I like to, to know what's going on.|sd
B|Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know you get in the habit of, like I say, turn on Headline News|sv
B|and it will play over and over|sd
B|and you just tune it out because it's the same thing|sv
B|but,|%
A|And then, too, a lot of times I think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they tend to,  dramatize  things.|sv
A|Like,|%
A|You know, like this Kennedy thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|like a It's just, I mean, everywhere you turn.|sv
A|Kennedy,|sd
A|Kennedy,|sd
A|Kennedy.|sd
A|You know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night?|sd
A|And you know, it's just like, okay, this is  ridiculous.|sd
B|Like who cares?|qh
B|Really.|b
A|So,|%
B|Well,|%
A|But what are you doing?|qw
A|Sitting on a computer?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|I heard the little clicking.|sd
B|Trying to do some C programming.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
