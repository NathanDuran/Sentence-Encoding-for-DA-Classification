A|and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here|sd
A|and they lost again.|sd
A|That was pretty pitiful,|ba
A|but they seem to be doing pretty good this year.|sv
B|Well, I was from Illinois originally,|sd
B|and I grew up a Bear fan.|sd
B|And, uh, then we moved here|sd

A|Oh.|b
B|And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger Staubach .|sd

A|I never|%
A|my father was a football fan my whole life|sd
A|and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff|sd
A|and I just hated it.|sd
A|And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football|sd
A|and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend.|sd
A|I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football.|sd

A|I just, I love it.|sd
A|It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport.|sv
A|And, uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet.|sd
A|We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet.|sd
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, it takes a little brainwashing first.|sv
A|Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's even harder.|sd
A|But,|%
B|Are you, uh, transit usually?|qy
B|I mean do you stay not in one place too long?|qy

A|Oh.|b
A|Well, I tell you this,|^h
A|the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, you know,|sd
A|and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, you know, there's snow|sd

B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right, you know|aa
B|he was one of ours, one of our boys.|sd

A|Which is good.|sv
A|Yeah.|%
A|But, uh, I,|%
A|you know, it's funny|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|they|%
A|I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado.|sd
