B|and, uh, I enjoy camping.|sd
B|I,|%
B|we we have a tent,|sd
B|and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,|sd
B|I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death|sd
B|We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.|sd
B|Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,|sd
B|we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April is when we went,|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|and, and it got really cold at night,|sd
B|and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning,|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|but,|%
A|Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?|qw
B|Oh, we take little nature hikes|sd
B|and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.|sd
B|Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
A|I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and so we used to go camping,|sd
A|my dad would take us,|sd
A|there was, there was four of us kids,|sd
A|we'd, he'd take us,|sd
A|and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,|sd
A|and it was always fun, uh,|sd
A|because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot|sd
A|and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,|sd
A|and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,|sd
A|and hopefully we'd catch our supper,|sd
A|but we never did|sd
B|Um.|%
A|but it was, it was always fun.|sd
A|We'd always,|sd
A|Mom was always prepared|sd
A|and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,|sd
A|so we always had, something along to eat,|sd
A|but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,|sd
A|and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.|sd
A|Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,|sd
A|I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,|sd
A|and, uh, there's no hills,|sd
A|it's flat,|sd
A|and then I was in high school,|sd
A|and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,|sd
A|but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,|sd
A|but, it, it was always fun.|sd
A|It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, in the hills we, we would do like you you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,|sd
A|and we always, you know,|sd
A|in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,|sd
A|but,|%
B|Uh,|%
A|Go ahead.|ad
B|We used to live in Utah|sd
A|Okay.|b
