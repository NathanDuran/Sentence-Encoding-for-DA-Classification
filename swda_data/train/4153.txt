A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, um, I used to work in a day care center.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I worked in, um, in all the different areas of the day care center|sd
A|and it is, they can be deceiving to people.|sv
A|I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the, the treatment that the children got,|sd
A|and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three, um, centers,  all over,  you know, the, um, city|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they would, um, be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, um, I think you need to make, you know, if you do, do day care centers, you know you should make frequent checks and, um, to check in on them when they're not expecting it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because they do, do things differently when you're not around,|sv
A|so.|%
B|Well that,|%
B|I know|%
B|the things that we kind of looked at is, is you want to see how many teachers you have. And, and how many kids they have and how they break it up.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Because we had, we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It, it was a really good one,|sv
B|and in fact, it worked out for us because my wife, we kind of bartered.|sd
B|My wife did artwork for them|sd
B|and then, you know, so we got our day care free.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they didn't have enough teachers|sd
B|and,|%
A|Well,  this one was set up good.|sv
A|I mean they had two teachers to every room. Um, sometimes three.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they had a good system like so when you walked in, everything looks cool.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough.|sd
A|They did not show them care to these small children who are being left.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, they,|%
A|one time I picked up this little boy who was crying|sd
A|and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other. You know,|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up.|sd
A|And I said, no,|sd
A|this child was crying and needed some comfort, you know,|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|what  is your problem.|^q
A|So, um,|%
B|Did, did they separate them by age group?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|Because I'd think, you know, I think that's one thing that was important.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|They did, they had like, um, the, the crawlers, the babies that didn't walk in one room. The ones that were starting to walk in one room.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then they had like the, um, three, three year olds, upper fours, lower fours, upper fives, lower fives. You know, just like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, they really did separate them well.|sd
B|it sound,|sv
B|yeah,|%
A|It was just  the teachers themselves.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|But,|%
A|yeah,|aa
A|that they're not,|sd
B|Affectionate people  that they're, they're kind of  may be parents  themselves or something.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Their system,|%
A|Right.|aa
A|But their, but their system was, was great|sv
A|but, um, the, you know, the caring just wasn't there.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The one woman that taught that did the babies. I worked with her|sd
A|and she was fabulous.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|She loved them babies,|sd
A|and she loved them and cared for them.|sd
A|But, um, every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and, um, you know, would make me a nervous wreck,|sd
A|so, you know.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, I, I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and, you know, know all the technical stuff,|sv
B|but if they don't reach out and touch the kids, then that doesn't do any good.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|these kids are just in a day care center all day and, uh, with no, any type of emotional, you know, getting love, getting care,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|they're just there. You know. Going through this routine,  which  is lousy.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B||%
B|The other, the other group that we had was kind of interesting.|sd
B|The other one we went to the, it was a husband and wife team|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we knew them from other associations|sd
B|but, uh, it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one,|sv
B|and I think, you know, she would, she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff, you know,|sd
B|but he was actually the more, um, the more, uh, what, demonstrative type. The more loving|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he would, you know, laugh with the kids and play with the kids|sd
B|and and it was kind of interesting to see that, that it was actually the man in the group that, that did that side of it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you don't see that much.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|so they had a really nice balance.|sd
B|We liked that one.|sd
B|In fact, it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something,|sd
A|That's cute.|ba
B|but they also  did, they also did some of the teaching things|sd
B|and then they had, um, you know,|sd
B|obedience, obedience was important.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that has to be with a day care center.|sv
B|And you know so they,  you know, they used, uh, oh, I think they used the,|sd
B|you probably heard where, you know, where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself.|qy^d
A|I've never heard of that.|ng
A|That's, that's a new one,  on me.|sd
B|And it's, it's one,|%
B|Uh, I can't remember what they call it actually|sd
B|but you just stand them in front of a clock|sd
B|and, you know, it has a second-hand that goes around.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they have to stand there,|sd
