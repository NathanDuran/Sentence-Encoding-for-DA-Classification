B|I don't complain weather wise though, because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning,|sd
B|and the high was only fifty,|sd
B|and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon|sd
A|Ooh.|b
B|so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies.|sd

B|so. I have in Michigan,|sd
B|but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow|sd
B|and life goes on.|sd
A|You're right.|aa
B|So, as I understand it here, if there's anything, they'll call off schools and, and close businesses.|sd
