A|Okay, Diane.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|And a very good afternoon to you.|fp
B|And good afternoon to you.|fp
A|Do you, uh, do most of your cooking at home|qy
A|or do you, uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?|qrr
B|Um, no.|nn
B|I do most of my cooking at home|sd
B|and, um, I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner party.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|My goodness|ba
A|Well, what would you, uh, like to cook?|qy
A|What's, what, what's, what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to have for a dinner party?|qw
B|Um,|b
A|Now you're in Dallas, is it?|qy
B|Right,|na
B|I'm in Dallas.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues|sd
B|And,|%
A|I was, I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost, Tex-Mex.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, Tex-Mex, uh,|b^m
B|Mexican food, um probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's a very interesting food though|sd
A|and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|We have, uh,|%
A|I think Chico's|%
A|or, or in these different restaurants in this area that, uh, have all this fine Mexican foods.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, um, if I were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard to you|sd
A|but, uh, actually I never get too much fried chicken.|sd
B|Fried chicken.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I love twice cooked potatoes.|sd
B|Oh, yes,|ny
B|I have.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|As you can see, I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal|sd
B|Right|b
A|And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, how would you improve upon that?|qo
B|Oh, improve upon that?|b^m
B|Let's see.|^h
B|I'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in.|sd
B|And some,|%
A|More fresh vegetables?|b^m
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Included to that?|qy
B|Uh, green beans and, uh carrots and things like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|How do you cook your green beans?|qw
B|My green beans?|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Um, I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes.|sd
A|So you|%
B|And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them.|sd
A|All right that's what I was wondering about.|sd
A|What, what you use and, and in herbs and so forth.|bf
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it makes them pretty tasty.|sd
A|Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans?|qy
B|The Chinese type.|b^m
B|Are they the real,|qy
A|We use soy sauce,|sd
B|No,|nn
B|I haven't ever used that.|sd
A|Well, you might, uh, be interested in that.|sv
A|Have,|qy
A|it gives a very delicious taste.|sd
A|You, you have a soy sauce taste|sd
A|and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the, uh, water and,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, golly. What's this white powder that, that, uh, that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce?|qw
B|A white powder.|b^m
A|I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment.|sd
B|Um, gosh.|ba
A|Anyhow|%
A|sorry about my mind.|fa
B|That's okay.|bd
A|But, uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it.|sd
A|If it does|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it, it brings out such a, so much different things in, uh in the string beans.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I like it to try them differently.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you might, uh, think about that.|ad
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I might try that.|aa
A|Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them.|sv
B|Oh, yes.|b
B|I love Chinese.|sd
A|And, uh, north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous.|sd
B|North African?|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's, uh, made from, uh, I think they call it, beans.|sv
A|And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish.|sd
A|You probably have to buy that from specialty stores.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|C o u s, c o u s.|sd
A|And that's a, a north African dish.|sd
A|They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|And it is very very flexible.|sd
A|You can do a lot of things with it.|sd
A|It makes a fantastic, uh, uh, salad with cucumbers and, olive oil and onions|sd
A|and,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, boy,|ba
A|real tasty.|sd
A|Well, I've enjoyed talking with you,|fc
