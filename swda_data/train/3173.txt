A|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next.|ad
B|I think our next car, I would like something like a, an economy car that gets really good mileage and, uh, one that's really reliable.|sd
B|I would, I think probably not a, a brand new car,|sd
B|but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra. Or something like that, uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|something my husband,|%
A|And, of course, it has to have air-conditioning|qy^d
B|Oh, absolutely,|na
B|air-conditioning and a radio, uh, A M, F M and a cassette player|sd
B|and, uh, what else do I want|t1
A|Does it have to be a special color?|qy
B|Uh, I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice.|na
B|You know, a, a navy blue or a,|sd
A|It sounds like something your husband would drive, right?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, I don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one,|sd
A|but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts, of course,|sd
A|and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed|sd
A|and that was kind of iffy,|sd
A|but that made it better economically,|sd
A|so,|%
B|I think that's something we might want, too, is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|We'll probably have to look for another second car sometime|sd
A|and we'd look for about what you're looking for.|sd
A|but probably real cheap, too.|sd
A|It wouldn't be a used, used car,|sd
A|so, but, no|%
B|I think we would want one that, even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that, uh, you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Would you like four doors|qy
A|or doesn't really matter.|qrr
B|well probably, probably that would be a good idea,|na
B|yeah.|ny
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|it, it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|So if we wanted it to take people out it's, that's a good thought.|sd
B|I,|%
B|that hadn't crossed my mind.|sd
A|It would be fun just to win one, wouldn't it|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I would go for that.|sd
A|That would be great.|ba
A|All right,|fc
A|well, I think that's all that we need to say.|fc
B|Well, thank you for calling.|fc
A|All right,|fc
A|we'll talk to you later.|fc
B|All right.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
