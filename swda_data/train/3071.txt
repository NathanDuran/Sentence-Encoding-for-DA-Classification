A|and now I've, for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here, in Texas.|sd

A|yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|Um, MADAM BUTTERFLY was, um, in Dallas,|sd
A|it's been two or three years ago now,|sd

A|and, it was really wonderful.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was particularly well,|sd
A|the acting was particularly nice, I thought,|sd
A|and, um, so, it was quite popular.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, you don't play, um, an instrument|sd
A|so, uh, um, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or|qy
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, you know, some other kind of instrument,|sv
A|I think piano is always good background,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|beginner.|%
A|Um, I played piano all through, well, I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college,|sd
A|and, uh, then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school,|sd
A|so, um, that was the instrument both of my children started on,|sd
A|but neither of them stayed with it|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|One of them, um, turned into a violist,|sd
A|and the other one is, the boy is, um, guitar and, and percussion,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but the,|%
A|I, I think that the piano background is very, um, useful,|sv
A|and, um, I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself, just for practicing and so on.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you have any other kind of music that you like?|qy
B|Um, oh, I like to listen to all different kinds of music.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have a,|%
A|I used to work with a fellow who had, um,|sd
A|although this was a computer company, he had his, uh, P H D in musical, uh, I guess it was in composition, actually, from University of North Texas,|sd
A|and, uh, yet when I would go into his, his office every now and then, you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio|sd
A|It may be country,|sd
A|it might be classical,|sd
A|it might be rock, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|And that was, that was neat for, for me to hear that somebody is,|sd
B|There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like|sd
B|but,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Um, do you have any plans to, uh, do anything with your music in the near future|qy
A|or,|%
B|Well, I have, I have like, we,|sd
B|I wish I could|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I, I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree|sd
B|or,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|um|%
A|I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing,|sd
A|I'm not sure where, you are in Texas,|sd
A|but I do know that some communities have, uh, community choruses|sd
A|and, uh, that's often a good way to get back into it again.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's not terribly demanding.|sv
A|You might have to audition,|sd
A|but that probably wouldn't be a problem,|sv
A|but, um, there usually, you know,|sd
A|that they take tours and things like that|sd
A|and you get to know you know, people socially as well as, as in a musical setting,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that's always fun.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's, well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music,|sd
A|but we've gotten to know each other quite well, um, in, on a, a social level,|sd
A|and, and I think we sing better because of that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think, you know, I think we sing more like, uh, people who trust each other which is really nice.|sd
B|That's good.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That often is the case, um,|sv

A|it's, it, sometimes it will skip.|sv
A|Like my husband is not musical at all,|sd
A|but his mother is very musical,|sd
A|and, um, and his children are very musical,|sd
A|so you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.|sv
A|So, um, well, I'm not sure how long we've talked.|sd
B|I think,|%
A|I haven't paid, haven't been paying attention to the, to the clock.|sd
