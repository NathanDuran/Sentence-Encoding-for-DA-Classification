A|Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets  there at your home?|qy
B|Yeah, I do.|ny
A|And what kind do you have?|qw
B|I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.|sd
B|I live alone in an apartment,  and, uh,  except for the cat.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, we have a cat, um,|sd
A|he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?|qw
B|Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,|sd
B|so  he's an indoor cat,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.|sd
B|How about yours?|qo
A|Well, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|He's, uh, been so mean to her|sd
B|And, and you say you've had him how long?|qw^d
A|We've had him for about two years|sd
B|Two years.|b^m
A|and he was so mean to her, um, right after we first got him.|sd
A|So we had him neutered, and, and declawed,|sd
A|and now he bites her.|sd
A|He can't scratch her any more,|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|he bites her.|sd
B|Does he bite her enough to draw blood?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|he has a couple of times,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But he's a very possessive cat.|sd
A|He, he loves my son,|sd
A|it's his cat,|sd
A|and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and he's so funny,|sd
A|he just follows my son around just like a dog.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|He won't even let my son shower.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|He meows and wants to get in the bathroom|sd
A|and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.|sd
A|So he's quite a animal|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|boy,|ba
B|I guess.|sv
B|Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|b
A|but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,|sd
A|and we do keep our daughter away from him.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house|sd
B|Is that the only pet that you have?|qy
A|It is,|na
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.|sd
A|Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home.|sd
A|So, we gave him up and tried.|sd
B|Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh,|ny
A|we're in a house,|sd
A|but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|we couldn't allow him to run free,|sd
A|so, he was just chained up all the time,|sd
A|and it was,  it was  unfortunate.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|So have you tried any other pets?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|no.|nn
B|I, I live alone in an apartment,|sd
B|and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh|sd
A|Oh|b
B|although I've heard rabbits are pretty good|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, my word.|ba
B|and they apparently, uh,|sd
B|especially when they're young when they bring them in|sd
A|Oh, my word.|ba
B|uh,|%
A|And do they, they just paper train it or something?|qy
B|I guess.|na
B|I guess,|na
B|yeah,|%
B|and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, rabbits are darling.|sv
A|That would be fun if you could get them trained.|sv
A|Otherwise they're pretty smelly|sv
B|Yep,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|Oh.|%
B|Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, uh,|qy
A|Huh-uh,|nn
A|we don't have C, we don't have cable.|sd

B|and they had that on last week,|sd
B|and that's really  kind of something  to watch, uh,|sv
A|Oh.|%
