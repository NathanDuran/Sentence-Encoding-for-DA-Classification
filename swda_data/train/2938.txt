A|Oh, well, no|%
A|I'm from the north,|sd
A|that's why I said we, in Kentucky, we,|sd

A|you just get used to the weather,|sv

A|and, uh, it just,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|I just laugh|sd
A|every time they have a, every time they have snow, on the ground everything's closed up.|sd

B|Do you all have much pollution there?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|not really,|sd

B|and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe.|sd
A|Well, see, they have that, um, what is it a test, or something like that they call it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,  that's supposed to cut down on it.|sv
B|Well,|arp_nd
B|supposedly that's supposed to catch it.|sv

B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|And, uh, it, it gets bad.|sv
B|Well, you know what they've started doing is, is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that way it gets above, um, other cars on the road|sd
A|Well, that's a good idea.|sv
B|and, uh, it really does make a difference, although it, it settles, you know,|sv
B|even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out, it still settles,|sd
B|and, and, you know, if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road, that's, that's even more miserable.|sv
