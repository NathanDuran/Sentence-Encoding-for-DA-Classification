A|Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel,|ad
A|and then I'll respond.|sd
B|All right.|aa
B|Well, I'm, uh, I'm very guilty of, of not doing my part with recycling, I'm afraid.|sd
B|We, um, recently moved here from North Carolina,|sd
B|and they had curbside recycling,|sd
B|and it was very easy to, you know, to put everything out there,|sd
B|but we don't have it in, at least in our neighborhood right now|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, so, I've been very guilty about not making the effort to, to take things where take things where they belong.|sd
A|Well, how long have you been here?|qw
B|Well, we've been here since January,|sd
B|so we, we still feel very new,|sd
A|Well,|%
B|but, uh it's working up to a year now,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, I guess we're old timers compared to some people.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think that's a good excuse.|sv
A|You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|We've been here probably two and a half years,|sd
A|and, and we didn't recycle at all before we came|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I think we're doing well.|sd
A|We, we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, where do you take those things?|qw
A|Well, the, um, glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart.|sd
A|They have, um, in behind Walmart they have bins|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we usually save up our cans and, and change them in for money.|sd
B|Well, where do you do that,|qw
B|because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I didn't know where to take them.|sd
A|Um, there's a place on Parker Road, um,|sd
A|it's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart.|sd
A|I think there's a, a service station there.|sd
A|There's usually a semi truck that has a, a person there that will weigh them|sd
A|and, Now they aren't worth much right now,|sv
B|Oh.|bk
A|but it's better than nothing|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so|%
B|Better than nothing,|b^m
B|right.|aa
A|and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the, the pickup now,|sd
A|and we, hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I,|%
B|it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that, you know it's coming in a couple of months,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and, I think it's been delayed.|sd
B|but|%
A|I think it was originally scheduled for February,|sd
A|but the trucks that were supposed to do it, there's been some problems with from what I've read in, you know, the mail that we get|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|and I can't wait for that,|sd
A|that will be easy.|sv
A|I get tired of newspaper littering the garage|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it gets to be a bit much to haul it off,|sv
B|but.|%
A|I feel guilty we don't recycle our, our milk containers because they seem like a big waste.|sv
B|Well, they, yeah they, they're a lot of bulk, anyway|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|yeah.|b
A|yeah,|b
A|they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can|sd
B|Right.|b
A|so, I'll be glad when the bins do come,|sd
A|and I think that's when I'll, I'll start doing the plastic, too.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it was real easy with the bins,|sd
B|it really was,|sd
B|it was just no effort at all, um, no more trouble than taking out the garbage,|sd
B|so, um,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|I've gotten used to washing the, you know, the, um, salad dressing bottles and things like that,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|it's not that big of a deal,|sv
A|and it's nicer to just throw them out,|sv
A|but we can do our part take an extra minute or two.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, how much do you earn on the cans,|qw
B|I, I didn't know what kind of an idea to give her for,|sd
A|Oh, when we first were, were here, it was like we'd take maybe a, oh, a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|So it's gone down.|bf
A|Yeah|aa
B|Yeah,|b^m
A|which is understandable,|sv
A|I think, more people are are recycling.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's something we, we don't really make any effort to,|sd
A|and whatever pop we drink, we used to take the boys out for a bike ride, and pick up the litter, you know, the, the cans|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that was kind of fun,|sd
A|but we haven't done that for a long time|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
B|Well, that sounds like a pretty good project.|ba
A|Well, the boys think it's fun, plus you get your exercise|sd
A|and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest|sd
A|so|%
B|Oh.|b
A|but.|%
B|Well, I'll have to keep myself and, and get on it.|sd
B|My neighbor across the street, um, is so careful about recycling,|sd
B|and so I keep telling myself, I'll, I'll get it organized,|sd
B|but, may, maybe they'll beat me and, and do the city wide first.|sv
A|Well, hopefully the bins will be here in this month|sd
A|and that will spur you on,|sv
A|so|%
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|I won't have any excuse then,|sv
B|that's for sure.|sv
A|All right, well, it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting, Trying|sv
B|Thinking about it, anyway|^2
