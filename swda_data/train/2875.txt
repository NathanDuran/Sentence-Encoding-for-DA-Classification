B|Uh, we found some guys that actually, you know, worked for a Mercedes dealership|sd
B|and, uh, they also repair them for other the people on their off time so have, we, we have redone that thing from stem to stern, I mean inside, outside, you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it, so, you know, I really haven't thought much past that it seems like, you know,|sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again, you know.|sd
A|Was you,|%
A|why they, they didn't,|sd

B|Maybe not.|aap_am
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
B|I, I don't know it just seems like, uh, you know, for what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more, than, you know,|sd
A|Oh, sure,|aa
A|a restored, vehicle is, is great, I think, certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good.|sv
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|right,|aa
B|we, the one thing that, uh, we did decide as, it's, it's,|sd
B|we wanted it to be as authentic as possible|sd
B|but we did break down and put a C D player in it,|sd
A|Well, that's great.|ba
B|that's not quite authentic,|sd
B|but at any rate that, that was one thing that I, one of the features that I did want,|sd
B|I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it,|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|you all, done a lot more,|sv
B|I had to stop there.|sd
A|when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, of course, we do it ourselves|sd
B|but, like I said, we were just lucky to find these guys that do it, you know,|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|they're, they just weren't really expensive,|sd
A|Oh, that is good, acknowledgeable people.|ba
B|and, uh, yeah, you know,|aa

B|it was an eighty-two Cougar,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I think it just soured me on it for some reason because I had trouble with it starting,|sd
B|the engine blew up in it,|sd
B|I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so, you know, I, I thought what the heck, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|we'll try something different|^q
B|so.|%
A|Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, I do like the V Eight engines|sd
A|and I think the,|sv
A|I went to the auto show with my daughter recently, down in Dallas|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, I, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines, right now, I mean,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Really.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|right,|b
A|I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago.|sd
B|yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I would that that there's,|sd
B|I see a marked improvement, you know, as far as, uh, what I've heard about performance and such, you know, so, uh, uh, hopefully it'll stay that way, I mean, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
B|I'd, I'd, I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
B|but, uh, I think,|%
A|I,|%
A|uh, you know, they said, they said what do we want to buy,|sd
A|I, I'm, uh, not seriously thinking|sd
A|but I, I would like to, put it in that category, uh, by a Cadillac|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|but I wouldn't, buy a new one|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|but, uh, I do look for a one year old vehicle, with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|twenty thousand,|b^m
B|yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Well, that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks.|sd
B|They had, uh,|%
B|and I think my, my mother drives the SeVille now that's, uh, I guess it's a couple of years old,|sd
B|and, uh, she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was, that was so, uh,|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|I remember those.|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|and she, it final just wore out|sd
B|they had, they had purchased it,|sd
B|I don't, can't remember how many years they had that car,|sd
B|but she loved the styling of it.|sd
A|That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore.|sv
B|No,|ar
B|she sold it|sd
B|and she,|%
A|That,|%
A|since they don't make them anymore, she, that could be turned into a classic, in, in ten, fifteen years, uh.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I know.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|she kept telling herself that|sd
B|and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well, just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it,|sd
B|I mean he came back with a new car|sd
A|No,|b
A|he wanted new one ,|bf
A|yeah,|b
A|right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think he had an ulterior motive|sd
B|he could just see, you know, dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went|sd
B|but, uh, they, they really are nice cars, there, there,|sd
A|I'm still a full size person,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I like a full size Cadillac,|sd
A|I, I want one of those,|sd
A|I think they are, I don't know, a classic|sd
A|but they're, certainly not,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they haven't changed in about, uh, twenty years,|sd
A|and, and they'll eventually phase them out|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and I sure would like one ever those, uh, uh, within the next five years, or so.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again, you know,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|they had, they've scaled everything down so much|sd
B|and, uh, I have, I don't, I've never owned a really large car,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had|sd
B|and,|%
A|Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|Yeah,|b
A|I've never had a|sd
B|now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, you know.|sv
A|I've never had, a Japanese car,|sd
A|I, I've had friends who had them,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think they're a lot over|sv
A|and they're is just no styling to them,|sv
A|you can't tell one Japanese car from the other, because they all a like,|sv
B|That's true,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|you know, I don't mean that as a joke,|sd
A|I mean, they really all look a like,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and the|%
A|I don't have any idea what, which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is,|sd
B|What is what,|bf
B|yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and I think they have not, uh, lead the field in styling,|sv
A|they do have sports cars|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but the price is way more,|sd
A|you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|it's ridiculous now.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I know that, uh,|sd
B|I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess it just, uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape.|sd
B|I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal|sd
B|and she, she's had, she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it|sd
B|and that's what she's going to buy again|sd
B|and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got|sd
B|and, so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show.|ad
A|I, I look at the Cadillacs|sd
A|and boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't even realize they made|sd
A|but they were, just styled so differently,|sd
B|Really.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|they were standard Cadillacs|sd
A|but they really looked beautiful.|sd
B|Are they still,|qy
B|are what they're,|qy
B|what they have out for like the next year, is everything still pretty square,|qy
B|it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance .|sv
A|Oh, no,|nn
A|they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they have that new, uh,|sd
A|it's not the big, uh, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|there's another one that has came out in the last two year, not the Seville,|sd
A|the Seville is totally different,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.|sd
B|Now when, when was this,|qw
B|was this recently?|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|it was a month or so ago.|sd
B|Oh, okay,|bk
B|because I have,|%
A|Well, they have it every year.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair|sd
B|and that's usually when I see anything, you know.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|now this was, uh, in it was downtown in the, uh, Convention Center|sd
A|and, they had all the cars|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|they had Japanese and German cars,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|they had the full range ,|sd
A|and they had some, they had some new cars that weren't even out|sd
A|they had, uh, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, you know,|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|that big, big one that was, uh,|sd
A|they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it had a microwave in it and everything,|sd
B|Oh, my word.|ba
A|it was,|%
A|they had several futuristic cars.|sd
B|That's wild, you know,|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|you hear about things like that|sd
B|and you think that can't possibly be done,|sv
B|I mean, it just, that's just too weird.|sv
A|I know.|aa
A|And I like engines|sd
A|they had a lot of broken down not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, uh, displayed engines, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|so you could tell,|bf
B|see the inside of them or whatever.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, you know,|sd
A|I mean, certainly interested in buying a new car|sd
A|but again the, yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|well, maybe,|aap_am
A|and, uh, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while * spelling "think"?|sv
B|somebody's finally woken up, you know.|sv
A|and, I think that, I, I would definitely buy,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|again there's the question are we in the market, uh,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I could buy anything, you know.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|you know, if I could fine, * spelling "find"?|sd
B|I, I was really crazy about Jags for a while|sd
B|and the convertible, had a is it X J S or something like that,|sd
B|and I, you know, thought that's a dream car,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.|sv
A|Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|so, uh,|%
B|yeah.|b
A|I am the kind of engineer|sd
A|and I've always done it myself|sd
A|and, uh I've got three of them|sd
B|Well, that's good that you can.|sv
A|and, uh, I can't remember one,|sd
A|I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time,|sd
B|Oh, really,|b
B|that,|%
B|oh, gosh,|ba
B|that's great.|ba
A|I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on|sd
A|like I said I don't do that you know.|sd
B|I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,|sv
B|my, my husband is, uh, engineer|sd
B|but he cannot, I mean,|sd
B|or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it|sd
B|that's might be part of it,|sd
B|but, uh, you know, we just, I just say forget it we'll just take it in, and get it taken care it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|He drives, drives a Honda.|sd
A|I, I, noticed that when I was a kid, uh,|sd
A|I was wasn't a mechanical engineer|sd
A|but I worked my way through college as a mechanic|sd
A|so,|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
A|I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and now again, I've got three vehicles|sd
A|and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.|sd
B|Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider,|sv
B|see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well, is this engine that I can work on or that, you know, my husband can work on or whatever, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, you're, you're pretty lucky in that respect that,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's when you know,|bf
B|yeah.|b
A|and, in fact, I stock the same part,|sd
A|I'm like a little stock,|sd
A|if you, brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, you knows|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's pretty good,|ba
B|it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car|sd
B|and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything,|sd
A|Oh, that's great,|ba
B|and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, uh, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,|sd
A|I've always wanted to that too.|sd
B|he's gotten these catalogs|sd
B|it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three,|sd
A|Oh, I can imagination,|ba
