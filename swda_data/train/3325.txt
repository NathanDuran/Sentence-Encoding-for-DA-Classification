A|Two cats,|b^m
A|you're lucky.|ba
A|Your two fish.|sd
B|And what do you have?|qw
A|Well, my husband,|%
A|you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.|sv
B|Oh, no.|b
A|My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.|sd
A|So we have a black Labrador.|sd
B|Ooh.|bk
A|Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador,|sd
A|but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the ranch, in the farm|sd
A|and,|%
A|Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room|arp_nd
A|and then he goes out for the day.|sd
A|But this, this is a beautiful dog|sd
A|and he is wonderful with our little girls|sd
A|and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line|sd
A|and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And this is huge.|sd
A|You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,|sd
A|he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,|sd
A|but he does.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now was when he was, uh, about eight months old|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one,|sd
A|and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.|sd
A|And I came home|sd
A|and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.|sd
B|Oh, my word.|ba
A|And it was in the floor|sd
A|and I just about lost it|sd
A|and I called|sd
A|and I said, come home and get your dog.|sd
A|And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me you know,|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum.|sd
A|He kept picking at it|sd
A|and I didn't|sd
A|the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it|sd
A|So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.|sd
A|And I told my husband,|sd
A|I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,|sd
A|and he looked at me like, well, you know|sd
B|Good-bye|^2
A|He loves this dog|sd
A|and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him|sd
A|and he's a good dog,|sd
A|so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to|sd
A|and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.|sd
A|I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet|sd
A|But, I, I grew up with cats|sd
