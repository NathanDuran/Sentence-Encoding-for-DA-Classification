A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I hope you know more about the subject of baseball|sd
A|and where they're going than I do|sd
B|Oh, I know a little bit about it.|sd
B|I'm not a die-hard fan|sd
B|but I, I enjoy the,|sd
B|I like the Boston Red Sox myself.|sd
A|Well, I,|%
A|of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best.|sd
A|However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years,|sd
A|but I have kept, uh, my eye on the Rangers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know|qy
A|and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point,|sd
A|and then they kind of fell on their face|sd
B|Well, with, uh,|%
B|their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Correct,|ba
A|right.|b
B|Right|b
B|Oh, it's amazing.|ba
A|They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know it's just, uh, phenomenal|sd
B|Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.|sd
A|Well, good.|ba
B|Um, I've been really busy at work this past week|sd
B|and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper|sd
B|and, uh,|%
B|so every day I'll have a newspaper at work,|sd
B|and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.|sd
B|But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop|sd
A|I understand.|ba
A|I understand.|ba
B|But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Uh, you are involved with T I uh, speech, um, recognition?|qy
B|Well, not really.|ng
B|I, um I work at laboratory.|sd
A|How did you find out about it?|qw
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|From, uh,|%
B|I'm an officer in the Air Force,|sd
A|I see.|ba
A|Interesting.|ba
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I, at, uh, not in my office|sd
A|I see.|ba
B|but, uh, in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Well, that's interesting.|ba
A|And the topics are interesting, uh,|sd
A|they run a whole gamut of, of, uh, subjects,|sd
A|and, uh, I think we can address every topic,|sv
A|but the depth of knowledge is quite different.|sv
B|Sure.|b
B|Sure.|b
A|So, uh, when they chose baseball,|sd
A|I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand baseball, you know,|sd
A|I don't understand football.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I prefer to,|sd
B|I, I like,|sd
B|I never used to really like watching football that much|sd
B|but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game,|sd
B|but I've always liked baseball.|sd
B|I, I prefer to watch, um,|sd
B|I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.|sv
B|And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game.|sd
A|Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.|sd
A|But I can't relate to football because I've never, played football and, and don't, and have any interest,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football.|sd
A|And, uh, I had four daughters|sd
A|so that wasn't a question,|sd
A|but now I have a grandson that you know, is gung ho for, uh, football.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well,|%
B|Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.|sd
A|I understand that,|ba
B|I'd, I,|%
A|but I think the, they happen more in football.|sv
A|I think the odds are cut down.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.|sv
A|The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage|sv
A|but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.|sv
B|it's true.|aa
B|I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less, troublesome sports,|sv
A|Because|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, for some people it's just, uh, uh,|sd
A|A love for them.|^2
B|Well, that,|%
B|not so much that|ar
B|but, uh, even in baseball you can,|sv
B|like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing the ball because I very, I was always very strong|sd
B|and I|%
B|when I was young I could throw harder, than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I see.|ba
B|And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, having trouble.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, and I was a catcher|sd
B|so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff.|sd
B|So I,|%
B|that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I did that wrestling|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|No,|nn
B|I'd,|%
B|well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things|sd
B|and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.|sd
B|But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like,|sd
B|now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling,|sd
B|but it,|%
B|as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me|sd
B|then playing football this fall, I, it was just flag football too. I separated it again|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it seemed to be, like the straw that broke the camels back,|sd
A|Oh, boy.|ba
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three.|sd
A|It was never set right.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.|sd
A|And, uh, one of the men that was in our on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.|sd
A|And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.|sd
A|And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.|sd
B|My God.|ba
A|So, uh, yeah|b
A|Um, it was really funny, you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, uh, follow through with my, uh,|sd
A|addressing that , to put the ball,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the, uh, pins.|%
A|So that was interesting.|sd
A|So I really, um, I got a lot of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm not sure where all my pins came from,|sd
A|but it's,|%
A|but that was quite awhile ago|sd
A|but I, and I never pursued it.|sd
A|And a lot of people said, well, you should have turned pro.|sd
A|And I thought, no,|sd
A|not|%
A|I don't,|%
A|my love wasn't there for the game.|sd
A|I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment and I, uh, fellowship|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|but outside of that, no.|sd
A|I didn't.|sd
A|And I, and I still, I like to bowl,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't have, uh, Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do|sd
B|Are you on, you on any leagues now?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I'm not.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|No.|nn
A|No, uh,|nn
A|at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement|sd
A|and, uh, it's true bowling|sd
A|and I've never, uh, shared that with them.|sd
A|I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, uh, win a lot of money for the junior achievement, uh, organization.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be to do.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years.|sd
B|I don't know,|h
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|a long time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she still, she's got to be,|sd
A|Still carries a good uh, average?|qy^d
B|Well, no,|nn
B|she|%
