A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|All right.|b
A|Go ahead.|ad
B|Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.|qw^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|I don't know.|no
B|The question is, I mean, would I want to buy,|sd
B|or would I, would I probably actually buy.|sd
B|May be two different things.|sv
A|Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.|qw^d
B|If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.|sv
B|No,|b
B|in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.|no
B|I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche Turbo .|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I maybe would buy a B M W. Uh, or, or even a Volvo.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|What do you have now?|qw
B|I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's actually the first car we ever bought new.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|we just, we, well, I have|%
A|my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah|b
B|me too|sd
B|So what car do you drive?|qw
B|What is it?|qw
A|Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|we almost bought one of those.|sd
B|Do you like it?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I do,|sd
A|and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,|sd
A|and I,|%
A|some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,|sd
A|and mine is a standard|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it had a lot more pickup and everything.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|%
B|Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.|qw
A|Um|b
A|usually AVIS.|sd
B|To what, AVIS?|br
A|AVIS.|na
B|Really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Huh.|b
B|I guess,|%
A|It's just because we're on,|sd
A|I think of it,|%
A|I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,|sd
A|but we have corporate contracts you know, with the various companies|sd
B|I see.|bk
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so it depends on your destination, too.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Kind of strange|sd
B|You work for a big company, then.|qy^d
A|Work for T I. Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this|no
B|T I, I see.|bk
B|Uh-huh. Um,|b
B|but yeah,|b
B|I, I, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Maybe it would,|%
B|one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.|sv
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Um, and it really saved us some big money once.|sd
A|It did, huh.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,|sd
B|and I had to pay twenty five for the,|sd
A|Oh, that was great.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it was.|aa
A|That's unusual to hear,|sv
A|usually, you know something breaks,|sv
A|you look at the warranty|sv
A|and it's excluded.|sv
B|Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.|sd
A|Oh, I see,|b
A|okay.|b
A|Oh, you got your money's worth.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we did,|aa
B|but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,|sd
B|and of course I'm glad I did it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that is good.|ba
B|But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I've been lucky.|sd
A|Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.|sd
B|Bumper?|qy
B|Oh.|bk
A|It didn't actually dent the car or anything.|sd
A|So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,|sd
B|Well, that was good.|ba
A|and the store will pay for it anyway,|sd
B|Are you.|%
A|so. No big deal.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?|qy
A|Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one|ng
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's a Legend|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|those are nice .|sv
A|um, but it's, it's a used one|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,|sd
A|and the fact that, you know, this this car that I have has performed so well,|sd
A|and before that I also had an Accord,|sd
A|it was a real old one|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I bought that used.|sd
A|I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,|sd
A|and it served me real well, too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|my sister drives one.|sd
B|She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it Legend|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's a,|%
B|I'm not certain,|sd
B|but she's liked it. Um,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, I, I have, I have never had,|sd
B|and we,|%
B|in fact, what I'm driving right now,|sd
B|we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,|sd
B|and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo just to be a little, you know, little car that I could care less about|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|How did it go for you?|qw
B|Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.|sd
A|Hasn't left you stranded.|qy^d
B|I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,|no
B|it's just a, it's a cheap little little car just to go, you know, run around town in|sd
A|Yeah|aa
A|I know.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive.|sd
B|I, I,|%
B|you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know|sd
A|Really.|b
B|it's like too, too mushy,|sd
B|and it, you know it's an automatic,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and|%
A|Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend|sd
B|it's too,|%
B|the steering|%
A|it's windy.|^2
B|you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,|sd
B|it's kind of,|%
A|I can't drive that,|sd
A|the Legend, it's just so huge.|sd
