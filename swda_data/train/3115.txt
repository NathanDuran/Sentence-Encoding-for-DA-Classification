A|All right|b
A|and, and your occupation is teaching?|qy^d
B|I'm a, I'm a substitute teacher.|na
A|Substitute teacher.|b^m
B|Is, is this Pat I'm talking to now?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|it is, it is.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm a substitute teacher, in, I believe, the same school system we both work in.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, I was just trying to make an introduction, here|ad
B|Oh, okay.|aa
A|But, oh, and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year, now.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|I've just gotten a, another job at an elementary library at Barron.|sd
B|Well, I bet you're, you're, you may dress differently, then, for that.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I,|%
A|well, not really.|arp_nd
A|I've got the, every day I've got to, uh, read to kindergartners,|sd
A|so I'm going to be down on the floor with them.|sd
A|I've got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be doing, working with every day for, uh, you know, a half hour.|sd
A|So I'll be, I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because I'm, I'm, if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them, I'm not going to wear nylons and, you know nice nylons and dresses.|sd
B|Well, What I wear sometimes depends on, on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I'm a sub, and have different rooms to go to. And always carry a sweater.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|But, you don't know, uh, I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|you try to layer, so you can add or, or or take off.|sd
A|Subtract.|^2
A|Right.|b
B|And it's, it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual, uh,|sd
A|I, I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools.|sd
A|That's one of things, one of the things I ask about, you know, whether, whether she would allow slacks|sd
A|and she said she doesn't have a problem with that,|sd
A|she just didn't like sloppy dressing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and I said, well, you know, that was okay.|sd
A|And I'm,|%
A|basically, I just, you know, I wear slacks year round except every, about once a week I try to wear a skirt.|sd
A|And, and in the winter, you know, I just add a, maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer. And add a heavier jacket or, you know, wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's about,|%
A|I don't, I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and, you know, look really,|sd
B|Right,|b
B|and, well, for me sometimes, they even have dress up days|sd
B|or they, you know, have, have spirit week that, that you wear your different outfits|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and you have to have the color for that particular school if you, if you choose to participate in spirit week.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat.|sd
A|And you never know that, though sometimes when you're going in, do you?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|but because I sort of stick to several schools, uh, I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and, and might, might remember to do it.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And then many schools on a particular day during, uh, I guess football season, maybe all year long, they wear the school colors for, uh, game day which,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|On what, Thursday.|^2
B|Right,|b
B|it might be Thursday for the high schools|sd
B|and it may be Friday for the senior high schools.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
A|So that would kind of give you a, a clue, I guess|sd
A|and, and sometimes you get the long term stuff|sd
A|so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That,|%
A|so that's,|%
A|and I don't know, you know,|h
A|I, I think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know.|sd
A|Are|%
A|they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say they have to, the men have to wear ties|sd
A|and there can be no blue jeans worn|sd
A|and, because some of the teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.|sd
A|And, and, uh, I don't know that that looks that bad.|sd
A|But, if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up, I guess you can tell the teachers that, too.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|it, it,|%
B|I see that the,|sd
B|I think the elementary school teachers, or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than, than some of the high school teachers, I think.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it, I think it varies, it, it just so much.|sd
B|Anything, anything can go.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools, like history at Clark, they're all pretty fancy.|sd
B|But they're just sort of into clothes,|sd
B|and then there's other departments that aren't.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might might say,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's a couple teachers up there that, that do dress up more than others.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there,|sd
B|you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, and you always,|%
A|course, it's a standing joke, you know, when the, when the men come in in a, a tie and a suit coat, you say, you know, what, have you got a job interview today|sd
A|or, there, there's, There's usually, yeah, there's usually something going on that, that, uh, and would, would, uh, cause that to happen|sd
B|Or you're going to be observed.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I, I don't know how a coach would feel if, that teaches health or you know, English, or whatever that they had to wear a tie.|sd
A|I,|%
A|some of those male coaches, that might really,|sv
B|Right.|b
B|They go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|and a T-shirt.|^2
A|Right.|b
A|That I didn't ever understand.|sd
A|I mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period|sd
A|so|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well at Vines, the coaches don't do that.|sd
A|Whether,|%
B|They, they dress pretty good, I would say|sd
B|and then they go to their coaching|sd
B|and they, they put their shorts on there.|sd
A|Change then.|^2
A|Well, see, that's what I would think.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's what I would think.|sd
B|But, they, they don't look, you know, they don't wear their sweat pants or, or anything.|sd
B|They're, they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation, not in P E.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Course, we had, had one coach, one period he'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E|sd
B|Those I can understand.|sd
A|and, and that's hard.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, so he just left warm-ups on,|sd
A|but, but, uh, no,|%
A|I think, really probably, they could, they could, uh, really,|sv
A|and I don't know if, if they put, make uniforms the thing for the kids,|sd
A|I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top|sd
A|and,|%
B|I don't think we'll ever get to that.|sd
A|You don't think so.|b
B|No,|nn
B|I don't think.|sd
B|I think we're going the opposite direction.|sd
B|It's the parochial schools that I guess many|sv
B|they've had uniforms for years,|sd
B|I don't really know if they still do.|sd
A|Well, some of them, yes they do|sd
A|and, and it's not at some of the private schools,|sd
B|It certainly makes it easier to dress.|sd
A|but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where, where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers, you know, dress in accordance with that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run, I think, that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well I, I think it would make a difference at school.|sv
A|I, I don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing too shorts, too short|sv
A|or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high, you know,|sv
A|I mean it's a lot of trouble to, to take care of that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, of course, the kids say, then why bother, just let me wear what I want.|sd
A|And, and yet we can't to that either.|sv
A|I'd like to see them go to, to not necessarily a uniform, but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt. You know,|sv
A|that would, that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them.|sv
A|But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted|sv
A|and,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|but I doubt that that would come that that will come about.|sd
A|And then the girls,|sv
B|Just|%
A|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I,|%
A|I don't,|%
A|no,|aa
A|not in Plano.|sv
B|No|aa
B|not,|%
A|They may get|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there.|sd
B|Well, I think it does.|sv
B|It, it takes their minds off of, of trying to compete.|sv
A|Highland Park's thinking about going that route.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it,|%
A|and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional|sv
B|but,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I agree with you on,|sv
