B|so you can,|%
A|Are they different from aerobics|qy
A|or is it the same thing?|qrr
B|No|nn
B|it's really, it's an aerobic routine.|sd
B|you warm up|sd
B|and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, you know, slowly and then working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate|sd
B|and then you gradually go down again.|sd
A|And you do that every day|qy^d
A|or,|%

A|Do you go with friends|qy
A|or do you go alone?|qrr
B|No,|nn
B|I go by myself|sd
