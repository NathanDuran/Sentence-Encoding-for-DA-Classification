A|It, it always has been though. You know,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they have been.|sv
A|it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness.|sv

A|Right.|aa
A|Now they've got a unique uh, feature in them now.|sd
A|If, uh, if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside.|sd
A|It'll go underneath the car instead.|sd
B|Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
A|So that's, that's a big safety factor they've got in them now.|sd

B|That's what we have now,|sd
B|but of course if I have a choice I'd still have the Cadillac|sd

B|Right.|b
A|you just don't want any hassles with it.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|You just, you expect it to do its, its job,|sv

B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|They just expect you to buy their product,|sv
A|but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Price is, is an issue,|sv
A|but it's not the most important issue.|sv
B|No,|aa
