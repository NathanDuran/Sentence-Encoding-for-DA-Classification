A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|do you subscribe to magazines yourself?|qy
B|I don't, uh, subscribe to any magazines at home, because we get so many at work that, uh, I need to read that, uh, I just don't take any at home.|sd
A|Oh, I see.|bk
A|I get, uh, MCCALL'S.|sd
A|Of course, anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to go back to work What I enjoy about staying home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I read magazines mainly because they're fast|sd
A|and if I want to relax while I watch T V,|sd
A|of course, I'm one of those that does two things at once,|sd
A|and, uh, I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S.|sd
A|And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and, uh, several magazines like that a few years ago at, at, at home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then you stopped them all.|qy^d
B|But, yeah,|ny
B|the subscriptions ran out|sd
B|and I never renewed them.|sd
B|And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work, to read them.|sd
A|I find that, uh, about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then I kind of get turned off by it. Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when, uh, when I'm really have time and I really want to read something, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with uh, on a general basis,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we travel a lot|sd
A|so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know, different ones.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And I get into, uh, newspapers,|sd
A|so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am.|sd
A|I'm, read it fast and put it down|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|When, when I had my magazines at home, I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures, you know,|sd
B|and if something caught my eye, then I might read something,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but otherwise than that, you know, they were, uh, you know, not too useful to me. You know|sd
A|Well, That's what I do.|sd
B|I got some good recipes from them sometimes,|sd
B|but|%
A|You clip recipes|sv
A|and you save them forever|sv
A|and you never really use them.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right,|ba
B|that's right.|ba
A|And then every so often you weed through them|sv
A|and you think, where did I ever put that recipe.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, that's mainly my, uh, whole idea on you know, short subject, uh, reading and things like this.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I subscribe, like I said, to a few|sd
A|and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what, uh, pertains to my daily life at the present time.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, since I work with computers during my work, I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything.|sd
B|And I have to read the magazines, you know, such as BYTE, and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these, uh, magazines such as that,|sd
B|so I really, you know, just,|%
B|I can see that it will be a very long time, probably, before I subscribe to any magazines at home.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, sometimes, if, you know, if you're in transportation, in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|But I think,|sv
A|and the idea is to, is and good,|sv
A|I can just dump them at the other end|sd
A|and I don't have to carry them back with me.|sd
B|That's right.|ba
A|I do that when we travel.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|no matter what it is, air travel or anything and I,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was, you know, kind of a little bit more than what I needed,|sd
A|so I never did get into them.|sd
A|I when I bought the computer, all of a sudden I was receiving them, for some unknown reason, through the mail.|sd
A|I think they all thought, well, we have a live one She'll subscribe|sd
