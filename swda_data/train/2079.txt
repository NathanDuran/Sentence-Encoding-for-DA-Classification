A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'll let you start first, okay?|qy
B|Okay.|na
B|We, um, I'm presently living in a house, uh,|sd
B|first time, uh,|sd
B|we had the house built|sd
B|and so this is our, our fifth year in it I guess,|sd
B|and, uh, um, it was a real excitement to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one made and built|sd
B|and like you wanted it, we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses.|sd
B|And, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home,|sd
B|and they're good for about five years or four years|sd
B|and after that they start falling apart.|sd
B|So, I would, uh, not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in, uh, because they're overpriced, uh,|sd
B|but they're a cheap house.|sd
B|If you can't afford something good, you know,|sd
B|they're good for that,|sv
B|and, um, you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head,|sd
B|but as far as the costs for what your getting, uh, the longevity of the house is not, uh, is not worth it.|sv
B|How about in your case?|qo
A|Well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter,|sd
A|but, in fact, he's in electronics,|sd
A|but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it.|sd
A|So it took him about two and a half years,|sd
A|but, uh, he built us a house,|sd
A|it's, uh,|%
A|we have thirty-two hundred square feet,|sd
A|and it's a brick house,|sd
A|and price-wise, it was great because he did it all himself, you know,|sd
A|so that way he could, we could kind of control, in, control it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we live in kind of a small town,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I mean it's nothing fancy, you know,|sd
A|it's, it's a house,|sd
A|it's nice,|sv
A|and it's real pretty|sv
A|and we're all comfortable in it.|sd
B|Well, that's great,|ba
B|that's great,|ba
B|that's, uh,|%
B|I've heard,|sd
B|I have another gentleman, friend of mine, who, uh, who had a house built|sd
B|as a matter of fact another guy is building one now,|sd
B|he's been doing it for three years|sd
B|and the city's a little upset with him,|sd
B|but I understand you save a lot of money off, uh, by doing that,|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Oh, you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else.|sd
B|Nothing wrong with that,|sv
A|You know.|%
B|uh, I'll vouch for that.|sd
B|Um,|%
A|But, uh, of course, my husband did everything except|sd
A|my brother's a trim carpenter,|sd
A|and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us,|sd
A|and that helped.|sd
B|That was a big savings.|bf
A|And, uh,|%
A|yes,|aa
A|and, uh, we had to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else, nothing, you know,|sd
B|Well, that's great.|ba
B|uh, have you been in it long?|qy
B|Oh, really,|b
B|well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?|qy
A|no,|nn
A|we're,|%
A|well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now,|sd
A|and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,|sd
A|but he will not build a second one himself. Because he says age-wise he'll never be able to handle that again|sd
B|I see,|b
B|well,|%
B|First one is always a bear.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
B|We're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us|sd
B|and that can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any you know,|sd
B|so that's kind of, we just got with him and told him what all we wanted,|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it|sd
B|and he's certified, and registered|sd
B|so at least we know we're, it's not going to fall in or something if it's built.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh.|b
B|But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right,|sd
B|you can actually go out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things|sd
B|and, and that's kind of the plan I have|sd
B|so, I'm, uh,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|everyone I talk to, uh, I file in my little book and do other things with it .|sd
B|That's great,|^q
B|that's great.|^q
A|But, uh, like I said otherwise, you know, the expense,|sd
A|but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|I can imagine.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that,|sd
A|but, you know, it's ours.|sd
B|If your happy with it, that's all that counts.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|That's all,|sv
B|you only have to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.|sv
A|apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high|sv
B|Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell, I guess.|sv
A|Isn't it?|qy
A|It really is|sv
A|because I, I'm always shocked at about, you know, what they have it appraised at,|sd
A|I think, oh my goodness.|sd
B|Well that's great.|ba
B|Well, yeah,|%
B|I guess that about does it.|sv
A|Okay,|aa
A|and it was nice talking to you.|fc
B|Nice talking with you, too.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
