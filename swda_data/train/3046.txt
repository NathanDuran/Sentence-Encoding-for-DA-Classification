B|Yeah.|ny
A|Okay.|bk
A|Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I guess so,|^h
B|it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there|qy^d
A|Well, I don't know,|arp_nd
A|my brother lives down East of us down there,|sd
A|and I don't think they ate all that much different|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,|sv
A|course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|Uh.|b
B|Well, uh, the thing that I found interesting,|sd
B|my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and it's not as good as if it's fresh.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,|sd
B|but it just, didn't taste right.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of|sd
B|and, we drink ice tea with every meal,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well they do in the summertime,|sv
A|I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.|sv
B|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it never gets real cold.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, I,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|I know that, um, I do a lot of planning with our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish|sd
B|or. And Italian food is real big too.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.|bf
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|How about you,|qo
B|what is real popular up there?|qw
A|Well, I don't know,|no
A|just about anything|arp_nd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we, we really, uh, use most anything.|sd
A|I, uh, I think like parties and that though are,|%
A|well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|But, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Your, uh, bread family and your,|sd
A|or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and , ham and bake potatoes, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,|sd
A|you know they been advertising that|sd
A|and, we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|They have a lot of vegetable to them,|sv
A|and, uh, they really are very good.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|right.|b
B|Oh, yes.|aa
B|I, I love that kind of cooking.|sd
B|My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things|sd
A|Is he a meat and potato person?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|They.|sd
A|Well, all our family is, is gone.|sd
A|They are out on their own.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh. It, it's much different|sd
B|That probably makes it easier,|sv
B|but.|%
A|and, uh.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese|sd
B|and, uh, and of course ,|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well, my husband didn't like that,|sd
A|so we, us kids,|%
A|we had five children|sd
A|and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that's what we had|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, that's pretty much what we do,|sd
B|if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese, or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, they like, uh, spaghetti.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, that's one meal, I can fix|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|and the whole family eats.|sd
B|But, uh, there are several things that,|%
B|well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.|sd
A|Oh, those always go good.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the children love them,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, they are real easy to cook|sv
B|and, that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and my girls don't like beef,|sd
B|I, don't know,|h
A|Oh really.|b
A|Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going.|sv
B|I guess,|h
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|it could be, they don't,|%
B|I think it's the texture of it,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it takes more chewing|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it is easier to chew.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|So they're not too much into beef.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My husband and I eat more beef than we should,|sd
B|but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them|sd
A|Right.|b
A|We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know if you do or not,|qy^d
A|but we, we don't a whole lot,|sd
A|we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have a real tiny little house,|sd
B|we don't have room really, to have people here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|But, we do get together for fellowships at our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,|%
A|Well that's good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it is|aa
B|and it's fun to, uh,|sd
B|I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we do a lot of that take , things to church|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and our homemakers meet at the church also,|sd
A|and, uh, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you don't really include any certain food groups,|sd
A|you just bring, what you like|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That's right|aa
A|Sometimes you have all desserts,|sd
A|sometimes, you have all vegetables|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's true,|aa
B|that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, uh, like best.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|But, it doesn't happen very often,|sd
A|usually you get a pretty wide variety|sd
A|and you can, you can , have pretty good meals, from one of those.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.|sd
A|Oh, those are fun.|ba
B|It's the only time that ever.|%
B|Yeah|aa
B|they are.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's the only time I can remember that,|sd
B|I can't remember what food it was|sd
B|I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.|sd
B|Several people were supposed to bring, you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer, and a main dish and a dessert.|sd
A|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers|sd
B|and, but when we came to the main, main dish plate, there was only like two or three|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh|b
A|, Oh.|b
A|Was there enough to go around?|qy
B|Well, not really,|ng
B|you know we all took real tiny little portions, and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we were not sure who didn't show up with the food|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|and you know they know better.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Either, either go ahead and fix your dish|sv
B|or call someone that can.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|I know it.|b
B|Well, that sounds neat,|ba
B|I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,|sd
B|but you sound so close.|sd
A|They said that we could share, we share, a recipe|sd
B|It sounds like you're here in Dallas.|sd
A|but, I'm up at my daughter's,|sd
A|I don't even have any of my recipes with me.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, you know ,|%
B|I don't know if I have anything handy,|sd
