A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|while I was waiting for you to connect, I, I thought of a couple of menus,|sd
A|so I decided it had to be in it, informal or not.|sd
A|You know because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year where it's so nice out. *sv|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|aa
A|Um, if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something.|sd
A|I'm not I'm not into formal dinner parties,|sd
A|but I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic bread.|sd
B|I see.|b
B|So what do you use for cookbooks?|qw
A|Um, I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married,|sd
A|but, it's kind of the bible of cooking for me.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful You know, budget cookbooks,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but and, of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I cook a lot the same as, as my mom did,|sd
A|of course I've added several different recipes,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but, what you serve or what would you|qw
B|Well, I, I, I think we come from, from different backgrounds, uh,|sd
B|so the,|%
A|Well, that's good|ba
B|I, I, I,|%
B|so, it you know,|%
B|have different perspectives that you are.|sv
B|I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to, to fall back on,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because it has almost everything in it.|sd
B|But on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, uh,|sv
B|it's a good reference when you need to dig something up.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK,|sd
B|I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|uh, which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes, you know, the whole meal|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and so she's|%
A|that would be wonderful in these times|ba
B|yeah,|b
B|now, now, I, I find that the cutting up of the food, and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes.|sd
A|Yeah, Uh-huh.|aa
B|But they're, but they're, but they're interesting they're interesting menus, um, combinations that you wouldn't have, nobody thought of.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|%
A|What's one of your favorites?|qw
B|Um, gee,|^h
B|the one I had most recently was, was one that, was,|sd
B|she, she describes as Jim Beard's favorite, um, summer menu, or something,|sd
B|and it consisted of, of grilled kielbasa sausage uh, a potato salad with olive oil, and uh, some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Wow,|ba
A|sounds too good.|ba
B|Uh, and that, and that was, you know, that's, that, that's certain you can do in thirty minutes.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But there are a whole lot of, you know,|sd
B|I mean, I, I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person.|ad
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.|aa
B|THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK.|sd
A|That sounds fun.|ba
A|I find a lot of the cookbooks that, I don't know, that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I have young children,|sd
A|and our budget's set, you know, at this time,|sd
A|but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|yes.|aa
A|That's why sometimes I shy away from, uh, more of a traditional cookbook|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, well, it was interesting talking to you.|sv
A|It's a fun subject.|sv
A|Food is one of my favorite things too.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Anything else you wanted to add?|qo
B|Well, you had said dinner, you know, you know,|sd
B|what would I put together for a formal dinner.|^q
B|We, we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|and, and, um, put, here, here|%
B|the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert, you know, a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella um, which is this wonderful thing you can do, um,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that's good.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|basically you're baking, baking chicken in a, in an open pan, um, having marinated it first|sd
B|and, my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, um, and cooked with some olives and some, and some prunes, uh,|sd
B|there's a little bit of brown sugar in there,|sd
B|and it bakes up|sd
B|and it's a delicious thing,|sd
B|and it's easy|sd
A|That sounds good.|ba
B|comparatively. Um. I'm sorry,|sd
A|That sounds really good.|ba
B|I just love|sd
A|It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am,|sv
A|I'm pretty simple right now,|sd
A|but.|%
B|Well, maybe a little more leisure time to do it.|sv
A|Yes|aa
B|I don't know,|h
A|that's probably, that's true,|aa
A|I have little ones|sd
A|and we, and they won't eat, you know, too many different foods right now.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes.|sd
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yeah.|b

B|they'd, you know,|%
B|canned ravioli was, one of their favorites, and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli.|sd
