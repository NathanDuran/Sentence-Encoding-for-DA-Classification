A|Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.|sd
B|Well, they've, uh, statewide raises,|sd
B|they raise ours it seems like constantly.|sd
B|We just, uh, passed a new one, uh,|sd
B|fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines.|sd
A|Oh, right|b
A|Indianapolis got that, didn't they?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|And, uh, we had passed a, a provisional one that if, if it did, if they did locate here we would raise our taxes.|sd
B|But, uh, at least we thought we'd get something back from that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, how do you feel about taxes?|qo
A|Well, it seems like a big politics game|sv
A|like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election|sd
A|so he said the budget was fine,|sd
A|the state didn't have any money|sd
A|and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money|sd
A|so they raised all our taxes.|sd
A|And now it's election time again|sd
A|so they're trying to lower them.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So they're just talk about lowering them|sd
A|but they never do,|sd
A|they just keep raising them.|sd
B|I've never seen taxes really go down.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|me neither.|sd
A|Well, actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long|sd
A|so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year|sd
A|and they're going to lower it for next year.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.|sv
B|I hope they put that in writing|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|they say they're going to lower,|sd
A|but I'll see.|sd
B|I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share|sv
B|and of course the poor can't afford it either,|sv
B|but, uh, I really feel like|%
B|and, and I feel like, you know,|%
B|I'm a middle class person income wise anyway|sd
B|and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|so do I.|sd
A|I mean, I'm a, a middle class barely,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying less, not enough,|sv
A|I think they're paying too much.|sv
B|You think the rich are paying too much?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month, well, that's ridiculous.|sv
A|Why bother working?|qh
B|Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to,|sd
B|I mean, I'm talking about the really rich.|sd
A|Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That would be fair.|sv
B|Now I'll go along with that. You know,|aa
A|Yeah|b
A|no loopholes or anything.|sv
A|Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Now, I think that would be fair.|aa
A|Right.|b
B|And I, you know,|%
B|no, no ifs, ands and buts, you know,|sv
B|no big elaborate laws that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.|sv
B|It's just, you know, you make this, you pay ten percent.|sv
B|If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,|sv
B|if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's the way our state tax is here.|sd
A|I think it's pretty fair.|sv
B|Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.|sd
A|Oh|b
B|So, and, and you withhold no matter what you do,|sd
B|they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough.|sd
A|Oh, great,|ba
A|so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|so now, you know, when you sign your W-Four form or whatever, W-Two whatever that is, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state. Which is ridiculous,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I guess you have to check yes|sv
A|or you come down to the end of the year|sv
A|and you don't have it to give it to them.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|unless you have a lot of deductions.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|And you end up owing, you know,|sv
B|you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal|sv
B|and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state.|sv
A|Ouch|ba
B|And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.|sv
B|But, I, I don't know.|h
B|I've,|%
B|they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in, in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I'll say|ba
B|I mean twenty-five percent increase.|sd
A|is,|%
