B|Real problem the last few days, one of their, uh, young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|it was a catcher.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they really don't have an excess of catchers|sv
B|and it's really kind of, kind of late to, you know, to start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|They're not the highest paying ball team around.|sd
A|Oh no,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|they're not, are they.|qy
B|But I, you know, I would, I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you.|sd
A|Oh, goodness,|ba
A|I would too,|sd
A|even the bench warmer, I would.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
B|I really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years.|sd
B|I used to go, take my son, you know,|sd
B|when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'll have to admit I kind, I kind of went more to see, to see the other team a lot of times than I did the, did the Rangers,|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|But, I think they're doing better.|sv
A|Well, I do to, uh,|aa
A|I have boys, you know, like eight and eleven|sd
A|and we go quite often, to watch the Rangers.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I can imagine.|ba
B|I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh yes,|aa
A|we're heavy into that too.|sd
B|I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.|sv
A|Oh, I do too.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I think, uh, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, you know,|sv
A|yes.|%
B|Oh of course,|aa
B|of course.|aa
B|As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning,|sd
B|he just pitched his first, uh, exhibition game a day or so ago,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he pitched five, uh, yeah, five full innings.|sd
B|That was almost unheard of for a pitcher to, you know, to start out that strong.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yes,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|no big deal, you know,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|it's just part of a day's work.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I know it,|sv
A|yeah,|%
A|yeah.|%
B|He's something else,|sv
B|he really is.|sv
A|He really is an, you know,|sv
A|as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.|sv
B|They could do very well,|sv
B|they sure could.|sv
A|They because|%
A|I don't know|h
A|but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|right.|b
A|I really do.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they've got, uh, I guess all,|%
B|well all their players are signed now.|sd
B|Some of them are not too happy about it|sv
B|but there, there's no hold outs.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah|b
A|at least, that should help,|sv
B|So that should help.|sv
A|it sure should.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it should, uh-huh.|sv
A|But in a way, I really do,|%
A|and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.|sd
B|Oh yeah,|aa
B|sure.|aa
A|Like Oakland A's and the Giants|sv
A|I really do.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Sure,|b
B|sure,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|Cincinnati.|sv
B|Yeah,|%
B|there sure are.|sd
A|I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b

A|But, uh,|%
B|I've never seen the Astros play.|sd

A|Uh, they're a good ball team.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|They really are.|sv
B|They sure are.|aa
B|Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between the Rangers and the Astros.|qy
A|Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it though|qh
B|Boy,|ba
B|I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.|sv
A|Wouldn't it.|qh

A|we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.|qy
B|That's right,|na
B|wouldn't that be something.|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|It sure would.|sv
A|That's something you dream about.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|But there are a lot of Ranger fans around.|sv
A|Oh, there sure is|aa
A|and, uh, that, I mean they really are.|sv
A|Uh, now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him|qy^d
A|but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and, be on top.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b

B|he's a bull, isn't he?|qy

A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though.|sd
B|Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year|sv

B|Yeah,|b
B|that, you know, may or may not happen.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh you never know.|sv

A|That's sure|%
A|if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right,|aa
B|unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|no, like that Joe Hosago you know.|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
