A|Uh, I don't know about you,|h
A|but, uh, I work outside the home|sd
A|and, uh, in fact, uh, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work|sd
A|and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have I don't have the family time.|sd
A|Uh, when my husband gets home, it's usually, he's home with my daughter alone|sd
A|and then a couple of hours later I'm home.|sd
A|Uh, I don't know,|h
A|I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less and less family time available to them.|sd
A|And, uh, it seems that business wise, uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family.|sv
A|So, you know, if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done, uh, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children,|sv
A|and it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.|sv
B|I agree|aa
A|And, you know, I look at my daughter|sd
A|and she's now, uh, four, going to be four|sd
A|and I keep saying oh jeez, I don't have that much time with her|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And she's growing fast|sd
A|and,|%
B|I know that I have three children.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I stay home.|sd
B|I don't work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I know that it, it must be really challenging to, uh, try to juggle a job and, and also your children.|sv
B|Because I know my husband, if I were gone as much as he is we wouldn't have the influence on them that I would want to put on them.|sd
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yeah|aa
A|Sure.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
B|And  I also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They don't want to play around adults.|sd
B|They don't want to be around you.|sd
B|They don't want you to tell them what to do.|sd
B|They want to do their own thing.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|And they're the very same age as my children.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
B|And I'm  finding as I volunteer up at the school, I just, being, uh,|sd
B|I'm not educated at all in, uh, really detecting this|sd
B|but I can talk to the teacher and tell them, on a pretty good basis, after I've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure,|b
A|sure.|b
B|And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that, uh, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Not that the kids that go out aren't  getting that|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|it's just a different,|sv
B|they're, they are more use to being with their own age kids|sv
A|Sure.|b
B|they're not use to being with adults and to  responding  to adults.|sv
A|Sure.|b
A|Sure.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I ,|%
B|Uh, I think the trend in the United  States,|sv
B|I feel really bad that it's turned so much  to where the children  are,  uh,|sv
A|I think so too.|aa
A|In  fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter,|sd
A|so I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.|sd
A|And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare|sd
A|and I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,|sv
A|whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.|sv
A|But how these women must feel to place their children into care|sv
A|and, you know, it's our society saying yes,|sv
A|this, uh, you need this job.|^q
A|It's a little bit financial type thing|sv
A|because, uh, if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are|sv
A|and  that's part of it too.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.|sv
A|Got a part-time job|sv
A|and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have the boat,|sv
A|I'll have the car|^q
A|and  it's nice|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh,|sv
A|because it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now|sv
A|and,|%
B|It's  hard.|sv
B|It really is hard.|sv
B|I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of  sacrificing  to keep me home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure,|aa
A|I  did it  for three years|sd
B|And, uh,|%
A|and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it|sd
A|and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home|sv
A|and you're not getting any further, you know, along|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time|sv
A|and you have to make that decision|sv
A|and it's a tough one.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|I think  one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, how they spend their time with their children|sv
A|And I,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think with working moms, if you can get them the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work,|sv
A|Sure.|b
