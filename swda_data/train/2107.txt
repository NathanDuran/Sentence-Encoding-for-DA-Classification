A|I lost one, one time, uh,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|the first one I got.|sd
A|He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it started raining|sd
A|and I was hysterical.|sd
A|I was, I was,|%
A|I mean, you would have thought a child had died.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I called everyone I knew,|sd
A|I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|I understand.|ba
A|And they laughed at me,|sd
A|they thought that was so hysterical.|sd
B|Oh no,|ba
B|I understand,|ba
B|we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours,|sd
B|we've had, you know, they've been ill,|sd
B|I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.|sd
B|And then we had a baby|sd
B|and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.|sd
A|The cat was here first|bf
A|so I know,|sd
A|it's hard.|sv
B|And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.|sd
A|Oh, how funny.|ba
B|It's like all right, whose corners is this one.|sd
A|That's sweet,|ba
A|I have the two,|sd
A|the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|And they didn't used to be actually,|sd
A|but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,|sd
A|so I put them outside once I got a house|sd
A|and they're doing great out there,|sd
A|they love it.|sd
A|But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Other than that he gets scared to death.|sd
A|If you shut that door he goes into hiding.|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh-huh,|aa
B|that's it|sv
A|And Lord knows what happened to him.|sd
A|He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|traumatized for life here.|bf
A|Probably.|aap_am
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|we've,|%
B|all four of ours are house cats.|sd
A|Are they.|bh
B|We started out with two, with two outdoor cats|sd
B|but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.|sd
A|Oh no.|ba
B|Oh well he lived through it,|sd
B|oh, I couldn't believe it.|sd
B|We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.|sd
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|The, the cat almost died,|sd
B|and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat,|sd
B|oh he loves life now.|sd
A|Oh, I imagine.|ba
B|And he's like oh, thank you so much.|sd
A|I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.|sd
B|I know,|aa
B|we wondered about that.|sd
B|But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.|sd
A|Oh, I can imagine,|ba
A|what did he shoot him with.|qw
B|Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun|sd
B|and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.|sd
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
A|People are crazy.|sv
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|absolutely nuts.|sv
B|But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet|sd
B|and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery|sd
B|and,|%
A|Oh Lord.|ba
B|I mean he started off as a stray|sd
B|and then we did all this for him|sd
A|Oh man.|ba
B|But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.|sd
A|I imagine.|ba
A|They usually are after something like that happens to them.|sv
A|It seems to mellow them or something.|sv
B|Oh yes.|aa
B|But, uh, we wouldn't we wouldn't have them,|sd
B|I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.|sd
A|No.|aa
B|There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.|sd
A|Oh yeah,|aa
A|I I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things.|sd
A|But I can't give them up.|sd
B|Oh no.|aa
A|I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.|sd
B|Right|aa
B|and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.|bf
A|Oh, oh yeah,|aa
A|and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.|sd
B|We, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.|sd

A|we have to keep it.|bf
A|Yeah,|b
A|my, my first one that I got,|sd
A|I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment.|sd
A|It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
A|So I found this one|sd
A|and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.|sd
B|Oh uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought well that's interesting,|sd
A|I'll call them.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|And he was the only one left|sd
A|and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|And he was the last one she carried across, you know,|sd
A|the whole big sad story.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So of course, I had to take him.|sd
A|I felt so sorry for him after that.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|he,|%
A|I asked the vet why he did that|sd
A|and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|But he is the lovingest cat.|sd
A|Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.|sd
B|Oh.|b

A|he, he doesn't have any front claws,|sd
A|I had him declawed,|sd

A|he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.|sd
B|Oh that's good.|ba
B|Oh we just, uh, just love them.|sd
B|They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey|sd
B|and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest|sd
