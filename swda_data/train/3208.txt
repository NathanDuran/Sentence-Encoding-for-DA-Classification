A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, basically I am a mother of a three year old,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's, uh, extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child, uh, trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I've been pretty selective,|sd
A|and what I'm finding is with, um, day cares that are like day care centers like, for instance, uh, Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that. Uh, like nap time or whatever time, uh, because of parents' hours they are|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and when I bring my daughter into such a system like that, uh, they only have one thing going on|sd
A|and that's nap time.|sd
A|Everybody is napping, whether they came there an hour before or they came right during that time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down, on a cot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, um, home day care has been an option.|sd
A|And I've looked into that.|sd
A|The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe, uh, can you trust the people, you know.|sd
B|That's right.|ba
A|Um,|%
B|And you never know.|sv
B|I have, um, an ex-sister-in-law that, um, currently has a child abuse case on a home baby-sitter.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Sure.|b
A|Oh, sure.|ba
A|Sure.|b
A|That's really scary.|ba
A|And, To the point that you kind of say to yourself, especially home day care|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours, it's fine.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|It depends on the age of the child.|sd
A|Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while|sv
A|but home home day care works well if it's an infant.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|If it's, if it's,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The kids have, colds|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and they're sick all the time|sd
A|and|%
