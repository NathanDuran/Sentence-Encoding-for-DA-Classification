B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|make sure it's nice and brown on both sides|ad
B|and then you take it out of the fat|ad
B|and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan|ad
B|and you kind of clean it out|ad
B|and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.|ad
B|Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.|ad
B|And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.|ad
B|Stir it real, real well.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.|ad
B|And you let it come to a boil again|ad
B|and then you let it simmer|ad
B|and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.|ad
A|Oh.|b
B|And that's going to, it's going to be really good|sv
A|That's very spicy, too.|bf
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's,|%
A|I mean these bell peppers and curry.|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Oh, that sounds really good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Huh.|b
A|I guess it was,|sd
A|is this dinner time for you?|qy
B|Uh, well it will be in a little while,|na
B|I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.|sd
A|All done in advance,|bf
A|yeah.|b
A|That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook|sd
A|but I was single until I was thirty|sd
A|so I did cook a little, you know.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, and I cook a little bit now.|sd
A|What I like to do mostly is stir fries|sd
A|and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight|sd
A|and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.|sd
B|What kind of wok do you have,|qw
B|is it, is it a real Chinese wok.|qy
A|It's, it's called a stir fry pan|sd
A|and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric|sd
A|so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I see.|b
A|And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.|sd
A|But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.|sd
A|And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.|sd
A|That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor|sd
A|and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've used,|%
A|you turn them over.|sd
A|A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,|sd
A|we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,|sd
A|so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.|sd
B|Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,|sv
A|It's, it's a pretty big|sd
A|and we put that over rice.|sd
B|I just don't like squash.|sd
A|Oh, you don't|bf
B|I never did.|sd
B|My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash|sd
B|and she'd have squash and corn bread|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'd just be,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.|sd
A|My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.|sd
A|I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh|sd
A|and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Red meat and a potato.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba
B|We, we were from North Carolina|sd
B|and we had a garden|sd
B|and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash|sd
B|and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,|sd
A|Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|See, never, no vegetables in my family.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|it was really funny.|sd
B|You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens|sd
A|Well that was a real farm.|bf
B|You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,|sd
A|I've heard stories.|sd
B|And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub|sd
B|and finally it dies down,|sd
B|you get just a little patter|sd
B|and then it,|sd
A|Oh, this is|sv
A|you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.|ad
B|Getting ready to eat chicken too.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|you should be careful|ad
A|That's pretty funny.|sv
A|But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens|sd
A|but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,|sd
A|we, we bought everything in a grocery store.|sd

A|and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts|sd
A|and uh, we came back with sweets.|sd
B|Ugh.|ba
A|We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian|sd
A|and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office|sd
