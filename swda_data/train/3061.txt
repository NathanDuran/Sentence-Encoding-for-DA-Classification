A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|we, have five.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before|qy^d
B|or,|%
A|Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.|sd
A|She was fifteen when she died.|sd

A|And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|people drop things like that off, up there,|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."|sd
A|I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Go get her.|^q
A|So that's how we got her, quite by accident.|sd
B|Isn't that,|b
B|Yes.|b
B|So that often happens that way.|sv
B|Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.|sd
B|We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went, then we went out then, and found one,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|she was in the litter,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.|sd
B|I mean, they were all over the place,|sd
B|and she was real docile and, came over and just kind of sat next to us,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I thought, that's the dog for me|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|She picked us|^q
B|Yeah,|b
B|so she,|%
B|and it,|%
B|what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,|sd
B|let's see,|^h
B|she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, she just loved this little dog, to pieces|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.|sd
B|I think, she was always a little bit leery of her.|sv
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,|sd
B|but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.|sd
A|Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
B|So you just never know how that works out|sv
A|No.|aa
A|But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
A|they want to and tell them anything they want to|sv
A|and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's right.|ba
A|or|%
B|That,|%
B|yes,|b
B|they're very, unjudgmental|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes|b
B|Oh, dear|ba
A|And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.|sv
B|Yes,|b
B|I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|and how,|%
A|Our one, our one nursing home in has one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Permanent|sd
B|Is that right?|qy
A|He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is or somebody takes care of him.|na
B|Isn't that amazing?|bh
A|But he goes out people,|sv
A|and real nice dog, uh,|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
B|It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis|sd
B|and, um, there were several dogs on the campus|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and, the,|%
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,|sd
B|but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.|sd
B|And, um, I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|They were healthy, looking dogs.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, our guide that day said that the , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah|b
A|because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,|sv
B|I know.|b
A|they just do not allow them.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I know.|sv
A|That's, that's kind of great.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|it really was.|sv
B|It was just a nice touch,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it kind of made it seem more homey too|sv
A|Yes,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But, um,|%
B|I thought that was most unique.|sv
B|And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, um, but, uh, I,|%
B|this is the only pet we've had you know,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|in all our years of marriage, um,|sd
B|and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs|sd
B|but they were always hunting dogs,|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|they were always kind of,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we've ruined them|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|right.|b
B|That's what he said.|sd
A|They say ruined them|sv
B|Yes.|b
B|So having a pet was a little bit different for him.|sd
A|Well, we've had a lot of different pets.|sd
A|We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we also raised them for food, at one time.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Oh, yes.|b
A|And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about|sd
B|Oh, my golly.|ba
A|She was in the house|sd
B|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|Isn't that interesting?|bh
B|I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.|sd
A|Well, don't ever get one for a pet.|ad
B|Oh.|b
A|They're okay,|sd
A|but like she, uh,|%
A|they don't ever learn their name.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you had to go chase her down.|sd
B|I'll be darned.|ba
B|How interesting.|ba
A|And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.|sd
A|But,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.|sd
A|They,|%
A|before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, they're not|sd
A|I mean, they use the litter box.|sd
A|That's about it .|sd
B|Isn't that interesting?|bh
B|That's, that's really something.|ba
B|Um, how long did you have that?|qw
A|Oh, my, how, how long?|bf
A|Probably seven or eight years.|sd
B|Goodness sake.|ba
A|And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"|sd
A|so, we moved her to the basement,|sd
A|and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, built her a pen outside|sd
B|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Isn't that funny?|bh
A|And I thought, I put up with that all those years|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|and this is what it took finally|bf
A|And, we've had, we've had cats, stay in the house. Different times.|sd
B|That is,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, one of them ran off.|sd
A|She ran off once,|sd
A|or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,|sd
A|and the second time he never came back.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|he kind of moved into a woods down there.|sd
B|I'll be.|ba
A|And he got huge down there.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|He really grew|sd
A|but he, he never came back.|sd
B|That's That's interesting.|ba
B|I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.|sv
A|Well, he wasn't a whole lot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He was in the house most the time,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, he did go out sometimes|sd
A|and, uh, they|%
A|it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.|sd
B|Is that right?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|The, the cats,|%
A|my son has a cat,|sd
A|and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|it was, it was not a good,|sd
B|Well.|%
A|I don't know,|sd
A|it got,|%
A|it was just, did get strange|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so that that was right.|sv
A|And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it has improved the personality.|sd
