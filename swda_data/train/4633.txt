B|How many children do you have now?|qw
A|Well I have five.|sd
B|You have five?|br
A|Right.|aa
B|Well you do have a hard time finding time  then don't you?|qy
A|Well,  five are, I mean four of them are grown,|sd
A|they're in college or just out of college|sd
A|so I really have just a thirteen year old at home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|You sound so young.|sv
A|Well, I work at it|sd
B|All right|bk
B|To have them, uh,|%
A|I try to fool everybody|sd
B|I think you're doing a good job.|sv
B|I just  have one child.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I don't think, uh,|%
B|well there's not much I can do about it.|sd
B|My, my wife and I are, in our forties, you know,|sd
B|so, uh|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe.|sv
A|I think you are right|aa
A|because I was an only child too.|sd
A|And that's one reason I have so many because I really, I enjoy the big family.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters|sd
A|and so she is sort of like an only child|sd
A|and it's the same type of thing,  uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I have a younger brother like that.|sd
B|I'm in my forties, like I say|sd
B|and I have a brother in his twenties.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I was, I was the youngest.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I understand how that worked.|sd
B|And he was treated like he had five fathers  or something.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|That's exactly how it is, you know.|sd
A|She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her.|sd
A|When things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, yeah,|%
A|it, it's a little bit difficult, though.|sd
A|I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more.|sd
A|And,|%
B|Did  you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, Little League, uh,  soccer?|qy
A|We,  we really did not.|ng
A|My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion.|sd
A|She twirls a baton|sd
A|and we did a lot of things together.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|She and I did a lot of things together and flew,|sd
A|we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that was a lot of fun.|sd
A|But that, that, I guess you could consider that organized.|sv
A|I mean, there is a competition all the time.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We were very heavy into that.|sd
A|Other than that, they were pretty much,|sd
A|and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.|sd
B|You know, I think that's probably true. The,|sv
B|if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or activities|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and if you have a large number of children or, then you don't.|sv
A|Well, you can't afford to.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|you|%
B|and there's not enough time,  uh|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|like my son is in, uh, Little League this year.|sd
B|He's ten.|sd
B|And they practice three times a week|sd
B|and they have a game|sd
B|and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, I don't know, there would be no way to do it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|You know,  one parent go one direction|sv
B|and I'd have to go in the other|sv
B|and we could only cover two at that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter|sd
A|and my little one also competed because really she had no choice.|sd
A|She had to go with me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing|sd
A|and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,|sv
A|it was making the friends and going all the places|sv
A|and it was a really neat experience,|sd
A|but it took our total time.|sd
A|I did not work, uh, when I did this.|sd
A|Now I do work full-time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's just, my thirteen year old and myself|sd
A|and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other.|sd
A|So ,|%
B|I don't  think, although|sv
B|I think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me|sv
B|but I'm not sure I could afford three.|sv
B|I most certainly couldn't educate three.|sv
B|I don't know how my, my parents did it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, there were five of us|sd
B|and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular.|sd
B|Uh, but I don't know how my father did it.|sd
B|He worked at a truck line|sd
B|and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.|sd
B|But we did okay.|sd
B|We had a house and a home and,|sd
B|but now, my wife and I both work|sd
B|and we don't, I don't believe we have as much as my parents did|sd
B|and we only have one child.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, things cost a lot more.|sv
A|I don't know how it is in Georgia|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.|sv
B|Atlanta is horrible.|sd
A|Is it?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and, and different areas|sd
B|and from talking to them, they're shocked.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|and they, you know,|%
B|the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston  that they jump  on it.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's what I've heard.|aa
B|They sell their house,|sd
B|they stash away a good bit of money and come down here|sd
B|and I work with a lot of them,|sd
B|they, they think they, they have really done something.|sd
B|Then when they get down here, they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to, to where they came  from.|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|The housing is cheaper,|sd
B|but that's about it.|sd
A|I'm surprised to hear that.|arp_nd
A|I've heard very positive things about Atlanta,|sv
