A|Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
B|Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.|sd
A|Oh, you did?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I was on the jury. Uh,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Yeah|b
B|Which is funny because I got called last night|sd
B|and the topic was, uh, something about juries|sd
A|Oh, really|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|so I am just hitting it right.|sd
B|Uh, how do I feel about it?|qo
B|I, I don't know.|h
B|Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|well, the one I was just on, I don't,|sd
B|I was an alternate on the case,|sd
B|so I don't know what was decided.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|They are probably still in deliberations on it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, what I found out,|sd
B|once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy|sd
B|and I remember hearing about it.|sd
B|It was about a year ago.|sd
B|Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month|sd
B|and he was caught just,|sd
B|they, they drove up,|sd
B|the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|So he was caught|sd
B|and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in,|sd
B|I'm not in Dallas county,|sd
B|I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had two capital murders.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And last year there were six|sd
B|and this guy is indicted on three of them.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|so you have to wonder you know.|sv
A|Wow|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, the cases like that, they should,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.|sv
B|You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|He just, well,|%
B|from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,|sd
B|but I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Wow.|ba
B|So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.|qy
B|No,|nn
B|huh-uh.|nn
A|Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again I mean, you've got to do something.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Wow.|ba
B|And I,|%
B|the,|%
B|I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.|sd
A|You're kidding.|ba
B|But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone|sd
B|and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt|sd
B|and I said I can't imagine,|sd
B|I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,|sd
B|I guess I could convict him,|sd
B|but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But they really did.|sd
B|It was, it was really amazing.|sd
A|Really?|bh
A|Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,|sd
B|Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|so no one else would have known.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|It was, it was really pretty interesting.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|What,|%
B|Educational.|sd
A|I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.|sd
B|Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Of that crime|^2
B|Right.|b
A|but he was found guilty of|sd
A|okay.|b
B|Right,|b
B|so you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much to prove that.|sd
A|That works.|^2
A|Right.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, they pushing the death penalty?|qy
B|Uh, yeah,|ny
B|this guy is up for the death penalty.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.|sd
B|Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation|sd
B|And there is a number of questions|sd
B|and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment|sd
B|and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|So,|%
B|So there is a lot of outs,|sd
B|but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Right,|b
B|and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.|sv
A|That's true.|ba
A|I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|but,|%
B|But then you have to look at reality.|sd
B|I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out|sv
B|so,|%
A|That's true.|ba
B|But what is it worth?|bh
B|I don't know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.|sv
A|That's true.|ba
A|I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not|sv
A|or,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, you said you're from Mississippi?|bf
A|Yes, ma'am.|ny
B|And do they have the death penalty there?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|they do.|sd
A|I,|%
A|they've had a, a number of cases here.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, not a whole lot,|sd
A|well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was like last like year they had forty-nine|sd
A|so that's going up.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|they have a death penalty.|sd
A|I hear of one every now and then.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I visited the prison up here and, at Parchman|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I've been,|%
A|I haven't,|%
A|they won't let you on death row,|sd
A|but they'll let you look down the hall.|sd
A|You can't see any prisoners|sd
A|and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.|sd
A|I've been|%
A|they took us around on a tour, you know,|sd
A|and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber|sd
B|Ooh.|ba
A|and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.|sd
B|That's right.|ba
A|But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,|sd
