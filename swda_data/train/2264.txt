A|Well, since you live close, I don't know if you know, um, about what Louisville is doing with recycling,|sd
A|or are you familiar with any of that?|qy
B|Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, like the area in there,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I read, you know,|%
A|when they first started doing that in the paper, and I read about that,|sd
A|I was just praying that, that would be in our area, because we've been recycling for quite some time.|sd
A|And, you know, we separate everything out, and then have to haul it up to a Metco , you know, which is a real pain.|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|So if they would come up, curbside recycling,|sd
B|they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.|^2
A|Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Oh, God.|ba
B|Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons|sd
B|and there was nowhere else to take them|sd
B|and they had it in front of Wal-Mart|sd
B|and I ask in Wal-Mart|sd
B|and they said they moved it just behind.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing.|sd
A|Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great.|sd
A|And we started taking them up there.|sd
A|And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know|sd
A|I didn't know.|sd
A|And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's really nice to find out that it's behind there|sd
A|Well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers.|sd
A|I couldn't even think of what you call them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.|sd
B|Like aluminum cans?|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|ny
B|That's about what we do too.|sd
A|And really, that's about, that's really about it.|sd
A|Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?|qy
B|Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.|na
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,|sd
A|I know.|ba
B|I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.|sd
A|I know.|ba
A|I know.|ba
A|We're kind of the same way.|sd
A|You know, at first, you know, you,|%
A|at first it was a real, it was a real hassle,|sd
A|and I'm wondering are we really going to do this,|sd
A|but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know. So I just go, you know,|%
A|we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen|sd
A|and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there,|sd
A|you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
B|Those milk cartons take up so much room.|sd
A|Oh, they do, too.|ba
A|And they're impossible to crush.|sd
A|I mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know.|sd
A|If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily,|sd
A|so. You know,|%
B|I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.|sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|We were using baby food|sd
B|and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Some of our neighbors were doing it|sd
B|and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it,|sd
B|and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there,|sd
B|and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff|sd
A|Oh, that will be good.|ba
B|so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Let somebody get something out of it.|^2
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|ba
B|And they won't raise our taxes.|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah .|b
A|Ha-ha|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, I was kind of hoping with,|sd
A|you know, do you work for T I?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I don't.|sd
B|I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,|sd
A|No.|b^m
A|Yeah.|b
A|There was a,|%
A|T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs.|sd
A|And, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here|sd
A|and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know,|sd
A|and that's,|%
A|they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program.|sd
A|It's,|%
A|you know, T I doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that.|sd
A|And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm kind of like, yeah.|sd
A|I shall,|%
A|they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. That was going to use it for good,|sd
A|so,|%
B|is talking to someone in Sorry.|fa
A|Sounds like you have a little one just like I do|sv
B|She'll be two in July.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
