B|Oh, did you see that?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too,|sd

B|Has he had, has he had very many other movies out?|qy
A|He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE|na
A|and there was one right before that with a similar title|sd
A|like, uh, I don't know some, I don't know, some macho title.|sd

B|Yeah,|b
B|did you ever see, um, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?|qy
