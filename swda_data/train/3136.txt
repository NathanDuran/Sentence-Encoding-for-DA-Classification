A|or radio heard faintly in Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I guess first of all I'll just say we haven't done much, uh, gardening.|sd
A|We do lawn work all the time.|sd
A|But, uh, our gardening we lost,|sd
A|remember the last two freezes,|qy^d
A|I don't know how long you've been here|qy^d
B|Yeah|ny
B|I do|sd
A|But we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones.|sd
A|And so, as far as our bushes, we don't have any|sd
A|but we do have some blackberry bushes.|sd
A|And  and they were really hearty and stayed on|sd
B|Oh,  really.|b
A|and we've done really well with them.|sd
B|Did you plant those yourself?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh.|b
A|And so they've been really good|sd
A|and the kids, I had to,|sd
A|the first year I had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries.|sd
A|But, uh, we go out,|sd
A|it, it's hard to go out when it's this hot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, but, uh, keep the weeds out of them and, and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them.|sd
A|And they're okay.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
B|That's nice.|ba
B|I, I love blackberries|sd
B|and we, uh,|%
B|when I was smaller, we, my family lived in Tennessee|sd
B|and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick, my brother and I.|sd
B|But, I don't have any down here.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh, we have some flowers that have,|sd
A|they're just are real hearty also,|sd
A|and they're bold|sd
A|and they come up every year|sd
A|but, uh, they're getting too thick,|sd
A|I need to go thin them out.|sd
A|I don't know what kind of flowers they are.|sd
A|They're real common around here.|sd
A|They're, they're orange|sd
A|and they look like a lily, sort of.|sd
B|Oh,  I think I know what they,|sv
B|I can't remember what the name of them are either.|sd
A|No,|nn
A|but I think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in.|sd
A|They, they keep the, the rain on the outside, little rain drops|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, and they look real pretty after the rain.|sd
A|And so I really like them|sd
A|but I need to get out and, and, um, do that.|sd
A|Now as far as our grass, it grows crazy here.|sd
A|It just keeps growing and growing|sd
A|and sometimes my son does it.|sd
A|But it just is,|%
A|I don't, I don't know.|h
A|I've lived in Utah my whole life|sd
A|and we can't seem to get ours green.|sd
A|I don't know.|h
B|Down here, the  grass?|br
A|Yeah|ny
B|Well, I'm,|%
B|we've had problems with our yard.|sd
B|We,|%
B|it was one big weed is what it was.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was just horrible.|sd
B|And my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns|sd
B|and we have this God awful ugly  thing.|sd
B|And   and I know they must think,  you know, I wish those people would do something about their yard.|sd
A|Crappy   I know,|^2
A|we have that too.|sd
B|But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that, that seems to be helping|sd
B|and he put it on the front yard to see how, you know, it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But we've got a Great Dane in the back|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she has eaten everything I have put out there.|sd
B|She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees.|sd
A|Oh dear.|ba
B|I know,|ba
B|and she's eaten the bushes.|sd
B|I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there|sd
A|No.|nn
B|and I barricaded it up, so she couldn't get into it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I went and took a shower and looked back out there|sd
B|and she was already in it.|sd
B|And I was so mad.|sd
A|Had somehow gotten in.|bf
B|So I can't do anything  back|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I've tried out in the front|sd
B|but like you said that, that freeze that came.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I had some bushes that, uh, some shrubs I put out front|sd
B|and it killed those too.|sd
B|So, I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing.|sd
B|I just don't even want to do anything.|sd
A|The, the other problem that we have,|sd
A|well it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived|sd
A|and so I, I don't know.|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|that, that happened to us.|sd
B|We have these,|sd
A|So like I wanted to go out and kill them too.|sd
B|I know.|ba
A|They had no right to live.|sd
A|But anyway, uh, under our trees we get a, a north sun|sd
A|and, uh, the,|%
A|it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them.|sd
B|Oh, I know.|ba
B|Ours don't.|sd
A|And we just can't  grow, uh, grass underneath there.|sd
B|I know,|ba
B|we can't either.|sd
B|But I've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. Uh, you know one on either side of the yard.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and they're big|sd
B|and they're real full and everything, you know, in the summer time|sd
B|but it, it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but toward the end of the summer, you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing.|sd
B|But, by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops.|sd
B|You know,  it's, it's  it's a never ending  cycle.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|It's  a vicious cycle, isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it really is.|sd
A|It just really,|sd
B|So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot.|sd
B|So,|%
A|Well, I don't,|%
A|we've never done anything like this|sd
A|but we've been thinking, you know, if we built up, uh, you know, either a wood, wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers, or, or some new bushes in there that would live.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I think that we're going to try that.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I,  I think the I think that's pretty much what we have decided.|sd
A|Now I have two long windows|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Really|b
B|well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front|sd
B|and they've got mini-blinds and stuff.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But only, only one is really like in the flower bed part|sd
B|and the other one is out on the porch.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So there's not really much I can do about that.|sd
A|That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows.|sd
A|One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son|sd
A|and one is, uh, an office that my husband and I work in.|sd
A|And so, I, I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that,|sd
A|well, the flowers are out by the back of the house,|sd
A|so, and that's why the front room is.|sd
A|So that's not too bad.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I like to look at the flowers.|sd
A|They're pretty.|sd
B|I do too,|aa
B|that's why I look at my neighbors yard|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't have anything to look at|sd
B|so I look at theirs.|sd
A|But it's funny because, uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, anyway I do, to do our yard|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or  yours  to them|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|or and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back|sv
A|and|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|It, it's really a pain.|sd
B|My husband works a lot|sd
B|so, um,  a lot,|sd
A|It's hard  to get out a lot and do that yard work.|^2
B|Yeah|b
B|I'm,|%
B|it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard|sd
B|and and I just I really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else.|sd
B|I hate to mow that yard.|sd
A|I know.|ba
A|It is, it's not my favorite, thing in the world either.|sd
A|I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well mine's getting there.|sd
B|He helps,|sd
B|he does half|sd
B|and I do half,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|Well that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out,  outside,|sd
B|Oh sure I'll be more then glad  to pay him  if he'd  just go out there and do it and, and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
B|That,  that's my only thing with him.|sd
A|Exactly.|aa
B|That's  why I'm help, having him help me now fade at end of|sd
