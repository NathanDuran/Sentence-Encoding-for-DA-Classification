B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|What can we do about crime?|qw
B|I don't know.|h
B|The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're, they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people|sd
B|and they keep letting out people that have, you know, these horrible records.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something.|sv
B|That's one thing I guess I could think of|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, it's definitely a big concern,|sv
B|I mean every day it's, you know, all|%
B|we live in a little small town,|sd
B|and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time.|sd
B|And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I,|%
B|So it's pretty scary.|sv
A|I'm, I'm from Butler,|sd
A|and I can't say that there's too much of that there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I know the bigger cities have problems with it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I really don't know what we can do about it.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|Unless they start enforcing the, uh,|sv
B|It's rough, because|sv
A|like: t, t, t, t, uh, start giving more people death sentences.|sv
A|That's the only thing I can think of.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous.|sv
B|I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries|sv
B|and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.|sv
B|So that's definitely something.|sv
B|They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like, you know, from one month to ten years or something|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That would be one thing that, you know, I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties, you know, for certain crimes|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I, uh, I don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And one things that they're saying, now,|sd
B|are you going,|qy
B|are you a student|qy
B|or are you in the work force|qrr
B|or,|%
A|Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.|na
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um, lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much.|sd
B|And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.|sd
A|Well, not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in.|sv
B|And they don't really,|sd
A|You know, what I mean?|qy
B|Wow.|ba
A|A lot of times the girls don't even report it.|sd
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Um, I've heard of a few case up here,|sd
A|but I can't say that I've heard of, uh, you know, any significant amount.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|They say like only one in ten are reported.|sd
B|I believe it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's awful.|ba
B|So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.|sv
B|I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.|sd
B|But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So that's probably something else they could do.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know,|h
B|it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs, you know.|sv
B|And that's like as long as,|%
B|it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know,|sd
B|because these kids are saying why should I go to high school|sv
B|and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.|^q
B|So that's certainly a big problem.|sv
B|I don't know what the solution to that is.|sv
B|Having more drug treatment centers available.|sv
B|Jeez, I don't know.|h
A|Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I know a lot of people that partake in that.|sd
A|And I'm not saying they're bad people,|sd
A|but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because it ends up,|%
B|even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know,|sv
B|huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up, on drugs,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's definitely got to do with crime.|sv
B|You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.|sv
B|I mean, just, oh,|%
B|gosh, horrible stuff like that.|sv
B|One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They said, uh, some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack,|sd
B|and their moms are crack users.|sd
B|So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I don't know who's the victim there.|sd
B|I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.|sv
B|And, it's a very complicated problem.|sv
B|I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. Gosh.|sd
A|No, I don't either.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I guess that's about all I have to say.|sd
A|Uh,|%
B|Is there anything else you would want to,|qy
A|No.|nn
B|Okay.|bk
A|I can't say that I, I just know that it's really bad in some areas|sv
A|and something's going to have to be done sooner|sv
A|but,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't, I don't know what they can do.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|It's frustrating.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well,|%
B|Okay.|fc
B|Well,  thanks for talking.|fc
A|It was nice talking to you.|fc
B|Have a good day.|fc
A|You too.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye, bye.|fc
