A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Um, yeah.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|We're official now,|sd
A|yeah,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's um, it's very hot,|sd
B|in fact I've been cleaning, because I live in an apartment|sd
A|Oh, okay,|b
B|so I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening um, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|I have the little flower boxes with, um, a a lot of different flowers,|sd
B|and I do enjoy plants,|sd
B|but I don't have a yard or anything that I can do gardening, really.|sd
A|Oh, you're, you're, you're not the so-called|%
A|you need a house, I guess, to go through all of that.|sv
A|I have had a couple of houses,|sd
A|and, uh the only recommendation I would have for someone who hasn't gardened is, uh, one, get a couple of good books, of books, of course,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and usually they have talk shows.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Here in Dallas they have two great, uh, talk shows that go through everything that will grow here, which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|and so. Uh in fact, you, you could easily do that now, listen to, turn on a talk show up there and see if there, there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in, and, and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything,|sv
B|Yes,|b
B|but,|%
A|so I, uh,|%
A|for someone who doesn't garden, I'd say, that, that's my biggest recommendation is to,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|so you enjoy gardening?|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
A|I like it a lot, uh uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's a lot of work.|sd
A|I'm an engineer,|sd
A|I'm, I'm with T I.|sd
A|You,|%
A|are you with T I up there|qy
A|or,|%
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|I'm with a defense contractor.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Uh, where was, oh,|t1
A|yeah,|%
A|no,|nn
A|I, I like it,|sd
A|I, uh, I always know that why I'm not a farmer when I garden though,|sd
A|I mean, it is dog work,|sv
A|and it is tough|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I have a lot of trees, down here, uh,|sd
A|the part I don't like, I guess, would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves forever it seems like,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours,|sd
A|so other than that, you know, those three months, when it's pure dog work uh, the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of, of putting little plants in or whatever|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I haven't had to plant any trees because I've got so many,|sd
A|but, uh uh, but I do listen to that talk show.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There, there is some great people from Texas A and M,|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|maybe you've heard of A and M down here,|qy^d
A|but there's some great, uh, folks, uh that have been well trained, and, again, uh, to, to, uh, recommend gardening for this area.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um. Yeah,|b
B|I'm sure it is, you know, different in the different areas.|sv
B|Um, I'm originally from Pennsylvania,|sd
B|and I do go home on weekends during the Summer and, uh, and, uh, mow my mother's grass and different things like that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you probably have rye grass up there.|sv
A|We grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here.|sd
B|Oh, I would have no idea|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|%
A|see, you would have to learn that, though,|sv
A|see|%
B|No idea whatsoever.|sd
B|Like I said, I'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill,|sd
A|Um.|b
B|and,|%
A|Do you have much luck in the Winter,|qy
A|or they're, they're freeze it, freeze out because the roots are all, in the Winter, uh,|qrr
A|or do you have to start all over every year?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I have to start all over every year|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|%
B|well, except, I do have some, um, some day lilies that um, you know, I don't do anything with|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they seem to come back year after year,|sd
B|and I leave them on my balcony even in in the snow and the Winter, you know in the ice, everything, because here, you know, not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania,|sd
A|In the same pot,|^2
A|that's amazing.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I grow a few things in pots,|sd
A|but we have to bring them in here in the Winter because usually, uh, if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know, the pots will, will die,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|everything in a pot will die|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, you can bring them,|sd
A|well, we do bring stuff in the garage and everything|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, it's quite time consuming, by the way.|sd
A|I don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything,|sd
A|but it's quite, uh.|%
A|But I would definitely do it,|sv
A|I'm all for doing everything,|sv
A|whether,|%
A|whatever subject you pick, do it the knowledgeable way|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|don't go out there and start digging holes, uh,|ad
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|I agree with that.|aa
A|Get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia as, as well as,|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|not your neighbors, of course, they usually know nothing|sv
A|then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications, as well as, I bet there's a talk show up there right now that you, if you turn the dial around you'll,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|on Saturday,|sd
A|this is Saturday,|sd
A|that|%
A|you'll find someone, probably in the morning, I don't know discussing, you know, what we do up in Virginia to get something growing|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|you probably don't have to do much over there,|sv
A|the soil's probably so good|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|our soil's not very good down here.|sv
A|We're|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess in the ice age, it, it, it's pushed a lot of, uh, limestone and everything, to some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone, you know|sv
B|Wow, uh-huh.|ba
A|so, uh, I think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees, where people have come from,|sv
A|I'm sure the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas,|sv
A|it's so scrubby uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from Alabama and all that, too|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we, we call them native pecan trees|sd
A|but, they grow wild here,|sd
A|they're eating pecans though|sd
A|Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia,|sv
A|they're probably only in the South for pecan pie and all that,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|right|b
B|I'm,|%
A|it's what they call pecan, pecan pie up there in the East.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|from Pennsylvania and New Jersey,|sd
A|I'm from New Jersey originally.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|oh, you don't sound like it|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've worked on that with a little chewing gum, which I shouldn't do, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|Go ahead,|ad
A|you, how many times have you called by the way,|qw
A|or how many times have you been called?|qw
B|Um, I've been called a lot,|sd
B|at the times, though, it's been not very appropriate,|sd
B|I guess, that I haven't been able to actually participate.|sd
B|I've participated probably in about maybe, I don't know, seven calls|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you know, I've called a couple of times,|sd
B|but most of the time I notice that, um, you know, it takes forever to get a call through.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|today,|%
A|that's what I'm saying,|sd
A|today, I was, I got to laugh, because I tried it this morning,|sd
A|and I thought everybody was gardening,|sd
A|I thought,|%
A|Well, no|nn
B|Yeah.|b
A|no.|nn
A|This is a great subject because they're out there gardening, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I didn't tell you what our weather is like.|sd
A|It is beautiful here today,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's like eighty-five degrees here,|sd
A|It's not quite that hot.|sd
A|Yeah,|%
A|we've had a real nice mild Spring.|sd
A|You might have seen, if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|I haven't|sd
A|Uh, I don't know if you get C N N.|qy^d
A|I don't get C N N|sd
A|but it's here at work|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|in fact, I'm at work today, believe it or not.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, they have T V in the break areas|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there was some heavy tornados, uh, I guess in Kansas,|sd
A|quite a few people were killed.|sd
A|You'll see that on the evening news.|sv
B|Oh, my, uh-huh.|ba
A|Uh,|b
B|I'll have to make sure I catch that.|oo_co_cc
A|Tornados, uh, which is not the right subject,|sv
A|but, uh, they blow through here all in the Spring.|sd
A|I guess it's related somewhat to the weather, you know and, and the plants and all that, that, uh|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|sometimes they do essentially nothing,|sd
A|and the weather men yesterday were all alert,|sd
A|say, hey, there's something really terrible going to happen,|sd
A|and they, they sure were right,|sd
A|but it wasn't in Texas,|sd
A|it was north of us.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|%
A|look at the news tonight,|ad
A|they'll, they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City, Kansas,|sd
B|I'll have to make sure I catch that,|oo_co_cc
B|Uh, Uh-huh.|b
A|Anyway, back on planting.|ad
A|Uh, . It is very interesting, uh, subject,|sd
A|uh, when you, when did you get a house, uh,|sd
A|your, your trees grow up so well up there,|sv
A|but I'm sure you have plenty of trees.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That, that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess you have mostly pine trees,|sv
A|but where in Virginia are you all?|qw
B|Um, right now, the District,|sd
B|Washington|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um, in Fairfax, Virginia.|sd
B|It's fifteen miles west of Washington, D C.|sd
A|Oh, do you have the cherry blossoms there, in there or not?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|there's, there's a few,|sd
B|not, you know, nearly as many as what's actually in the District.|sd
B|But, um, they're definitely enjoyable.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|azaleas grow all over,|sd
A|we grow those here, too,|sd
A|although again, we have to prepare the soil.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You probably have nice big pine,|sv
A|you probably have all kinds of trees, the oaks and everything,|sv
A|that's one thing I noticed there.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|there, there, there is a vast variety here of, you know, trees,|sd
B|like, if I look out my window right now, I can see, you know, couple of pine trees, some oak trees|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Have you ever been down here?|qy
B|Um, no,|nn
B|actually I haven't.|sd
A|Okay,|bk
A|it's interesting country.|sd
A|It is wide open, uh, and flat|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, and again as I said, I think the, when the Indians were here there, there weren't any trees,|sv
A|but the, the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees,|sv
A|and a lot of them have done well|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, they do have some pine forest areas in in in east Texas where you have native pine trees,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but here in Dallas it's, I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed, and Johnny Pecanseed, whatever you would call it, you know,|sv
A|there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for, you know, uh, for eating|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop, uh, hundred and fifty years ago, because they are all over the place in the South.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|What else?|qo
B|Um, well, I guess that I really don't know that much.|sd
A|I don't have any say.|sd
A|I, I,|%
A|the subjects are usually pretty interesting.|sd
A|I, I'm, I'm, of course, I'm a T I|sd
A|so I'm hoping this works.|sd
A|T I is very good, uh, has done a lot of experiments in the speech, uh speech, uh, synthesis, synthesis,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|can't say it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they've come out with some new products,|sd
A|in fact this week, they came out with some new math, uh,|sd
A|you might see them in your advertisements, uh,|sv
A|new math, uh,|sd
A|Speak and Math, uh, devices.|sd
A|They, they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but they've come out with some different ones this past week,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, my wife and everyone,|sd
A|what, what are they going to accomplish out of all this,|sd
A|and I said, Well, you're not going to have to type on the computer one day,|sv
A|you're just going to have to talk to it you know,|sv
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|so, you, you,|%
A|it's going to be much faster, of course, you know,|sv
A|the classical thing for the handicapped, too, person who can't type very fast|sv
A|or|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|like I can of course|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|not that I can type very fast either|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|but then what about people that, um,|qw
B|I, I, I personally work with someone that, that is deaf, and cannot speak.|sd
B|She can speak,|sd
B|but she can't speak very clearly|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and she in fact is a data entry person,|sd
B|I mean she types away all day,|sd
