A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|do you, uh, think we should go metric?|qy
B|Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.|no
B|It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens|sv
B|and things make sense.|sv
B|Um, it's, it's a switch.|sv
B|The problem would just be the switch over.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I think that the, I think what,|sv
A|I mean, I don't know what happened last time.|sd
A|I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something|sd
A|and,|%
B|Right.|aa
B|That's when I was in the elementary school years|sd
B|and we all, We all learned that metric|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|me too.|sd
B|and they were ready,|sd
B|we were going to be metric|sd
B|and,|%
A|Right,|aa
A|and, and I don't quite know why it failed.|sd
A|Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,|sd
A|so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out|sv
A|so,|%
B|So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.|sd
B|We have metric cola now,|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.|sd
B|you can buy that|sd
B|and you can,|sd
A|You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.|sd
B|So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,|sd
B|but no one talks about, you know, uh,|sd
B|you buy nine by twelve frames,|sd
B|you don't buy centimeter length frames, and cooking pans.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers,|sd
A|you don't say,|sd
A|I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.|^q
B|Uh-huh .|b
B|Right,|b
B|fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I would, I would be total loss.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's,|%
A|I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed|sv
A|and, pardon my expression there, but, uh, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it really would.|sv
B|It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could I mean|sv
B|because I think our generation could make a change.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It would be difficult,|sv
B|but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|That's|%
A|Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And if they kept it up,|sv
A|so let's say, imagine they had kept going,|sd
A|you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Not like could use it comfortably right now,|sv
A|but I could convert, you know,|sd
A|I could carry around a little conversion card or something|sd
A|and, I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn,|sd
B|Right|b
A|and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And now I think there are enough people,|sv
A|you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,|sv
A|and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.|sv
A|We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck,|sv
A|but it's for the better|^q
A|and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|That makes sense.|sv
A|I don't know.|h
A|I, I, I would hope it would, uh,|sd
A|it seems like it's a reasonable system.|sv
A|I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.|sv
B|Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,|sd
B|and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.|sd
A|Right|b
B|When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,|sd
A|Centimeters.|b^m
B|and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|But I wonder if, if,|sd
B|So all the dieters would be happy|sv
A|But yeah|b
A|right|b
B|I only weigh sixteen today.|^q
B|That's,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.|sd
A|They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,|sv
A|so start, you know, from now,|sv
A|like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that, tells you how tall the robbers are when they, to hold it up.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|I know the,|sd
A|and, oh, yeah,|%
A|I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You have to be under.|^q
A|Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh,|sd
A|see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.|^q
A|That's right.|aa
B|Just so you'll know,|^q
A|It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?|qy
B|I know England is not metric.|sd
A|But I don't know.|no
B|I, I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in England,|sd
A|England is not?|qy^d
A|Oh.|b
B|all that began back there,|sd
B|and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I mean,|%
A|but, but virtually the rest of the world is.|sd
A|I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans|sd
A|and we're supposed to be, you know,|sv
B|We're the trend setters in the world.|^2
B|I don't know why we, We haven't changed to the sensible system.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|and, and now we're backwards.|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything,|sd
B|is it?|^g
B|It,|%
A|No,|nn
A|actually, no.|nn
A|Um, let's see,|^h
A|it's,|%
B|Well, pounds,|sd
B|I don't even know what that,|sd
A|I don't know.|h
A|Oh, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I always forget.|sd
A|I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.|sd
A|I just sort of make it up.|sd
B|See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.|sd
B|It's,|%
B|I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from,|sd
A|Right|b
A|Those, those wouldn't be a problem.|sv
B|It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.|sv
B|A lot of stuff,|sv
A|Let's see,|^h
A|how many cups equal that?|qh
A|I, I have no idea.|sd
A|I just, uh,|%
A|I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.|sd
B|Right|b
B|I don't, I didn't even know that|sd
A|That's all I know.|sd
A|I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine,|sd
A|I, I had two friends,|sd
A|and, I had more friends than that,|sd
A|but two friends of mine in college,|sd
A|I had a lot more than two,|sd
A|I promise.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Um, we opened a jelly bean business.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And we sold jelly beans,|sd
A|and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know,|sd
A|we, we didn't we didn't bother buying a scale.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And we, we didn't bother buying a scale,|sd
A|and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major|sd
A|and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around,|sd
A|and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.|sd
B|Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?|qy
A|Gee, I think, I think he the calculation at home,|sd
A|and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, so we were giving them a little too much,|sd
A|but that was our general tendency anyway.|sd
B|Well, that's,|%
B|you all are nice business|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, we were, you know, we were in,|sd
A|it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school,|sd
A|we really didn't, make, you know,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after, after an entire semester,|sd
B|Right|b
A|but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.|sd
B|Probably ate all your merchandise too.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we, we, we tended to eat a lot,|sd
A|and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it,|sd
A|and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he got into a snowball fight, with the jelly beans nearby,|sd
A|and he just,|sd
A|and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off|sd
A|And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's a little problem.|sv
B|What's inside the jelly bean?|qw
A|Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same,|sd
A|they're like an outer coating,|sd
A|and there's just sort of this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar.|sd
A|I don't know.|h
B|Uh, oh.|b
A|But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,|sd
