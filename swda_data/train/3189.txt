B|Hi, Clarice.|fp
B|Um, have you had a family reunion recently?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|just this last summer we went back to Utah,|sd
A|and we met, it was my,|sd
A|we usually go to my family reunion,|sd
A|but this one was my husband's|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they're usually quite similar, I think.|sd
B|Are you both from Utah originally?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|he's from here|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|bk
A|but, uh, most of his people are from Oregon,|sd
A|so we kind of met halfway|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so, this was one,|sd
A|and they, um, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had, you know,|sd
B|Oh, how nice.|ba
A|things like that have to be planned,|sv
A|like they had planned|sd
A|that, we went to the reunion in end of June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but we had to plan everything like clear in December, January to reserve that.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|sure,|b
B|Now was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles like that or his immediate family?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No|nn
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|this was everybody.|sd
B|Oh wow,|ba
B|how many people were there?|qw
A|Oh, I, oh, I, jeez, I think over, um, three hundred were there.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|It was quite a large|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|it was a great big lodge,|sd
A|and so we had plenty of room and everything,|sd
A|and some of them live in that area,|sd
A|so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, um, that was a great big thing,|sd
A|and we do that with his family about every five years,  a great big one.|sd
A|And then like immediate family we do, like we try to do one thing once a year.|sd
B|Now how many, how many people are in his immediate family?|qw
A|Well, he has eight brothers and sisters|sv
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|so that's big by itself.|sd
B|Wow,|ba
B|it really is,|aa
B|and you get together once a year.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Wow,|ba
A|So we have a little shindig with them.|sd
B|Are they all here in the area,|qy
B|or are they scattered?|qrr
A|Um they're close, in a close proximity.|sd
A|Um, let's see,|^h
A|there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, um, the others live in close neighboring, um, states, like Nevada, Arizona I think like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|yeah|%
B|Oh wow,|ba
B|that's wonderful.|sd
A|so, it's been fun.|sd
A|How about you?|qo
B|Well, we don't really get together,|sd
B|I, I would love to,|sd
B|and that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime.|sd
B|Um, I have a sister in Colorado, and, uh, a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in Connecticut, and here I am in Texas.|sd
B|So we're kind of scattered right now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, my, my cousins have a, you know, they put on a family reunion, um, once a year,|sd
B|but it's always like the second week in September,|sd
B|so it's,|%
B|the kids are already back in school|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, and that's back in the|sd
A|That's hard.|ba
B|and that's in New York,|sd
B|and there's no way, I mean there's just no possible way.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it's not really a weekend,|sd
B|it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are, you know, um,|sd
B|my family moved to Connecticut,|sd
B|the rest of the family stayed in New York and, uh, on Long Island,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, they're all kind of local and close,|sd
B|and so they just have a, you know, a day picnic,|sd
B|and, uh, I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|that would be so wonderful|sd
A|It really is fun,|sd
A|and my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|once a year, um, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing.|sd
A|You can come and go as you please type thing.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And they do that once a year.|sd
A|I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad,|sd
A|but you can't go every year,|sv
A|you just cannot do that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um.|b
B|And do they, they have a hotel,|qy
B|or where do you stay?|qrr
A|Um, basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters.|sd
A|There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out.|sd
B|Take everybody,|^2
B|yeah.|%
A|Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them,|sd
A|like I go stay with my mother,|sd
A|and my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad, you know kind of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And so it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
A|so that's not hard,|sd
A|but the real planning, that's the real key|sd
B|Oh, that sounds so wonderful,|ba
B|isn't that nice.|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they send out,|sd
A|my mom's family now,|sd
A|this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,|sd
A|but my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year,|sd
A|and that's how they divide it up|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|But then one brother and sister from each family.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and each one of them take their turn.|sd
B|Oh, wow,|ba
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And then the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is her children help her,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing.|sd
B|Oh, I see, uh-huh.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, wow,|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|and, um, the thing is, that, um, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out,|sd
A|and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making,|sd
