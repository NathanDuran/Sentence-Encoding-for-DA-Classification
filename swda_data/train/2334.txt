A|Yeah,|b
A|as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|they did.|sd
A|And, uh, course, I guess, I guess I've been purged from their records.|sd
A|I used to have an American Express.|sd
A|Uh, back when I had my business I got one.|sd

A|So I didn't do anything about it.|sd
A|Two weeks later I get another letter, even nastier,|sd
A|and said, We're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay.|sd
