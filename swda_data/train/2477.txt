A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|so which, uh, what basketball teams are you interested in?|qw
B|Well, I guess I'm a big Laker, L A Laker fan, when it comes to pros.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the college ranks, um, I guess I really,|sd
B|of course I try to follow my alma mater,|sd
B|that's, uh, B Y U, in Utah.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|But they don't have much of a team usually.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|they're more of a football team than they are basketball team.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|You see them in football on T V once in awhile.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You never see them on a, on nationally basketball.|sd
A|You know, that's true.|aa
A|I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball.|sd
B|They, uh, last year they had a really good team,|sv
B|the year that Danny Aines was there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That was about five, six years ago by now.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|So, they made it to the sweet sixteen, once or twice, in their history,|sd
A|Um.|%
A|That's not too bad.|sv
B|and that's,|%
B|and they usually lose in the first round.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, I'm, uh, originally from the Saint Louis area,|sd
A|so the only basketball team, pro anyway, in that part of the country is Chicago.|sd
A|So, I, I do pull for Chicago.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, of course, this year is a good year to be a, a Chicago fan, I guess, because they're doing pretty good.|sv
B|Is it the Bulls you're talking about?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|the pro,|bf
A|Um, as far as college teams, uh, I know it's really easy to say,|sd
A|but I've been pulling for, uh, Duke for about four years now|sd
A|so, uh, so, I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams. Although, I've, I've really, you know,|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|again being from Saint Louis, I pull for Missouri.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, but they're on, uh, probation this year|sd
A|so you can't do much about that.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|no.|aa
A|But, uh,|%
B|So, did you watch the, uh, final four this year?|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
A|I watched every, uh, I watched all three games of that.|sd
B|Every game?|^2
A|And, uh, I was very pleased with all three games, because Kansas, uh,|sd
A|you know, I was pulling for Kansas on the other side,|sd
A|so it was real nice to have the, the teams that were there.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|Of course,  I wasn't really,|sd
A|I mean, I, I,|%
A|U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a, uh, uh, oh, I don't know, a macho team, you know,|sd
A|they just didn't seem, they seemed to think they were better than everybody else|sv
A|and, and maybe they were,|sv
A|but, um, I was real happy to see them get knocked off.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, I watched that game.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it was a good game.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It was a very close game, and hard fought game.|sd
B|And it just,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|it looked like U N L V may have had more, uh, talent,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, as far as playing together as a team that day, it didn't, Duke seemed to have them off balance.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that, uh, they didn't, couldn't,|sv
B|aren't they more of a running gun team ?|qy
A|U N L V,|b^m
A|yeah,|ny
A|they, they play the pro style, is, what I've always called it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|fast breaks  and things and,|sd
A|yeah,|aa
A|the fast breaks and, and,|b^m
B|They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed|sv
B|and,|%
A|Right.|aa
A|And, uh, U N L V wasn't used to that.|sd
A|Of course, I've, I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time,|sd
A|see I don't know if they were necessarily behind,|sd
A|but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, and, you know, that meant that they had to play a second half|sd
A|and they, they've not had to do that all  year|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|They didn't have, they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year|sd
B|and that, and that, so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that, right in, when it, when it counts so much.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|I mean Duke's schedule was, was so much harder than U N L V's that it, uh, it just made them a much tougher team  overall,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, that had to help them a lot.|sv
B|I think, I think that, that probably was the difference in that game.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know.|sv
A|So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will, uh,  will  win|qy
B|Well,|%
A|or,|%
B|I don't know.|no
B|Probably not.|nn
A|I mean, Portland's pretty  good. Um,|sv
B|Since Kareem's retired,  they  haven't had a center.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, they've got Perkins,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I don't think he's really been a super star for them.|sv
A|No.|aa
A|Well, he's, uh,|%
A|I don't,|%
A|I,|%
A|he, he to me is not a center,|sv
A|he's more of a, a real tall forward|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Uh,|%
B|So,|%
A|I think Magic does a,|sv
B|They'll make it,  you know,|sv
B|it, it's going to be a war between, uh, between Chicago and, uh, and, uh, uh, Boston Celtics.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|That's going to be a war.|sv
A|That sure is.|aa
A|It,|%
B|It's  going to be a great series.|sv
A|I think that's going to be one of those that's, uh, that's won by the home team, you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think.|sv
B|One of those two will probably be, um, in there,|sv
B|um, let me see,|^h
B|where does Detroit fit in?|qw
A|Detroit's in that same, uh, that, that same, uh, division.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I don't know,|h
B|those three,|sd
B|uh, Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|but as I heard, Isaiah came back this week.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, that might help them.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|They have the, they have the play-off experience,|sd
B|but,|%
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so does Detroit, I mean, so does Chicago. So all three of them do, with Larry Bird back, uh,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|you can never count the Celtics out  when Larry Bird's,  starting to click on all cylinders.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They say he's starting to do, starting to  play,|sd
A|He's, yeah  but he's been, yeah, but he's been kind of up and down all year.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|uh, one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in|sv
A|and then the next time he'll, you know, he can't seem to hit the side of a barn.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, I don't know,|h
B|Right.|b
A|I'm, I'm kind of, I'm not sure about him this year.|sd
B|Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well  that's when,   you do it.|sv
B|He's,   starting to be  more consistent, you know, right at the right time of the year.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, any dark horses I, uh, you know,|sd
A|Well,  the dark horses,|b^m
B|San Antonio,  San Antonio is the dark horse that could, could really flip in there,  I think.|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|that's,|%
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, anybody who has David Robinson, has got to have a chance anyway.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|He's got to be pretty much, you know,|sv
B|I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player, you know, when he,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|against any team he would dominate,|sd
B|but Robinson's getting up there where , every game, he's just,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|I mean, it looks like he's going in for a dunk|sd
B|and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|nobody's got enough beef, I guess, to challenge him when he's, when he's driving hard to the hoop.|sv
A|Huh.|%
B|He's, uh, he's,|%
B|too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well then, he's gone now|sd
A|so,  they don't have to worry about that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|for awhile anyway.|sv
A|Well, I thought he was gone period.|sd
A|I, I didn't read the story,|sd
A|but I, I, read that, uh,|sd
B|I heard he was suspended.  Because of his,|sd
A|Well, that might have been what it was,|sd
A|but I, I guess the  headlines said something about him, you know, that the Mavericks released him or something,|sd
A|I, maybe I misunderstood what they meant.|sd
B|Um. If they did, they'd still have to pay his contract|sd
A|Well, yeah|b
B|They may have done it.|sd
A|you never know.|sv
B|It was a lot of money.|sd
B|He was making like,|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|but,|%
B|I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month.|sd
B|That's what he was being paid, you know,|sd
B|he wasn't even playing.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, boy, what a good job he had|sv
A|That's what I think.|aa
B|He ruined  his sweet position|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm looking forward to the, the pro play-off, uh,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's coming up, isn't it.|qy
B|L A,|sd
B|yeah,|ny
B|San Antonio,|sd
B|who's the other one that's doing so well this year,|qw
B|is that  Portland?|qy
A|Portland.|na
A|Yeah,|ny
A|Portland.|na
B|Portland.|b^m
B|I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all,|sd
B|but all I can do is hear about,|sd
B|boy they have the seeing eye.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do they have|qw
B|Walter Davis and,|sd
A|They've got two, the two Johnson brothers|sd
A|or they're not brothers,|sd
A|but I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something,|sd
A|I forget how that works.|sd
A|But, um, like I said they're doing extremely good right now.|sv
B|Um.|%
A|Phoenix isn't doing too bad.|sv
A|So, It, it ought to be a real interesting play-off.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't think there's any clear pick, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird, and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They are two guys that seem to find a way when they,|sv
A|When it's on the line.|^2
B|When it's on the line, they seem to find a way. You know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, so, those are what makes a champion I guess.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, it's been nice talking to you.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
