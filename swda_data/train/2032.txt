A|How about, um, Pink Floyd?|qy
B|Sure,|na
B|yeah,|ny
B|I like them.|sd

B|Okay,|b
B|well, I just didn't know that much about music|sd
B|and I wasn't sure what kind of music.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|it's very hard|sv
A|because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, you know,|%
A|I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.|sd
B|What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about?|qw
B|What,|%
A|We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.|sd
B|Okay,|bk
B|like, give me some examples.|ad
A|Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company,|sd
A|what,|%
B|Oh, well, Bad Company's not bad,|sv
B|that's not,|%
A|well, they're like, for example, A C D C.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|A C D C|b^m
A|Why,|qo
A|have you heard of them?|qy
B|Yes|ny
A|Okay.|bk
A|And, stuff like that.|sd
A|That's, that's, that's not really hard rock.|sv
B|Well, okay.|b
B|Okay,|ba
B|I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.|sv
A|Okay.|bk
B|I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like Cinderella, you know.|sd
A|Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal.|sd
B|Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella|sd
B|But, I like A C D C's okay.|sd
A|But, see, for example, they have, see what,|sd
A|but other bands consider it like really hard rock.|sd
A|It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar,|sd
A|and the guitar is set like, really low,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|No,|b
B|I don't really care for that too much, I guess.|sd
A|and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music|sd
A|and then they start dancing around,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they just bump into each other,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, then, you knock people down,|sd
A|and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.|sd
B|Is that the kind of music that you like?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I don't like that music.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|But, that's, that's what they do.|sd
A|That's, that's what some people call like really heavy metal.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also.|sd
A|Like really, like heavy metal, is considered, like the words heavy metal|sd
A|and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, just hard rock has,|%
A|they, they don't talk about that,|sd
A|they just talk about, like, life in general.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.|qy^d
B|Oh, sure.|na
B|Of course.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|you, you're talking Queen,|bf
B|is that what you said?|br
A|Okay,|b
A|well, no.|ar
A|I said Queen's Reich,|sd
A|but, but, oh, but you got to like Queen also.|sv
B|Oh, oh, oh, okay,|bk

B|Well sure,|b
B|because Queen was real popular when I was growing up.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera?|h
A|Don't they have a,|qy
A|no|ar
A|let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in the background.|qw^d
B|Oh! Right,|ba
A|Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.|sd
B|right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that was great.|sv
A|I heard that the other day on the radio|sd
A|and I pumped it up.|sd
A|Because, I mean, I just love that song.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that, that was a real good one.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|but they had,|%
A|that, that whole record was pretty good.|sv
A|But then, they started going downhill like everybody else.|sv
B|Well, that's true.|aa
B|They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|they're, they're still around,|sd
A|they've got a new C D out,|sd
A|but I, I wouldn't buy it.|sd
A|Because see, what happens is, the old, see|sd
A|I like, I like the old Rolling Stones.|sd
A|I don't like the new stuff.|sd
B|Of the Stones?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
B|That's the|%
B|the older stuff is the best of it.|sv
B|The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I, don't really care for today's rock and roll too much.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yes,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this,|sd
A|and then he came out with, uh, see, for example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That was good,|sv
A|but it was on his way of going downhill,|sv
A|because he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone,|sd
A|and then he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis|sd
A|and that really,|%
A|like now, I hate Phil Collins,|sd
A|I can't stand him.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Because, I look at him|sd
A|and I say, you know, you were singing at this time, and with these people,|sd
A|and you were great,|^q
A|and now you're singing all this stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record,|^q
A|it's still going to be a number one hit.|^q
A|And so, that's, that's what gets me mad.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|not yet.|sd
B|I guess I've been, kind of considering it.|sd
B|Have you seen it yet?|qy

A|I saw it when it opened.|sd
B|Was it really good?|qy
A|Yeah. you know, like those guys that criticize movies?|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|na
A|And, they both loved the movie, right?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They said the music's great,|sd
A|it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that.|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, one of them said, well, everything is great,|sd
A|but I'm going to give it thumbs down.|^q
A|And they go,|sd
A|but why?|^q
A|Because it's like, the end is, like, really depressing.|sd
A|And so,|%
B|Oh.|b
A|But it, but it's like the movie is so well made,|sv
A|and the music that goes with it just picks you up, see,|sv
A|I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|So, I mean, so for me,|%
B|So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then.|bf

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Did, did you go to college?|qy
B|Well, no.|nn
B|I'm going right now|sd
A|Oh, that's cool.|ba
B|But uh, no|nn
B|I didn't go then.|sd
B|But see, I graduated high school in seventy-eight,|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really heavy, you know,|sd
B|and real, um, I don't know,|h
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|disco was pretty much dead by then.|sd

A|Him just standing there.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
