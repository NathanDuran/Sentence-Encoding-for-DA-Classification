A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, on this subject, I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet,|sd
A|but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I've always been involved, you know, in one.|sd
B|How do you feel about them, I mean, since you've kind of been close to that.|qo
A|Well, I've Well, I can kind of see both sides, you know,|sd
A|I really can.|sd
A|Uh, nursing homes to me,|%
A|I would personally be the last resort you know, I you know if I had to put someone in there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I've had a touch of experience.|sd
B|My, um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|if it's a have to thing,|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|I,|%
A|yeah.|aa
B|and, uh, she put him in,|sd
B|but he wasn't there very long before he died|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, um, I guess, um, the one time that I saw him there, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and that's always kind of bothered me.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that's like everything else, though.|sv
B|I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home,|sd
B|but I've never actually been there|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow, you know, a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|arp_nd
A|but,|%
B|But still I'm sure there are, you know, aspects to it that aren't really desirable.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I know,|sv
A|I've always,|%
A|well, my sister's involved in one also,|sd
A|and I really think they really do a wonderful job.|sv
A|But still there's those little things that happens, you know|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|there really is, which|sv
A|I think, it's a wonderful place, you know, if it comes to that, you know, if you just can't take care of them any more.|sv
B|Well, sometimes you don't have any other alternative|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that's it.|aa
B|family and friends are usually, well family's tied up with their own lives and things, and usually working|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Other things.|^2
B|and it's hard to,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|but I think when the time comes, I, I hope to have the time to really look around, you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I think that's important, too,|aa
B|in fact there's a,|%
A|I do too.|aa
A|Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|There's one close to where my mother is,|sd
B|but in order to get in, you have to be able to, um, walk in on your own,|sd
B|in other words, you can't be in, you know, too bad a shape to start out with.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But then if you deteriorate, um, they have a separate section for those who need care you know, all the time.|sd
A|yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But it's always, well,|%
B|and they have a long waiting list, too.|sd
B|So there's always this feeling of, well, golly gee, you know, you've got to be able to walk in the door,|sd
B|so you can't wait until you're too bad off|sd
A|Off,|b^m
A|yeah.|b
B|but then, you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like, uh, you have to give up your automobile or whatever.|sv
A|To,|b^m
A|no.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|and everything you worked so hard for all your life|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|yeah.|%
B|and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things, then you feel like, well, gee, I'm, you know, I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's kind of a, that's a hard one,|sv
B|but it is a very nice nursing home.|sd
A|Now there is some really nice ones.|ba
A|There's also, you know, some private ones, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but of course, I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that, you know,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's the problem|sv
A|that's way out of my reach.|sd
B|the expense of it all is,|%
B|and, uh, what I, another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. You know|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
A|the very same,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|So I don't like that aspect.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|but I, there's, I think there's ways around it, though, that, you know,|sv
A|like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But still, a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that.|sd
A|You know, it's their money.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You know, that's how I feel about it, anyway.|sd
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|I've talked to my mother about that several times lately,|sd
B|and I, I said, I want you to have control of your own business.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|But, you know, what if.|qh
A|Yeah,|b
A|my mother's seventy now,|sd
A|so naturally she's retired,|sd
A|but she's still on her own, I mean.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|my mother's, uh, seventy-five and still has her own home and everything.|sd
A|I think that's wonderful,|ba
A|I really do,|ba
A|just as long as they can,|sv
A|and then on the other hand, I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's true.|aa
B|They have a lot of people around to do things with.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|they're not lonely.|sv
B|Some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on.|sd
A|Oh, yes,|aa
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And they'll take them places|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so. I don't know,|h
B|it's not all bad|sv
A|No.|aa
B|but I guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things.|sv
A|Around,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know,|sd
B|No.|b
A|I really don't.|sd
A|But no,|%
A|when the time comes I'm really, hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|really do,|%
A|because I have been raised in one, you know,|sd
A|so there's lot of things I know to look for.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I really don't.|sd
B|That might be kind of tough, huh.|sv
A|It really would,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|and like I said, my sister's still in it,|sd
A|and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.|sd
A|Oh.|b
