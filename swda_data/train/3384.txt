B|Yes,|ny
B|I do.|ng
A|I think that's the main change.|sv
A|What do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think that's a big part of it|sv
B|and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home|sv
B|and,  I  almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|But, but yeah, I think that's a big change|sv

A|and that's real hard.|sd
A|You have children?|qy^d
A|I assume so.|qy^d
B|Yes.|ny
B|I have two|sd
B|and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but as long  as I you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could,  as well as  I could et cetera.|sd
A|Right.|b

A|It's real hard.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|It's real hard.|bf
A|I mean even I,|sd
B|It's full time work.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It was so hard for me to work full time.|sd

A|Of course, my kids are, are a little older|sd
A|but then you, then you give up the money.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know?|qy
B|You do there's|%

B|but I just,|%
B|I,|%
B|the kids are so wonderful|sd
A|Yeah.|b

A|Yep.|b
A|Fine .|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yep.|aa

B|and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school,|sd
B|and she was there when we got home.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and,|%
A|Well,  I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,  which I loved.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm home when they are home.|sd
A|In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store,|sd
A|and I'm just really hesitating,  because  I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever,  so like  seventeen years with my kids.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|I mean, well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent|sd
A|and it was wonderful.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|My kids  and I, we just had a ball.|sd
B|See,|%
B|and I think,|sv
A|Of course, their,  their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|and we are just running every direction|sd
A|and,|%
B|But see,  it's such an important time to be home. You know.|sv
A|It is.|aa
B|And that,  was important to me enough,|sd
A|It is.|aa
B|you know, my husband was raised, uh,|sd
B|his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,|sd
A|Always worked.|b^m
B|and he's like  well, you know, what's the big deal about being home,  for your kids.|sd
A|What, yeah.|b^m
B|Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.|sd
B|I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed,  Mom  at school, you know, she was there to help|sd
A|Right.|b
B|or,  she was  there to take you,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, and I want to be able to do those things|sd
B|so.|%
A|I think that, you know, it's good.|sv
A|You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they,  come home|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over.|sd

A|But again I miss,  the .|sd
B|So, where do you see,  us changing in the future?|qw
A|I don't.|sd
B|Well, see that was one of the things the, the question I think is,  you know,  what changes do we see|sd
A|I keep on working .|sd
A|Right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere.|sd
B|I think they are still going to have to work.|sv
A|That we are because it's so expensive.|bf
A|If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then  there is the gas,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then  there is the lunches and then the day care.|sd
B|The day care eats,   me alive.|sd
A|You must pay for ,|sd
A|day care.|sd

A|Oh  my gosh.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|for two.|b^m
B|They would eat you,  alive.|sv
A|It's almost hardly worth it for you,  to work until they get in school.|sv
B|I know.|aa
A|Then you work summers unless you are a teacher.|sd
A|Are you a teacher?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I'm not,|ng

B|but it's still not the same.|sd
A|No.|aa
A|It's not the same.|b^m
B|It's just not.|sd
A|I, I don't see things changing really,|sd
A|and, and it's terrible for divorced women you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Thank goodness I have mine,|sd
A|and I could get a real good paying job,  if I wanted  to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Please come back to work.|b^m
A|and we'll pay you this .|^q
B|Sure.|b
A|Yeah,|b
