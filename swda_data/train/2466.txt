B|So,|%
A|Your name is Lynn?|qy
B|Linda.|ng
A|Linda.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, sounds like you like to read.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.|sd
B|I don't read as much as I would like to either.|sd
B|I'm, I'm a single mom,|sd
B|but I have always loved reading.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do you like to read?|qo
A|Um, well um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade,|^h
A|so most of my books are, um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.|sd
B|That what I've been reading lately a lot of.|sd
B|Um, my interests switch around dramatically.|sd
B|I used to read just, mainly fiction,|sd
B|and now I, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|What kind of things have you read?|qw
B|Oh, I read all kinds of things for, um, helping people survive a divorce.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.|sd
B|Have you read that?|qy
A|Uh, I haven't gotten through it yet.|ng
B|You haven't?|bh
A|No.|nn
B|Okay,|b
B|what would you recommend?|qw
A|Um, as far as dealing with divorce?|qy
B|Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.|ng
A|Good self help.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee|sd
B|Um, that sounds good.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's one that we use in our work.|sd
A|It's probably one you'd find in like a Christian book store.|sd
A|I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm writing it down.|sd
B|That does that's sound really good.|ba
B|Um, what kind of counseling do you do,|qw
B|or should we stay on the topic of books?|qy
A|Um, probably should stay on the topic,|na
A|but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read|sd
A|I'm a therapist for Rossa.|sd
A|It's a Christian treatment organization|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically,|sd
A|so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems.|sd
A|Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse,|sd
A|so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.|sd
B|Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves|sv
B|they're at a bad stage anyway,|sv
B|and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible, as a teen.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's, uh, that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that.|qy^d
A|Well, sometimes it's rewarding,|arp_nd
A|and, and sometimes it's a struggle.|arp_nd
B|Oh, I'm sure,|ba
B|I'm sure.|ba
B|Uh, what|%
B|is, is that just the only type of reading you've been doing,|qy
B|or do you, have you read any good novels lately?|qrr
A|Um, I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read|sd
A|it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, uh, reading, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.|sd
B|just joy reading.|^2
B|Yeah.|%
B|I hear you there,|ba
B|that's for sure. Um,|ba
A|In fact,|%
B|I guess, the last book I've read,|sd
B|my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I just realized I had never read it growing up.|sd
B|So, I just finished reading that for enjoyment.|sd
A|Um, that's neat.|ba
B|And it it was good.|sd
B|Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much,|sd
B|so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her.|sd
B|But I thought it was real interesting.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading.|sd
B|I know.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
B|Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books,|^h
B|but, I, I keep lists,|sd
B|I must have a list of, oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I want to read.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Just like, I want to read that and I write it down.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've got a stack next to my bed|sd
B|So do I.|sd
A|I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book|sd
A|and then I, I get distracted, and, or have to start on another one,|sd
A|it's pretty tough to keep up with.|sv
A|I was trying to think of,|sd
A|I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED|sd
A|but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read.|sd
B|Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's the one I was thinking of.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, I bought that one,|sd
B|and I didn't get into, involved in that one as well.|sd
B|There's another one he wrote that even sounds better,|sv
B|and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace, you know, like, and communities building communities.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Someone just recently said something really neat about that.|sd
B|Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends,|sd
B|and, uh, it was of the people from there that said that.|sd
B|His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent,|sd
B|and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.|sd
B|And he did, uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the, you know, one of the places.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|So, I've um,|%
A|That's interesting.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it, it really was.|aa
B|A real fun bunch of books that I read, uh, the beginning of last year were, um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I can't think of his name.|sd
A|Is it ?|qy
B|Pardon me|br
A|?|qy
B|uh, no, uh, oh,|nn
B|it'll, it'll come to me,|sd
B|but he wrote, he wrote the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.|sd
B|Those are mind expanding books|sv
A|Um.|b
B|His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of.|sd
B|I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though.|sd
B|But, uh, they, they were fun.|sd
B|They were real just books for fun.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?|qy
A|Um, not very long.|ng
A|I really just started.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|How did you get involved?|qw
A|My wife has been working for T I.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
B|I'm a former T I-er.|sd
B|I just recently quit.|sd
B|And so, uh, I got myself involved in a sales job,|sd
B|and right now, my list of books to be read have to do with, uh, the art of selling.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|So.|%
A|It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa|sd
A|they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read,|sd
A|and, I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.|sd
B|Never,|sv
B|never|sv
B|there's never going to be enough hours in the day.|sv
A|I don't think so.|aa
B|Even if you took speed reading. Huh.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I don't think so.|aa
B|So, well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.|^h
B|Do you like to read mysteries.|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|a little bit.|sd
B|Do you like Ken ?|qy
A|Um. Trying to think.|^h
B|He writes, uh, spy novels, THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable|sd
A|I like that kind of stuff.|sd
A|I think the last novel I read I read, I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.|sd
A|It was a, um, last name's ,|sd
A|it's called PIERCING, no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|It's, uh, kind of unusual book.|sd
A|It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.|sd
B|Oh that sounds interesting.|ba
B|like phone knocking against It sounds really good.|sv
B|Hey, you should make yourself a promise that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,|sv
B|and you kind of forget the fun of reading|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|very easily.|sv
B|So|%
A|Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.|sv
B|I think so, too.|aa
