A|So I own a, a P C A T at my home.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,|sd
B|I mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,|sv
B|well, who is this,|qw
B|what do you use yours at home for?|qo
A|Well, that's actually a good question.|arp_nd
A|My wife works out of the home, our home.|sd
A|She has an office|sd
A|and in fact she sits in the office|sd
A|and she uses it to compose and print out letters.|sd
B|Okay,|bk
B|well now.|%
A|So that's a very regular use of it that she has.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And in addition to that I tinker around with it.|sd
A|I'm a computer scientist.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|And so I write programs to do little things|sd
A|I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.|sd
A|And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.|sd
B|Uh, huh, well, excuse me, I, uh, uh, well I'm a technician, electronics tech.|sd
B|Years ago T I sent me to their, uh, computer school down in Austin.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, I learned to repair one|sd
B|but you know I never really learned to operate one.|sd
A|Oh, that's a key thing.|sv
A|Well, actually that's a,|%
A|there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today. That just require no programming.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|So that|%
A|in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming|sv
A|but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think you you really hit the nail on the head.|sv
A|For the average person is exactly what he can use it for.|sv
A|And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters|sv
A|or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,|sv
A|whatever|sv
A|there, your issue is then there really,|sv
B|Well, uh, space is a handicap with me,|sd
B|I live in a motor home.|sd
A|Oh, I see|b
A|well.|%
B|And I'm preparing for retirement.|sd
A|I see|b
A|well, congratulations on that.|ba
B|And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|definitely,|aa
B|but just like the computers.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Oh, the calculators you mean.|bf
B|I mean calculators,|na
B|I beg your pardon.|fa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they sure do.|aa
A|Yeah|aa
A|I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.|sd
A|You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.|sv
B|You're kidding.|bh
A|No.|nn
B|Including a printer?|qy
A|Well, actually I wasn't including a printer,|arp_nd
A|but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars|sd
A|so make it seven hundred.|sd
B|A hundred?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Wholly smoke,|ba
B|a respectable one?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,|sd
B|but I'm, I'm, that does amaze me.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|the prices had plummeted,|sd
A|you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,  the  box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|And then the keyboard is another fifty,|sd
A|the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred|sd
A|and then the disk drive is two fifty.|sd
B|Well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive.|qy
A|Well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,|arp_nd
A|you're buying these knock offs,|sd
A|so there's,|%
A|probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's a big magazine,|sd
A|it's twelve inches narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.|sd
A|But the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses|sd
A|and they're all competing with each.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer|sd
A|that that's called, it's the original P C.|sd
A|So it's,|%
A|we call the T I, I'm sorry an I B M P C compatible.|sd
A|And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.|sd
B|Uh.|b
A|And you mix and match|sd
A|and then you do it by mail-order.|sd
A|But there's no real brands|sd
A|it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.|sd
B|I see.|bk
B|How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?|qo
A|They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that that type of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.|sd
A|And like I said it's about an inch thick|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well, getting back to the P C|sd
B|I'll tell you,|^h
B|I ya,|%
B|first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.|sd
B|And secondly, I did learn this much about computers,|sd
B|they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.|sd
B|In binary.|sd
A|That's right|aa
A|There's great.|ba
B|Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.|sd
A|Oh, yeah|b
B|One and one equals ten.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's great.|b
B|Course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.|sv
A|I understand,|ba
A|that's great,|ba
A|that's a good joke.|ba
B|So what,|%
B|do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?|qy
A|I did for years|na
A|and then I was a scientist over in central research labs|sd
A|and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, now I I type that one,|sd
A|but I don't use it anymore.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well I just recently started using one.  In  connection with my work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|Uh, I keep track of an inventory here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|I agree.|aa
B|And, well I, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|See I'm with the Q R A lab. Qualification and evaluation|sd
A|Oh, I see|b
A|that's fascinating.|ba
B|so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  they're dated.|sd
B|So I have to keep up with them, uh,|sd
B|and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I just run a printout every week|sd
B|and and it puts me right up-to-date what I'm, what I have to do, what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So a,|%
B|it it is handy.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I must admit that up until I did start using one, uh, it was, I had very little interest in computers.|sd
A|Yes|b
B|But they are amazing.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they certainly are.|aa
A|So let's see, see|^h
A|so I guess with respect to the question,|sv
A|yeah,|%
A|I guess we've kind of covered it.|sv
B|I think we did.|aa
A|Great,|ba
A|nice little conversation with you Jack.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|Mike you take care now.|fc
A|Good day.|fc
B|Good luck  to you.|fc
A|Thank you.|fc
A|Same to you.|fc
