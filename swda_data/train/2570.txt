B|Why don't you go ahead and start.|ad
A|Okay,|aa
A|my hobby is, uh, sewing.|sd
A|I, I've just, uh, started learning how to sew|sd
A|and, uh, I've taken some classes|sd
A|and I've made a few, few garments.|sd
A|Do you sew at all?|qy
B|I used to, uh,|ng
A|Did you?|bh
B|I, I sewed, you know, in high school|sd
B|and when I went to college I think everything in my closet, I had made.|sd
B|But I haven't sewed since then|sd
B|and that's been fifteen years.|sd
B|So, uh, you know, I didn't have access to a machine the whole time I was in college.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, my sister sewed|sd
B|and she needed the money so I would pay her|sd
B|and she'd make my clothes|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, and then just in the last, you know, ten or I just haven't sewn anything.|sd
B|I would love to, I would like to get back to it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, clothes are getting so expensive now in, in the stores|sv
A|and the, the quality is, is sometimes so poor that, uh, it, it really is worth while to sew.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|It is, you know, an even back then,|sv
B|I remember you could make something for, you know, half what it cost to buy|sd
B|and, of course, the quality was just exceptional.|sd
A|Right an,|aa
B|Uh, now it's a little more expensive to make it, because, you know, you start paying the price for the patterns and the material,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it.|sv
A|It certainly is,|aa
A|and the patterns have gone up tremendously, too, the prices for them, you used to could get, you know, a pattern for two or three dollars, now, they're like, you know, five, six, seven, eight.|sd
B|You're kidding me.|bh
A|Oh, no,|nn
A|I'm not.|sd
B|See I can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern|sd
A|Huh-uh,|b
A|no,|%
A|the, the cheapest ones now are like maybe, uh, four or five dollars, six, seven|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you get into the Vogues,|sd
A|they get up into twelve and fifteen and, on like that.|sd
B|Good night.|ba
B|Well do you have kids and a husband,|qy
B|are you sewing for a whole family|qy
B|or,|%
A|Uh, right now I'm just sewing for myself.|sd
A|I, I do have two daughters that, you know, out, they're, they're grown now though.|sd
A|I wish that I had started sewing, you know, when they were younger.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, it would have helped me out tremendously|sd
A|But, um, oh, I guess, I, I just, you know, I always, I have always tried to sew|sd
A|and, uh, I didn't like the way it looked so I'd never wear anything.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But now I, I have bought some, uh, new, sewing equipment.|sd
A|I bought the Singer machine|sd
A|and, uh, it really makes it look professional|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I've taken some classes here in, in, uh, Dallas.|sd
B|Well and that always is helpful for starters.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I know a lot of people where I work make their clothes.|sd
A|It's just, there's just so many people sewing now days.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well do you do anything|qy
B|do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I'm not that talented.|sd
B|see, I'm I've not ever been a real craft type person.|sd
B|I have a sister-in-law that, I mean, if it can be done with your hands, she does it.|sd
B|She makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces|sd
B|and I look at them|sd
B|and I think, God, you know, I, I should be able to do things like this|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I have a sister that can, can, uh, crochet real well, or, or knit, I, I guess I mean knit.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And she knits things like hats, and, uh, sweaters, an, you know .|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, when my sister, oh, when my sister had her first, uh, child, my niece, and this is, we're talking fifteen years ago. I was, it was my last year of college,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares.|sd
B|So she did,|sd
B|and I crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And when we broke things off,|sd
B|actually we were supposed to get married when I got out of college.|sd
B|So when we broke things off, I quit crocheting it|sd
B|and I've never picked up a needle since then,|sd
B|in fact, I think it's still sitting in the top of the closet|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread|sd
B|But,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|now, now they have the, uh, knitting machines that will do it for you.|sd
B|Fast|bf
B|My problem, I guess is time, you know,|sd
B|I, I talk to my husband,|sd
B|we kind of planning for the time eventually when, you know, maybe I can quit work, while my kids, because, I, my kids are young.|sd
B|I have a three and a half and a two year old.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|And he says|sd
B|but Bev, I think you'll be so bored, because, you know, all you've ever done is work.|^q
B|And I said, but there's so many things I want to do,|sd
B|I'd like to start sewing again,|sd
B|I'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these, you know, knit these things|sd
B|and I think that would be fascinating.|sd
B|He kind of laughs|sd
A|Are you familiar with what a Serger is, uh, the Serger Sewing Machine?|qy
B|I don't think so.|ng
A|Well you know, in, when we used to sew, we'd sew the seam|sd
A|and then we'd finish the edges,|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|and we, we would, uh, trim the seams and finish the edges.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, this machine does it all in one step.|sd
B|You're kidding,|bh
B|so like as you're sewing the seam, it's finishing off the inside edge.|bf
A|Right,|aa
A|and it's cutting off the, uh,|sd
A|the, there, there are two knives|sd
A|and it cuts off the, uh, you know excess seam allowance.|sd
B|Well that takes all the work out of it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|And, uh, it, it really makes it look professional.|sv
B|Well, how neat.|ba
A|Especially, on, you know, I mean from the inside, you know how you look under, under something that you've made|sd
A|and it doesn't really,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, the Serger really makes it look professional.|sv
B|Well that's neat.|ba
A|They're pretty expensive.|sd
A|I like,|%
A|I paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine,|sd
B|For the machine,|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, since I bought it and paid that much for it, I guess I'd might as well get some use out of it.|sd
B|You have to learn how to do it.|bf
B|That's right.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|I'm going to have to do it.|sd
B|Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right|qy
A|Right.|na
B|Now I bought you that machine|^q
B|Well that sounds really good.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Do you paint or anything like that?|qy
A|No.|nn
B|Never.|bf
A|No,|aa
A|I, I play the piano.|sd
B|Oh, so do I.|sd
A|Oh, you do.|bf
B|well I have one here,|sd
B|it's the one that I grew up with,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my folks gave it to me,|sd
B|and, uh, a couple years ago when they, they sail,|sd
B|and so they sold their home|sd
B|and they, they've been sailing,|sd
B|and, uh, so it's here|sd
B|but I haven't touched one like since college, so I kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again.|sd
B|And of course, my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it|sd
B|and I'd love to teach them to play, too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I'm not great,|sd
B|but I remember it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well I'm not that great either.|sd
A|I used to be a lot better than I am now.|sd
A|I, I have played for, uh, the church choir,|sd
A|and, uh, I played for the choral club in high school|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, but, I, you know, I don't practice a lot anymore,|sd
A|and, uh, you know, you get rusty.|sv
A|You really,|%
B|You do,|aa
B|you do.|aa
A|I never thought I would get rusty,|sd
A|but I'm rusty now.|sd
B|Well, I, I figure it takes practice|sd
B|and I, I don't, I say I don't have the time,|sd
B|that's not true.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|By the time I put my kids in bed at night, I don't want to do anything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, you know, I've worked all day|sd
B|and I come home|sd
B|and I do that,|sd
B|I, and, you know, even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that, I, I think gee, I could do this or that,|sd
B|I have an hour here.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't want to do them sometimes,|sd
B|I'm too tired.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|So, I try to save that for the weekend.|sd
B|I need to get better at it though|sd
A|Well, sewing does take up, take an awful lot of time, takes an awful lot of time.|sv
B|Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.|sd
B|If, if somebody would lay it out for me, then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it.|sd
B|I could do that all day long|sd
B|and I, I can remember once in high school, I wanted some extra money,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and my mom wanted some pants,|sd
B|so she laid out the material|sd
B|and I cut it and sewed it|sd
B|and she paid me I think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I, I hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and, make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|on the, on the, right on the straight grain, and all that stuff,|^2
B|Yes,|aa
B|on the grain of the fabric.|sd
A|uh-huh.|%
B|It drives me crazy|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|that, that's, that's the part that I don't like, too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I like sewing, sewing up the garment itself.|sd
A|I really like to do that,|sd
A|but the, the cutting and the, all the,|sd
A|even the cutting I don't like.|sd
B|Well what are some of the other features on this machine?|qw
B|It sounds wonderful.|sv
A|Well that's about it really.|sd
A|It's, it has four, uh, four threads instead of, the, the regular basic two threads.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|And, uh, it,|%
B|Is that for designs,|qy
B|or is that for the regular seam in the fabric|qrr
B|or,|%
A|No,|nn
A|you, you can either use three or four of the threads.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Uh, it's kind of, it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine, like the, they're loopers under the bottom|sd
A|and then the, there's a seam stitch|sd
A|and it's the loopers that form the, the edge, you know that edge finish.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, that's what really makes it look professional.|sd
A|You can do a lot with the Serger though.|sd
A|You can make, uh, piping and cording|sd
A|and, uh, you can use all kinds of different, uh, textures of thread.|sd
B|So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do.|bf
A|Well, yes,|aa
A|but you, you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine.|sd
A|You can't throw your sewing machine away.|sd
A|you, you need it to do things like button holes, and, uh, seams that need to be really strong, need to be done on the sewing machine.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So the Serger is not a sewing machine, itself.|qy^d
B|It's something that goes with it?|qy^d
A|It's, uh,|%
B|Like an attachment|qy^d
B|or,|%
A|No,|nn
A|it's, it's a, it's a, it's a machine,|sd
A|it's not exactly a sewing machine|sd
A|but it it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff,|sd
A|but there are are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do. Like you can't top stitch with it.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|You know, you can't do top stitching,|sd
A|or, um, there's, there's a few things that you just can't do with it.|sd
A|It will also do a rolled edge, um,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Gee, it's just so versatile,|sd
A|I uh.|%
B|Well I'm going to have to go check it out.|sd
B|That's just something I hadn't heard of|sd
B|but it,|%
