A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Where do you enjoy dining out?|qw
B|Oh, I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|do you have children?|qy
B|Uh, we have four,|na
B|but most of them are gone now|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|so there, there might be,|%
B|but we were taking, you know, uh, four, five and six people out|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that makes a difference, doesn't it.|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|What area of the country do you live in?|qw
B|I'm in Texas.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|I am, too.|sd
A|But,|%
B|And we we lived in Ohio prior to this.|sd
A|I did, too.|sd
A|I'm from the Dayton area.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, but I look for service even at the quickie places type things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and then you're stuck|sv
B|and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave|sv
A|Yes.|b
B|so I really don't like the drive-thrus that much.|sd
B|I, I like to go and eat there.|sd
B|But I would say service, uh, atmosphere, and whether the food is good,|sd
B|and on going out, I like steaks.|sd
B|So, we try to hit those places when we can.|sd
A|When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids,|sd
A|and my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then that way they can get their burgers and fries|sd
A|and we can have a salad bar|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's, because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens,|sd
B|and, in, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|that's right,|aa
B|That's what you find,|sv
B|right,|aa
A|I know.|aa
B|My husband likes, uh, Dairy Queens.|sd
B|He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs, I guess,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so he's a fan of, of Dairy Queen,|sd
B|and, and we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although I'm not that excited about it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place|sd
B|but yet I hate to cook food at home|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|b
B|Or we eat junk food at home|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|uh, now my|%
A|Well, what are some of your, your favorite inexpensive places?|qw
B|Oh, we'll go to them all.|sd
B|We sort of take turns.|sd
B|And we, uh|%
B|I sort of favor the ones,|%
B|if I have a coupon we can go there|sd
B|and if not we can't, because it's cheaper|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so mine is, monetarily, I guess strongly monetarily based.|sd
B|Uh, we'll go get pizza and, uh, at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's.|sd
A|Oh, we are Little Caesar fans here|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that's where we always go,|sd
B|But it's just a lot cheaper than, than Domino's,|sv
B|so that's.|%
B|We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|we like Grandy's, too.|sd
B|McDonald's, uh, we've sort of been off of that for a while|sd
B|and no particular reason,|sd
B|and I,|%
B|maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there|sd
B|and she never wanted us to show up there|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so, I don't, we don't go there that much.|sd
A|Where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out, or a big meal?|qw
B|A nice meal, oh,|^h
A|Where do you go for steaks?|qw
B|It's usually when we're out of town|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so it's really not in town.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|You ever been to Houston's on Belt Line?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|That's where we go to get steaks|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they have a teriyaki steak there,|sd
A|and when we have something to celebrate, we head to Houston's.|sd
A|They don't take reservations,|sd
A|and you wind up waiting about an hour|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but the food is good,|sd
A|and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink, unless you get there at five o'clock,|sd
A|then you can go right through.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks,|sd
A|so, that's our nice place to go.|sd
A|We don't usually take the kids when we go there,|sd
B|But well, we don't go out that much,|sd
B|I well, I guess we do go out without kids.|sd
B|We're usually picking things up quickly,|sd
B|though we just don't dwell on food too much,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places|sd
A|Right,|b
A|That's right.|aa
B|so, it doesn't really matter to him.|sd
B|He'd probably just like to stay home. Well, I think, I, I never have liked to cook food,|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's the way with my husband.|sd
A|He's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends,|sd
A|and I've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere,|sd
A|so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend.|sd
B|but I think it all began eating out when we had, uh, the boys in, in different, uh, baseball on baseball|sd
A|Right.|b
B|it was mainly baseball teams|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and my husband would coach,|sd
B|so we were never home at the same time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'm not one that's going to fix, you know, the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|or you go you know you fend for yourself.|sv
A|Yep.|aa
B|You go somewhere else.|sv
