B|Really?|bh
B|Yeah,|b
B|we like it, too.|sd
B|Have you seen the movie?|qy
A|Uh, I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it,|ng
A|and they're, you know, already out with number six by now,|sd
A|but. So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet,|sd
A|but I.|%
B|Oh, you haven't seen any of them.|qy^d
A|No.|nn
B|Oh, well, they're good,|sv
B|they're real good.|sv
B|They're, uh, they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies, though.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Which ones are you watching, the new ones?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I've seen quite a few of the older ones.|sd
A|I haven't seen really the new generation that much.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Yeah.|b
A|Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the the newer one?|qy
B|Well, they're, they're a lot different.|sd
B|But, I like, I like the older ones because at that time, you know, they were really futuristic, you know.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real futuristic, too,|sd
B|but I like, I like both of them.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I do too.|sd
A|I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot,|sd
A|I mean, he almost hates the new ones|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something,|sd
A|but,  I don't|sd
B|No.|aa
B|Not really.|sv
B|It's not really like   a soap  opera,|sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|but, but it's,|%
B|but that's true,|sv
B|I mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff,|sd
B|but that's the way all shows are now.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|sure.|b
A|Well, let's see.|^h
A|Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's sort of how Matlock is,|sd
A|but COLOMBO is way tricky|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean  he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them.|sd
B|Well, it seems like they always  show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college,|sd
A|Well, did you see the one.|qy
A|Um.|%
B|or is this, is there a series on.|qrr

B|Yeah,|b
B|I wondered if that's|%
A|Huh.|%
B|see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what,|sd
B|but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,|sd
B|and then, then they keep showing them over and over.|sd
A|Oh, I guess I've, I haven't  seen it before.|sd
B|He was a movie  director,|sd
B|and he had that gal killed.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|Okay.|b
A|yeah,|b
A|on the set or something.|sd
B|That was pretty good though|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it was.|sv
A|But, yeah,|%
A|I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though|sv
B|No kidding.|ba
A|I don't think so.|sv

A|Oh.|b
B|You never saw that?|qy^d
A|I've heard of it a lot,|ng
A|I've heard of,|sd
A|a lot of people somehow or something|%

B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|that was a different soap opera.|sd
