A|the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day.|sd
A|I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, it was very different before.|sd
A|How do you dress?|qo
B|Well, I'm a drafter,|^h
B|so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes|sd
B|and I have sweatshirt on today.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I understand.|b
B|They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress|sd

B|No,|nn
B|huh-uh.|nn
A|So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in,|sd
B|but that's for my husband's job and not mine|sd

B|but So,|%
A|Oh. Well, that's interesting.|ba
A|Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh,|^h

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|middle of the road.|sv
