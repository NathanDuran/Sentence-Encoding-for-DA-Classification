A|Uh, did you watch the Bulls this morning?|qy
B|You know what,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I watched a little bit of, uh, of the Bulls game|sd
B|and I, uh, had to leave.|sd
B|Uh, in fact I, I think the Bulls were ahead when I, uh, when I left.|sd
B|Who won the game?|qw
A|They won in a squeaker.|sd
A|They won by they won by two points.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Uh, they were behind as they headed into each quarter|sd
A|and then they came back in the second half|sd
A|and at the end, I think they were, uh, looked, they looked like they were closing it out|sd
A|and then Detroit kept coming back|sd
A|and uh, Isaiah missed a three point attempt, at the end|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I think the Bulls won by two.|sd
A|I think they do, as a matter of fact.|na
B|Yeah.|b
A|One of the, uh, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would, uh, if they continued at their current pace, uh, set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|they looked real good|sd
A|and,|%
B|They, they do,|aa
B|and they, you know,|%
B|I think by, uh, by relieving some of the pressure off of, uh, of, uh, uh,|sv
B|Michael Jordan really helped them out.|sv
B|You know, he doesn't have, they don't have to rely on him to score you know, thirty or forty points  at every  at every game|sv
A|Right.|b
B|so,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, they, they're, they're balancing their attack|sv
B|Oh, I know,|aa
B|I'm,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|I saw the I saw the Warriors, uh, just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors, uh, Dallas game.|sd
A|I saw the, the second half of the game last night|sd
A|and they were impressive.|sd
B|They look good.|sv
A|Billy Owens looks like he was,|sd
A|that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|now, I don't, uh, I haven't kept up with what was going on with, uh, with the,|sd
A|Well, they traded away, uh, Mitch Richmond,|sd
A|or is it Tim Hardaway.|t1
A|One of the two, uh, who, along with, uh, Chris Mullen was, you know,|sd
A|though three were three of the best in the N B A,|sv
A|and and, they made a heck of a threesome|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|Good move.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|oh, yeah,|aa
A|he's really worked out well.|sv
A|They've got the Warriors have got a team, uh,|sv
A|and, uh, I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do.|sv
A|They're ahead,|sd
A|and the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth, uh, position in the west|sd
A|and I don't know,|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|in the east, I don't know, uh,|sd
A|is it Boston in, uh, first place?|qy
B|Uh, I think Boston's in first.|na
B|Uh, I, you know, I haven't kept up with any of the other, uh, teams.|sd
B|I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks, you know.|sd
A|Boy,|ba
A|they've had a hard time.|sv
A|They said  they've lost a lot of  squeakers.|sd
B|Oh, man!|ba
B|That,|%
B|well, yeah,|b
B|but, I mean, just this whole year has been just disastrous for them|sv
B|and, uh, you know, they're going, I, I think they're going for an all time record of how many you know, losses in a row they can, they they can, uh, pull out.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's unbelievable.|sv
A|How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.|qw
A|Do you, for example, like San  Antonio  in Dallas?|qy
B|Uh,|%
B|Well, actually, actually, the, the, the Dallas area here, uh, pulls for Dallas.|sd
B|Uh, San Antonio pulls for San Antonio,|sd
B|and Houston pulls for, for the Rockets.|sd
A|So there isn't much crossover, huh,|bf
B|There really,|%
B|I mean, not a whole lot. You know,|sd
B|I mean, you find them, they're, find them be, to be pretty loyal, uh, in, with the local teams.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, you know, it's kind of, I guess it's kind of like, uh, there in the Bay area, you know, you don't find a whole lot of, uh, of Sacramento fans.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's true,|aa
A|because San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they?|qy
B|Really isn't,|ng
B|uh-uh.|nn
A|No.|aa
B|It's, you know, it's, it's about the same, uh, same distance from here to to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento.|sd
A|Is it?|bh
A|Yeah,|b
A|so it's not something you'd drive,|bf
B|So it's, yeah, it's not really a local, you know,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing.|sd
B|Uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio|sd
B|and they, I mean, they have got a great club. You know.|sd
A|They've done a good job.|sv
A|I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him certainly,|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah|aa
B|that always makes a big difference.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I mean, that's|%
B|So,|%
A|I think the way it, uh, I think that's the way it works now in basketball.|sv
A|You, you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and, you know, uh, Bird for the, for the, uh, Celtics|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,|%
B|And, you know, uh, you know, I used to think that, that one, one player really doesn't make a club,|sd
B|but it really does, you know.|sv
A|Well, it ,|%
B|You get somebody like Magic|sv
B|and you can see the decline in that team.|sv
A|Well, yeah.|b
B|Once he left, you know, it's, it's just not the same, uh, it's not the same team.|sv
B|There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for.|sv
A|Well, I think you're right|aa
A|and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit|sv
A|and I think those things do make a difference|sv
A|and there are marquee players.|sv
A|And  I think  I think Jordan and the, and the Bulls have to be, uh, considered the likely favorites.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I don't know who would meet them in the west.|sd
A|Uh, I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year.|sd
A|They were so|sv
B|Who won that Portland game?|qw
A|You know, I wasn't, I, I I watched only a few minutes of it|sd
A|and I wasn't paying attention.|sd
A|Uh, and so I don't know, uh,|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|But Phoenix, you know, Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs|sv
A|and,|%
