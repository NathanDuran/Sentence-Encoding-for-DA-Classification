A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, generally I get, uh, you know, most of my news, uh, in the, you know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, and, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. With, with occasional smatterings of, of, uh, you know, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, my, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to, to look at the articles every day and, and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the details.|sd
A|So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.|sd
B|Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like?|qy
A|Well, yes.|ny
A|I, I, well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and so I, I, I like the weekly magazines, uh, because it gives me, you know, the high points of what's going on.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, but many times, uh, you know, the, the local, uh, the local news kind of suffers, you know.|sv
A|But here I am, you know, cheek by jowl with our nation's capital|sd
A|and,|%
B|Oh,  that's right.|ba
B|You're very close actually.|sd
B|It's  almost a, uh, bedroom community  for  the capital.|bf
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes.|aa
A|exactly.|aa
A|Well, when, when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the beltway|sd
A|But, uh, it turns out that, uh, that, that the C N N is, I think, is great. And for, for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but generally, they're, they're, they're more sound bitish, you know, kind of thing|sv
A|and, and I don't really, uh, you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, uh, you know, dose of news that way.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|A lot of my information comes from several sources.|sd
B|Probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio. Uh, which I like.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|Uh, I, I think it's fairly objective|sv
B|and I always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative.|sd
B|And while there's an inherent, uh, filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read, uh, I always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of, uh, favoring the other side.|sv
B|That's, that's potential indication of balance.|sv
B|And, generally, I really do believe they are pretty balanced.|sv
B|Uh, I also read TIME magazine|sd
B|and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the, uh, various, uh, of the articles and the front section|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Well the MERCURY and the, and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really,  can  stand up there.|sv
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh, you|%
B|did you use to live around here?|qy
A|Uh, Redwood City.|na
A|I use to work at Anteks.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Oh, yeah,|bk
B|okay.|bk
B|I know exactly where that is.|sd
A|Anteks, Amdahl  and places like that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|we, we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at times, at, well the LOS ANGELES TIMES. Which I've found to be a, uh a very good quality uh, newspaper|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I like a lot of the articles there.|sd
B|the other thing when you said, we don't have cable T V, so but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is, is called C SPAN.|sd
A|Yes.|aa
A|I, I've, I enjoy,|sd
A|see they have, uh, we have two, the, both C SPANS here.|sd
A|But,  but  really, the, on the public T V, you know, MACNEIL LEHRER is one, is an hour's program that I always,|sd
B|Both?|br
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|if, if I watch any news program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. And, and occasionally C SPAN.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I like a, I saw the, uh, the, uh, the, the tapes that were, that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust|sd
A|was, the whole thing was, was run on that|sd
A|and   and, and also,  they have the, uh, the, uh, uh, PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD.|sd
B|Oh, I  never say that. *listen: should "say" be "saw"?|sd
B|That would  have been interesting.|sv
A|It,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, I think that's always fascinating.|sv
B|I wish, I wish we had something.|sd
A|when, when it first,  uh, you know, when it first tuned in on that I, you know,|sd
A|it's one that's,|%
A|I think it was, somebody was just scarcely just, just ripping the hell out of  another person.|sd
A|And I,|%
A|and everybody was, you know, making noise in the background.|sd
B|But it's usually the Prime Minister,|sv
B|right?|^g
A|Here's this  dude in a wig|sd
B|Thatcher,|sd
B|Major .|sd
A|and I said to myself, it's another Monty Python that  I didn't know about|sd
A|And then, and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench|sd
A|and I said oh, it's Parliament|sd
B|Which could be another of Monty Python.|sv
A|Yeah.|ny
A|So I, I thought to myself, I can't wait.|sd
A|I'm going over to, to Britain in mid, you know, in mid-May.|sd
A|I, I, I'm going to, uh, you know, you know, approach my, uh, you know,|%
A|this is how I discovered, you know, the the Prime Minister's, you know, question and answer period, you know.|sd
B|I, I have seen that|sd
B|and, uh, a, aside from the level of wit which is much higher than, generally, in American politics, uh, which I really enjoy. I really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I think.|sv
B|And it's unlike the fairly controlled, uh, press conferences that Presidents of the United States have here where they, they always seem,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
