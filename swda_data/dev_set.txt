A|I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.|sv
B|Definitely.|aa
A|Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that.|sv
A|I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Have you ever served on a jury before?|qy
B|Uh, I have twice.|na
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|It was a pretty wild experience.|sv
A|Uh, what sorts of cases were they?|qw
B|They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know.|sd
A|So were they criminal or civil?|qy
B|They were civil.|sd
B|They weren't  they weren't any criminal.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|What, uh, what was the verdict?|qw
A|Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?|qy
B|Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so it was,|%
B|they,|%
B|and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.|sd
A|So did it become?|qy
B|So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then he changed his mind after they turned it in|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|but it then became unanimous.|sd
A|Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?|qy
A|You just needed a majority?|qy^d
B|Right.|aa
A|What was, what was the other case?|qw
A|That was also civil?|qy^d
B|The, the other case was just traffic,|sd
B|the,|%
B|and, you know, it was seat belt law|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it, it didn't even hardly go through,|sd
A|Oh, didn't really even count.|^2
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm a college student|sd
A|so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point,|sd
A|but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.|sv
A|Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,|sd
A|but, I, I haven't.|sd
A|Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,|sv
A|but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.|sv
A|Especially sort of.|%
B|I wouldn't think  that it does I mean, from, from my, from what I experienced in them,|sv
A|How,|%
B|it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.|sd
A|Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|but it was, you know, it was,|%
B|jury was unorganized|sv
B|and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm not used to it not being organized,|sd
B|and I just assumed that it would have been.|sd
A|Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo|bf
A|and the jurors just sort of,|bf
A|someone had to figure out what was going on?|qy^d
B|That's about what it was.|aa
A|Um. That's interesting.|sv
A|Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?|qy
A|I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial|qy
A|or,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|they, well they picked one person,|sd
B|and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.|sd
A|So it it did end up working out pretty well?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it ended up working all right.|sd
A|The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,|sd
A|and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,|sd
A|it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,|sv
A|and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.|sv
B|I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on.|sv
A|In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer that, which was, uh, seemingly their property.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|It was on his property.|sd
A|Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,|bf
A|and he hadn't made the payments.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|So they came to get it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property|sd
B|and he wouldn't let them take it off.|sd
A|Uh, so they were suing to get it back.|bf
B|So, and they are, it was a double wide,|sd
B|so they'd already taken it apart.|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|So they left it there|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|So they were suing him for the money,|sd
B|and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you,|ad
B|Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I do.|sd
B|Do you?|bh
B|I have a grandmother.|sd
B|She's a hundred and two.|sd
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|She'll be a hundred and three in August.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.|sd
B|She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town|sd
B|and then my sister takes care of her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|She still has her snap.|sd
B|She takes care of her own business.|sd
B|This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker,|sd
B|but with somebody that needs around the clock care,|sd
B|I have seen my family age.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I have seen them in the,|sd
B|she's been there ten years now.|sd
B|And I have seen them age twenty in the time and, and with the expense and everything,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I I still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home|sv
B|and they needed some quality care,|sd
B|I would put someone in a nursing home.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|My mother-in-law finally.|sd
A|They had to make a family decision.|sd
A|There's seven children in my husband's family|sd
A|and fortunately four of them live in the same home town|sd
A|and she has Alzheimer's.|sd
A|It was getting where she was getting dangerous. I mean letting strangers in and things like this,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they were very fortunate.|sv
A|It's a small town|sd
A|and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers|sd
A|and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time|sd
B|Oh, well that's good.|ba
A|but she really doesn't.|sd
A|Nobody thought she would adjust,|sd
A|but she has adjusted beautifully.|sd
B|Oh, that is great.|ba
A|But then I am also facing my father who is very sick|sd
A|and my mother and father reside in Colorado.|sd
A|She's been taking care of him.|sd
A|I don't know how much longer this can last|sd
A|and at that point because he requires round the clock.|sd
A|He can't do anything without her.|sd
A|He doesn't know when to take his medicine|sd
A|and it's really sad|sv
A|and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh,|sd
A|my brothers are not interested in helping me|sd
A|so I would have to move him down here.|sd
A|That way,|%
A|I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one.|sd
A|You know, where I can go see it.|sd
A|I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.|sd
A|And,|%
B|Oh, why  yeah.|b
B|I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh,|sd
A|like they have apartment styles,|sd
A|but that wouldn't work for him.|sd
A|I think he is beyond that.|sv
A|Where if you need help you can get it,|sd
A|but basically people kind of have a small apartment|sd
A|and doctors are available if they need them.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I  know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin.|sd
A|And allows,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.|sv
A|Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is|sv
A|but,|%
B|And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|It, it takes every penny.|sv
B|They want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And that's the sad part about it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|and I think a lot of people who do it now.|sv
A|In Colorado it's interesting.|sv
A|I talked to my mother.|sd
A|They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.|sd
A|And my mother could make it on that.|sd
A|What she probably would do is disburse the money to me|sd
A|and then I would send it back to her|sd
A|so that's what would happen.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think that's what most people do.|sv
B|You just have to give it, everything away.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It's  unfortunate.|sv
B|I, I  work at a brokerage firm|sd
B|and I have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's frightening.|sv
A|And I guess, uh, I don't know how old you are.|sd
A|I'm forty-six.|sd
A|You know, we're the generation moving into this|sd
A|and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. You know.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|And everybody in my family has always had,|sd
B|we don't have any children.|sd
B|Everybody that has, has them later in life.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties.|sd
B|So, I mean, they're not that far away.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise|sv
A|and he's still living at home|sd
A|and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.|sd
B|Oh, I know.|b
A|And so, it's kind of,|%
A|you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,|sv
A|but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older.|sv
A|Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.|sd
A|But  you see these people in their seventies|sd
B|It,|%
B|but yeah.|b
B|Most people aren't.|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|most aren't.|sv
A|That's the problem.|sv
B|And that's the bad thing.|sv
B|I would hate to have lived so long.|sd
B|She lived by herself.|sd
B|My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one. And just did everything,|sd

A|No,|aa

A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|they started that about a year ago,|sd
B|and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,|sd

B|Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|so that's, you know,|%
A|I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,|sd

A|well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,|sd
A|but still, it can be dangerous.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|well, I, I, I agree.|aa
B|I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know,|%

B|as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,|sd
B|as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.|sd
A|Now do they fire them, or do they?|qy
B|Well, see, this is it,|^h
B|this is where I start having my problems with my company.|sd
B|I work for a private company,|sd
B|and and the policy is something like, see if I can state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.|sv
A|Huh, that's.|%
A|I think our policy is that,|sv
A|all right, it's probably the same thing.|sv
A|I'm not really sure what the|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|really,|b
B|it's one of those things that you read once,|sv
B|and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,|sd
A|but I'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|our company's a little tougher on the second chance.|sd
B|I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.|sd
A|Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,|qy
B|Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment|no
B|and, you know, it's not,|%
B|I guess I haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, so I you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,|sv
B|I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A and B are going to be in|sv
B|and next week, C and D are going to come in|sd
A|You could time it just right.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|I know one employee,|sd
A|I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,|sd
A|and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.|sd
A|That'd be just as dangerous.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.|sv
A|Huh. That's true.|aa
B|You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do they give any limits on alcohol,|qy

A|Yeah.|b
A|I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association|sv
B|Um.|%
A|so there is a progressive path,|sd
A|but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh, like  really,|sv
B|Um.|%
B|Are they  like pretty much train for a specific job|qy
B|and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|somewhat that,|sv
A|but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,|sd
A|uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.|sv
A|But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,|sv
B|Well, you know that's interesting though.|sv
B|Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.|sv
B|I use to think that, you know, after you work,|sd
B|you mean security, job security?|qy
A|Job security,|sd
A|yes.|ny
B|Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,|sv
B|but I don't know if it is so much anymore.|h
B|In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, it wasn't necessarily,|%
B|I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we are seeing that here as well.|sd
A|Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|No  doubt|aa
A|But,|%
B|yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,|sv
A|it's where it's most expedient which, Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means  it's  often the lowest support type roles.|sv
B|Expedient,|b^m
B|yeah|aa
B|that's exactly it.|aa
B|Yeah,|%
B|where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.|bf
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh.|b
B|See, yeah.|b
A|So we,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think that's one of the things too.|sv
B|You get too many management people, you know.|sv
A|It's very easy.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.|sd
B|Well, those people aren't there anymore.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|Because it's support people that are  providing  the speed for it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|but,|%
B|so what else do you think is important?|qo
A|Well the, uh,|%
A|that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|because my perspective is from an institution,|sd
A|uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess innovation,|sv
A|although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly|sv
A|and so you can see the reward of the efforts.|sv
B|I think probably in a small,|sv
B|yeah,|aa
B|I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.|sv
B|You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|You end up being your own person|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem|sv
A|and you  know you really,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|whereas  yeah in a smaller,|sv
B|I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Hello, Lynn.|fp
B|Yes.|b
A|Okay.|b
A|Do you have any pets?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I have a dog and cat now.|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|that's, that's what ours are too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep.|sd

A|Oh, really.|bh
A|Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. Um.|sv
B|Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?|qy
A|Sure,|na

B|I've had a skunk|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I've had a Burmese python,|sd
B|I've had rats,|sd
B|I've had mice|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|uh, let's see,|^h
B|I've had gerbils,|sd
B|I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?|qy
B|Yes|ny
A|Yeah.|b
B|it was litter trained|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and we had it perfumed|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it was very aggressive.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|and the skunk.|b^m
B|And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Um.|%
B|Nobody came near it when he was there.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh, I had, I had a dog one time,|sd
A|and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them,|sd
B|but the glands had been removed|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so,|%
A|Right,|b
A|but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|why, I don't know,|sd
A|I, I think they're kind of nice to have,|sv
A|they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to,|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like,|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|something giving you some affection as well.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I always said if I Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog|sd
A|What, what do you think?|qo
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|That'd be the best way to be.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs?|qy
B|Well we had a German Shepherd|sd
B|and he had dysplasia|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.|sd
A|Really.|b
B|So, when he died, we got a little one.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old,|sd
B|and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
A|almost cruel for him to, to walk.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|he just, he couldn't get up,|sd
B|he couldn't walk,|sd
B|so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds,|sd
B|so it was a chore.|sd
A|Wow, yeah.|ba
B|So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then we've had three cats in our married life,|sd
B|and we've got a calico now.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we've got a calico cat too.|sd
B|Do you?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|she's the, she's the nice one.|sd
A|We, uh, we used to live in an apartment|sd
A|and like, our cats never went outside,|sd
A|but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out,|sd
A|and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy,|sd
A|and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in|sd
B|Um.|%
A|so, we had to, we had to flea bath them|sd
A|and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, don't even talk to me,|ba
B|I, when I was single I had gone away for the weekend,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat,|sd
B|and he let her out,|sd
B|and my house was loaded with fleas,|sd
B|I mean, you walked in|sd
B|and your legs were just black.|sd
A|Really.|bh
B|And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.|sd
A|Really.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I found it, you know, in the street.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I was a social worker at the time, and found it,|sd
B|Now is it Stacy?|qy
A|Angie.|sd
B|Angie,|b^m
B|I'm sorry.|fa
A|Okay.|bd
B|Well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?|qw
A|Um, let's see,|^h
A|uh, I like seafood.|sd
A|Uh, let's see,|^h
A|uh, shrimp, steamed uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.|sd
A|Uh, spicy lobster with linguini.|sd
B|That sounds good.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?|br
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|And what would that be like, a clam or, uh,|qy
A|Right.|na
B|Okay.|bk
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too.|sv
A|Uh, and that way, you can have a variety. Uh,|sd
B|So if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?|qw
A|Uh,|%
B|Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or,|qrr
A|Yeah,|b
A|fresh vegetables would be good|sv
A|or, uh, just,|%
B|Probably not nachos and dip, huh?|qy
A|No.|nn
B|And would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|Okay.|bk
B|And then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?|qw
A|Oh, all these hard questions|^h
A|Uh, what, white wine?|qy
B|That would be my guess.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, And then, uh, uh, dessert.|sd
A|I'm not really a drinker,|sd
A|so I'm not, I don't know a lot about that.|sd
B|Something sweet?|qy^d
A|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|Uh, chocolate, something chocolate.|sd
A|Uh|%
B|You must like chocolate.|qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
B|Well, let's see.|^h
B|Usually when we have a dinner party, I always, I like to grill.|sd
A|Oh, you do?|qy^d
B|So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.|sd
B|One of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think, is that what comes in  those little blocks?  And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese|sd
B|and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail.|sv
B|And then I like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops.|sd
B|And then we have, uh, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then, uh, I don't know what we usually have for dessert.|sd
B|Cake sometimes,|sd
B|but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, I guess.|sd
A|That sounds good, too.|sv
B|But that's, I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come over.|sv
A|Traditional|sd
A|right?|^g
B|Traditional,|sd
B|yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
B|I wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind.|sv
A|I just started, I just really started, uh, uh, learning about that|sd
A|and I bought a Martha Stewart,|sd
A|I don't know if you've heard of her.|qy^d
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|Her cookbook|sd
A|and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods.|sd
B|Oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?|qy
A|Um, my father owns a restaurant.|sd
B|Oh, in, uh, Is it in Dallas?|qy
A|It's, it's just a, uh, a cafe,|sd
A|so it's not really anything, you know, that I want to,|sd
A|it's not the same|sd
A|Uh, it's in Lewisville.|sd
B|Okay,|bk
B|all right.|bk
B|So you graduated from which high school?|qw
A|Trinity.|sd
B|Trinity,|b^m
B|okay.|bk
B|And that's a public school or private?|qy
A|That's public.|sd
B|Huh, okay,|bk
B|I have to get to know this area a little better, I guess.|sd
B|Uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|uh-huh, *listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?|nn
A|it's not.|sd
B|Um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.|qy^d
A|Uh.|%
B|Well, let's see,|^h
B|what else for catering. Uh,|^h
A|Let's see,|t1
A|what about Hawaiian luau.|qw
B|Oh, that would be good.|sv
A|Could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,|sd
A|let's see, uh,|^h
B|And you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to.|sv
A|I think, I think decorating your food is, you know, really,|sv
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|um, I guess we're going to talk, describe, uh, job benefits,|sd
A|and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits?|qw
B|Uh, I would say the medical, uh, group insurance area as far as, uh, covering medical costs for yourself or family members.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, um, does your company have good benefits in that, in that regard?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I think,|%
B|I work for a public school system, district|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,|sd
B|where the school district does, um, the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of, uh, costs.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|But overall, um, I've been pleased with it over the years.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to alter, uh, you know, change companies,|sv
B|or now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I see.|b
B|How about yourself?|qo
A|Uh, well I'm,|%
A|my medical coverage is with an H M O|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, so, that's, in my opinion, that's that's bordering on a health clinic,|sv
A|but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Um.|%
B|Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year, or calendar years,|sd
B|and I was in the H M O,|sd
B|and, um, I was because my, my same doctor, you know, agreed to be in it for, uh,|sd
B|they usually sign a contract or something|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, uh, I did have surgery last summer|sd
B|and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day,|sd
B|and I've never seen another bill,|sd
B|so I I have to say it really works.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it.|sd
B|Uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, you know, ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for you know, those people.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|That's right,|aa
A|yeah,|%
A|I'm, I'm fairly young myself,|sd
A|I've only been,|sd
A|when I first started working which,|sd
A|three years ago is when I first got into full time employment|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, at that time I immediately joined the H M O,|sd
A|and I never really,|%
A|so the only doctor I, I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O,|sd
A|and, uh you know, for me it's worked out real good.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|b
B|but if you, you know, have a family and, and, um, everybody's gone to different doctors, uh, it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your, just has, you know, all the medical history|sv
B|and you feel comfortable with it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I'm sure it would be very stressful|sv
B|and, my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay.|sd
B|You can continue to go to your own doctor|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but your benefits are not as, you know, good,|sd
B|so, uh.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|%
A|um, like you, you mentioned you work for a school system.|sd
A|I work for, uh, Georgia Tech  in the  research branch,|sd
B|Oh, all right.|b
A|and I guess another one that, that I rank up there high is the, uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, um, I enjoy as a benefit.|sv
B|I do too.|aa
B|Are you talking about like Spring Break|qy
B|and,|%
A|Right|na
B|Right.|b^m
A|yeah,|b
A|getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|It, it really, um,|%
B|I don't think most of our teachers,|sv
B|now I'm not a teacher,|h
B|I am a secretarial executive assistant,|sd
B|but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all, all year long frankly.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It is just, Texas has really, um, you know,|sv
B|they want everybody educated, no matter what it costs,|sd
B|uh, and it, it would be just,|%
B|we all look forward to,|sv
B|like in two weeks we have Spring Break,|sd
B|and I don't know who looks forward to it more, the students or the teachers and the staff.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|What do you do there?|qw
A|Well, um, I'm not actually on the teaching faculty,|sd
A|but we have a large research organization associated with the university,|sd
A|and that's who I work with.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|Um, and we're given, you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do.|sd
A|We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|I would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|and, um, it's good that they allow you that.|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|It, um,|%
B|as I say, the schools,|sd
B|now we do have to work, you know, the day,|sd
B|but we do get many days off,|sd
B|and, uh, we all look forward to it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college|sd
B|but at the  time, I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I've just continued to, uh, stay there|sd
A|Are there,  are there any things that, that you'd like to see changed in terms of the, the benefits?|qy
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I guess it took,|sv
A|so I guess the recording has started now.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|So, have you ever served on a jury?|qy
A|I served,|sd
A|I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury.|sd
A|A lot of the same rules apply.|sd
A|Have you ever served on one?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I finally served on one last year.|sd
B|I've, um, been voting for years,|sd
B|and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I finally was.|sd
B|So it was an interesting experience.|sv
B|I was kind of boring. *listen; should I be "it"|sv
A|Was it civil or criminal?|qy
B|Uh, it was, uh uh, it was, uh, well, let's see, it was municipal court|sd
A|A grand jury or,|qrr
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so it was a combination of, uh,|sd
B|and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks|sd
A|I see.|b
B|so it was a combination of criminal and civil,|sd
B|and they had, uh,|sd
B|well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, uh, just sit in the jury room.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, did, did the judge, uh, hand down sentences|qy
A|or did you folks do that?|qrr
B|Uh, yeah,|ny
B|the judge did.|sd
B|Uh, I, uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury.|sd
B|I kept getting, uh,|sd
B|I'd be questioned, uh, for empaneling the jury,|sd
B|and they kept, uh, dismissing me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|%
B|Course they don't have to give a reason,|sd
B|but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like, you know,|sd
A|No.|aa
B|they want to get the best, uh, mix for their case,|sv
B|so they ask all kinds of wild questions.|sv
A|That that's a science in itself.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,|sd
B|and I think part of it was they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more.|sv
B|So.|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|I see.|b
A|Because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical|bf
A|and|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that was probably it,|sv
B|although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught,|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, uh, were, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,|qy
A|or would,|qrr
A|if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.|qy
B|Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing.|^h
B|Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day,|sd
B|and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case,|sd
B|and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty,|sd
B|and he would never vote for guilty.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|So, uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman|sd
B|and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,|sv
B|so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So the whole thing had to be tried over again.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|I bet that made him happy.|sv

B|The, uh,|%

A|Right.|b
B|I, uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,|sd
B|and the other people were kind of mixed|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.|sd
B|Cost him a lot of money,|sv
B|I'm sure.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, how many members were on the jury?|qw
A|Was it a six or twelve member jury?|qy
B|Uh, it must have been six.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's kind of curious to me.|sd
A|I didn't realize until the, uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries.|sd
A|I thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|But, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.|sv
B|Um.|%
A|I know on a|sd
A|getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.|sd
A|It's a simple majority, you know, rules.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, let's  see,|h
B|is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous|qy

A|we weren't, we, we,|%
A|the two that I were on had to do with drugs|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,|sd
A|the government really failed to prove its case,|sd
A|and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,|sd
A|and we had to acquit him in both cases.|sd
B|Uh, it was too circumstantial?|qy^d
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|I usually go do aerobics and read,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|I understood that.|sd

B|You know, hobbies,|%

B|It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.|sd
B|You know, we like to go out  go  out,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|family.|%
A|Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|But as far as,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've just never been very skilled at,  far, you  know, needle, work|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good|sd
A|and,|%
B|I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.|sd
B|I've done mostly cross stitching.|sd
B|I used to, uh, do like, um,|sd
B|one that I did for both kids are like, oh,|sd
B|they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals|sd
B|and then you have their birth date on them,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then you have a little picture of them|sd
B|and you frame them and stuff,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but nothing steady.|sd
B|Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,|sd
B|but, you know, it's nothing that I, can really,|sd
A|It's not, like you sit and knit every night|bf
B|No.|aa
B|Not at all.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|I don't even know how to knit|sd
A|and my mother used to knit, you know,  all  the time|sd

A|and, and I don't even know how to knit|sd
A|I'm like, that's a lost art from this family|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, um,|%
A|but, it's not a very good topic|sv
A|it feels like,  if,  you know,|h
B|No.|aa
A|not when you're|%
A|neither one of us are really,|sd
A|I, I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Needlepoint, cushions and things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already  made|sv
B|I don't know what, what, is,|sd
B|it's like there,|sd
B|but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff|sd
B|and there's just tons of stuff everywhere|sd
B|and,  you  know, people just do it in their garage|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then on weekends they go out and sell it|sd
B|and during the week they go back and do some more.|sd
A|And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,  you know,  for us it,|bf
B|Right|aa
A|and they make it cheaper for us to buy|sd
B|Yeah|aa
B|Definitely.|aa
A|So,|%
A|but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that|sv
A|because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.|sd
A|It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,|sv
A|you felt very creative.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, it just was so time, time,  involved,  you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
A|and,|%
B|Okay|b
B|Well, I think, I think we're okay.|sv
B|I think we did five minutes,|sv

B|Well, uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, uh, very specific in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing.|sv
A|Well.|arp_nd
B|Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many,|sv
B|I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us.|sv
B|I really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,|sv
B|and I, personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|uh, I guess I basically agree that, uh,|sv
A|do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs?|qy
A|I mean suppose  they found out some other way?|qy^d
B|Well, I think, I think  we, I think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|There's too many cases where it can, you know,|sv
B|there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing.|sv
B|I don't think there's any definitive, you know,|sv
B|okay this person is taking drugs,|^q
B|so we don't want him here.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,|sv
B|I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, I, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that, that it's such a, a big deal.|sv
B|I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you|sd
B|or, you know, it,|%
B|I just, I think it's a whole trust issue.|sv
B|I just can't see it.|sv
A|But, have you ever been in a situation where you, you were drug tested|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, yeah,|ny
B|I have been.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I.  I mean, I was very offended by, by the whole process.|sd
A|I  once too,|sd
A|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean it's very humiliating,|sv
B|and, I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,|sd
B|but I, uh, I am totally against that sort of a, uh,|sv
B|I mean it's, it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I had it during a job interview,|sd
A|and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to, to want to work for them to do this,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and I'm just like, well, uh, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
B|That's, that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know,|sd
B|I did, I, I was in the same sort of situation as,|sd
B|it was a job interview|sd
B|and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested,|sd
B|and it's,|%
B|I just,|%
B|and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know,|sd
B|I really.|%
B|The other side of it is, is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, as in my, it's my bodily fluid|sv
B|and I don't really want you to look at it, or or something pretty basic like that,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work.|sv
B|I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say this is, these behaviors are acceptable and these are not,|sv
B|but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really what people ought to be doing, I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons.|sv
B|That's exactly right.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|And also I just think it, it gets a lot,|sv
B|I'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,|sd
B|and I think that it just moves down along a line that, that I really would find bad if, if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,|sv
B|there's already talk of people,|sd
B|well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke.|^q
B|Well, you know, I, I can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke,|sd
B|but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all.|sv
A|Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or, or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|And other than that I think, I do not think it should be allowable.|sv
B|I think it should be illegal for them to, to want to do that.|sv
B|It should, it's kind of the big brother syndrome,|sv
B|I mean, I just,|%
B|anything like that just kind of scares me.|sd
A|I tend to, to view it,|sd
A|even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an uh, in addition to an individual's rights,|sv
A|but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, and I don't really,|%
B|Okay, Mary.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yes.|b
B|Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,|sd
B|and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually.|sd
B|Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible.|sd
A|Oh, how awful|ba
B|It was true, it was truly awful.|sv
B|It was not one that I picked,|sd
B|but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I|sd
B|because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people|sd
B|and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that.|sd
B|And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures.|sd
A|I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, they keep it rather secretive,|sv
A|yes|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,|sd
A|well two, two of them actually.|sd
A|Uh, the RAIN MAN was one.|sd
B|Oh that was great one.|sv
A|Wasn't that fabulous,|aa
A|and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY.|sd
B|Oh, I loved it.|sd
B|You know, I haven't seen that one yet,|sd
B|and I need to go see it.|sv
A|Oh, you need to see that.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and this all took place in the South.|sd
B|Oh my.|ba
A|And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.|sv
B|You bet, especially in the South.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.|sv
A|The acting was phenomenal.|sv
B|Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it.|qy
A|Oh yes,|ny
A|Jessica Tandy won best actress|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|that's right.|sd
B|It, it might have one best picture, too.|sv
A|Yes|aa
A|it did,|sd
A|yes|aa
A|it did.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise.|sd
B|That was,|%
B|yeah,|b
B|I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,|sv
B|but, uh.|%
A|Yes,|aa
A|uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff.|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Is, is the Kmart there?|qy
A|Oh, we do have Kmart here,|na
A|you better believe it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?|qy
B|That was, that was so funny,|sv
B|he had to,|sd
B|or was it Kmart.|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|right|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|That was hilarious.|sv
B|The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,|sd
A|Oh yes.|b
B|and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|yes.|b
B|Unbelievable.|sv
A|Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and everyone feels they are totally retarded.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,|sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|but, boy there's a lots going on in there|sv
A|It's amazing|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,|sv
B|and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example.|sv
A|Yes|aa
A|and the,|%
A|Right,|b
A|well the warmth that developed between them|sd
A|and again it, I think was a picture of relationships.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie|sd
B|I saw it three times.|sd
A|Did you.|bh
B|I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background.|sd
B|I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older|sd
B|and, uh, he's not, you know,|sd
B|nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him|sd
B|but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth|sd
B|so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers.|sd
B|That was neat.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well that's tremendous,|ba
A|that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|a lot.|sd
A|And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|No question,|aa
B|he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that.|sd
B|He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it|sd
B|but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN.|sd
B|I mean he certainly didn't,|sd
B|he only saw it one time,|sd
B|and he didn't go back for more,|sd
B|but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it|sd
B|and, and,|%
A|Well he at least saw it one time|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|and, and he really,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway.|sd
B|But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this|sd
B|I'm like, oh, come on.|sd
A|Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.|^2
B|Yeah.|aa
A|He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had.|sd
B|And to make it believable.|^2
A|Yes.|aa
B|I mean I was, I was believing it,|sd
B|I don't know about any body else|sd

A|I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,|sv
A|it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|I mean, you don't have to ...|%

A|I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff.|sd
A|L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.|sd
A|I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS|sd
A|or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,|sd
A|oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?|qy
A|That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those.|sd
A|Just some of the times they're continued,|sd
A|but mostly they're just little vignettes.|sd
A|A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.|sd
A|Have you seen that?|qy
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|That is, it's, it's really funny.|sv
A|They use like animated,|sd
A|it's not like a cartoon,|sd
A|but it's like dummies and things, that are used,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, it's really, um,|%
A|and robots probably.|sd
A|But there's always a, a moral to each story.|sd
B|And what night is it on?|qw
A|Well, we watched it,|^h
A|the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night.|sd
A|Uh, but it's,|%
A|we've only seen it a couple of times.|h
A|But it, it's real,|sv
A|the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five,|sd
A|and I can't remember what day they call it,|sd
A|but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|Anyway Anyway, it, it goes on, you know,|sd
A|and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,|sd
A|and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And she said no,|sd
A|you can't do, you know,|^q
A|he ran her out, was running to in a wheelchair to hide her,|sd
A|and she said, "You can't do that."|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|"This is tradition.|^q
A|This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."|^q
A|And, uh, he said, "I don't understand."|sd
A|It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, the the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, "No, you can't do it," and then, and then, uh, "Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"|sd
A|and the son was, you know, "Why?"|sd
A|And so, in, in the end he doesn't throw her over,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, he doesn't.|bf
A|and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it.|sd
A|And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,|sd
A|they call it the night of the howling, or something like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they all go out and howl, you know|sd
A|And, and the son refused to do it.|sd
A|He, he did,|sd
A|he thought it was not ...|sd
B|So he didn't go howl?|br
A|No,|nn
A|he wouldn't go howl,|sd
A|so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him|sd
B|Oh, how funny.|ba
A|It is.|aa
A|It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,|sv
A|and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|So it's,|%
A|our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it.|sd
A|But it really is, it moves real fast.|sv
A|It's a real short,|sd
A|and there's always, like I say, a moral to it|sd
A|and,|%
B|It's just a half hour,|qy^d
B|or is it hour?|qrr
A|Well, half hour.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|That, that's all there is to it.|sd
A|And, and, uh, they ...|%
B|There's not many half hour shows,|sv
B|it seems like that,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,|sv
A|but I didn't really see that in there.|sd
A|But what I've read about it, they talk about that.|sd
A|But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,|sd
A|and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|okay.|b
B|What are your favorite television shows?|qw
A|Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,|sd
A|but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,|sd
B|Oh, I love that show.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|do you?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|that is great.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's fun.|sv
A|And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think.|sd
B|Oh, I heard they just canceled that.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.|sd
A|It is a real different one.|sv
A|It's, uh, it's, it's different.|sv
A|I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.|sv
A|But,|%
B|Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I haven't watched that.|sd
B|Oh, it's, it's really good.|sv
B|It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's set in post World War Two times|sd
B|and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.|sd
B|It's really interesting.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.|sv
A|Sounds neat.|ba
B|It is, it's a good, it's really well written.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Is that on, what what station?|qw
B|Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth|sd

A|What other shows do you like?|qw
B|Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Well, she comes on later|sd
A|and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|I did watch soap operas,|sd
B|but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?|sd
A|That's right|aa
B|They're stupid|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But not anymore.|sd
A|That can happen.|sv
A|So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?|qo
B|Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS.|sd

A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|So|%
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I think,|sv
A|I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time.|sd
A|So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We'll catch our news that way.|sd
B|Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.|sd

B|It's been a while.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not|sd
B|I don't know,|sd
B|sometimes they come on and, and say.|sd
A|Oh, that's right.|aa
B|Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words.|sd
A|Um, yeah.|b
B|It was really interesting.|sv

A|So,|%
B|Do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church.|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba

A|so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,|sd
B|and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas,|sd
A|Uh, well, uh, to begin,|%

B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree|aa
A|Uh.|%
B|it's definitely new frontier stuff.|sv

B|I, I, I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time.|sd
A|Oh, have you.|qh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|So what do you know about it.|qw
B|Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.|sd
B|I get on a computer network all the time,|sd
B|and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.|sd
B|They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,|sd
B|it's like they, take off, you know,|sd
B|and then they land, with the, with the, you know,|sd
B|the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but straight down to the landing pad.|sd
A|Really.|b
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's called V C X or something like that.|sd
B|Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|Well, I don't know.|h
A|You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?|qy
B|Oh, yeah|ny
A|Do you,|bh
B|I think I would.|sd
B|I think that'd be neat.|sv
A|I think I would just sitting here talking about it,|sv
A|but if the time came, it'd be real nervous.|sv
A|I'd be scared,|sd
A|scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.|sd
A|That'd be pretty hairy.|sv
B|Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,|sd
B|so you know, I, like I know what it's like to|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|imagine.|ba
B|Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they're talking about doing that again, too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.|sv

A|Oh, really.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|and they're going to put,|sd
A|That's all beyond my imagination really.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, science fiction books,|sd
A|I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons,|sv
A|so you never know.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you never know what, what may occur,|sv
A|but as far as me seeing it, you know, I don't know|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know,|sd
A|but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know generations to come,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, uh,|%
B|it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know,|sv

A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,|sv
A|but when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, you know, when they,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I wish, uh,|sd
B|like, uh, Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, uh, a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, you know, purely commercial|sd

B|Oh.|b
B|No,|nn
B|it's still probably going,|sv
B|but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on on that, because it's not,|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they, they stay at work or go back to work.  Or whatever.|sd

A|So that's, I think that's good. To keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not, uh, necessarily by sex type thing.  You know.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Same here.|aa
A|You should be able to accomplish as much.|sv
A|And I think the, uh, attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls,  you know  you can do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|If he  can do it, you can do it type thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Exactly.|aa
B|I, I see more men, uh, like participating in like the family things with children. Like, you know, helping to take care of them more. And and, uh, uh, doing the jobs equally, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|What about politics on it?|qo
B|Oh.|b
A|Do you think the political scene?|qy
B|I'm not that big on politics.|^h
B|I'm not that educated on it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm,|%
A|I'm real I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene|sd
A|and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for, and even for President and Vice President this year,|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|I agree with that.|aa
A|there's nobody again.|sd
A|I think they're all scared out after after, uh,|sd
A|oh, what was the lady's name that ran a couple of,|qw
A|I forget her name now.|sd
B|Oh,  I don't know|sd
A|But you know  who I mean?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I know who you're talking  about.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|She took such a rough go of it.|sv
A|And they their tax deal and,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|At least she was strong to like try it and  you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|So that's good.|sv
A|But I wish  they would get some more on that.|sd
A|I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.|sd
A|Uh, they, I didn't see any of the women in there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that disappoints me.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And right now I don't think we have too many. Uh, in the forefront.|sd
A|Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Congress woman.|sd
A|And, uh, other uh,|%
A|we really,|%
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I think the first thing they said,|sd
A|I have written this down|sd
A|so it would,|%
A|is it do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?|^q
B|Okay.|b
B|You're asking what my opinion about,  whether it's  possible to have honesty in government.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, I suspect that it is possible.|sv
B|Uh, I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|That's a good point.|sv
B|But, uh, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty.|sv
A|That's an you know, that's interesting.|sv
A|I had read something one time|sd
A|and it was just applying to governments in general,|sd
A|it was written many years ago.|sd
A|It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers.|sd
A|And I thought that was interesting.|sv
A|It wasn't just talking about our government.|sd
A|It was just government in general. From times past, you know on|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,|%
B|So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers.|bf
A|Right.|aa
A|And that would be a next question to ask.|sd
A|or are they in there for their own gains,|qrr
A|and personally I feel it's probably, there's probably some of each.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|But I think maybe a lot of them, um,|sv
B|say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while,  I'm in office.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,  you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth.|^q
B|So I guess it would be like anything else.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|The president of General Motors probably has the same,|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|And they talked, uh,|sd
A|the other, let's see.|^h
A|Third question was how serving for their own gains do you think goes on,|sd
A|then they,|%
A|that's hard to|sv
A|I'm sure there's a lot. But I agree with you, there's a lot in business.|sd
A|I think that's just, I think that's very normal,  that we  should not I think,|sv
B|I think  I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be,  more to the  point.|sv
A|I think we put too much on politicians.|sv
A|We expect them to only be there to serve us, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If you knew what you were getting when you voted, uh,|sv
A|That's a problem, isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|It's interesting|sv
A|because I'm taking a Texas government class right now,|sd
A|and one of the things|sd
A|it's so easy to blame them to|sv
A|a lot of times I think it's our own fault.|sv
A|They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they say you,  get the government you deserve.|sd
A|And it,|%
A|If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and, Especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people's past,|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.|sd
B|It's hard to imagine.|sv
A|Because it's, I think it's gotten just well,|sv
A|we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life|sv
A|and, and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, on, say in the Bobsy twins or,  something  like that|sv
A|Right.|b
A|You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out.|sv
A|I don't think there would be too many left|sv
B|So you're taking a government course?|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|At what?|qw
B|The university?|qy^d
A|Uh, at, uh, it's T C J C.|sd
A|Tarrant County Junior College.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Okay.|bk
A|And it's really, it's really enjoyable.|sd
A|I like it.|sd
A|And then they also, you know, ask can we eliminate, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,|sd
A|and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.|sv
B|You can make laws against corruption|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|but that,  doesn't mean,|sv
B|But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?   Milwaukee, did it?|^2
A|I don't think making laws will stop it.|sv
A|I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have.|sd
A|I mean,|%
A|No,|nn
A|sure didn't,  did it?|qy
A|So no,|aa
A|I think you can legislate|sv
A|but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating,|sv
A|and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know,|sv
A|I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, I mean, you know.|sv
B|Actually, I think other countries may have it worse, uh,|sv
B|the Japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes|sd
A|but when I think about where I'd want to go, you know, this is still the best|sd
A|or I can,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I've been around to a few other countries|sd
B|and I, uh, I, I have not found one yet that I would rather live in.|sd
B|I think, uh,|%
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|at its worst I think we've got the best.|sv
A|Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets  there at your home?|qy
B|Yeah, I do.|ny

B|I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.|sd

A|Well, we have a cat, um,|sd
A|he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?|qw
B|Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,|sd
B|so  he's an indoor cat,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.|sd
B|How about yours?|qo
A|Well, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for some reason.|sd
B|Huh.|b

A|We've had him for about two years|sd
B|Two years.|b^m

A|He can't scratch her any more,|sd
B|Huh.|b

A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|he has a couple of times,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But he's a very possessive cat.|sd
A|He, he loves my son,|sd
A|it's his cat,|sd
A|and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and he's so funny,|sd
A|he just follows my son around just like a dog.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|He won't even let my son shower.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|He meows and wants to get in the bathroom|sd
A|and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.|sd
A|So he's quite a animal|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|boy,|ba
B|I guess.|sv
B|Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|b
A|but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,|sd
A|and we do keep our daughter away from him.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house|sd
B|Is that the only pet that you have?|qy

A|uh-huh.|ny
A|We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.|sd
A|Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home.|sd
A|So, we gave him up and tried.|sd
B|Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh,|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh,|ny
A|we're in a house,|sd
A|but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog,|sd

A|we couldn't allow him to run free,|sd

B|it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two|sd
A|Is that right?|bh

A|It's, uh, kind of country.|sd
A|We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden.|sd

A|Oh,  well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas.|sd
B|This is the very first one I've, I've talked to.|sd
A|Oh, well, great.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've been doing it for about two weeks|sd
A|and, uh, no my, No my,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So how do you get most of your current event information?|qw
B|Well, , see I'm going to school right now,|sd
B|and, uh,  while I'm working, I don't get a, I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of,|sd
B|and I do, like to do other stuff with it.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network um, I read the news sometimes,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's kind of helpful.|sd
A|I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things,|sv
A|you keep up on what's going on.|sv
B|That's true,|aa
B|I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know people around me talk about it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Right.|b
A|Well, I'm a housewife,|sd
A|I have three kids,|sd
A|and so  um, I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then, um, talking with people and just hearing what's going on.  .|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you watch,  do you watch the network, like major network news,|qy
B|or do you watch like  the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR?|qrr
A|Just the  regular channel  just channel eight.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|That's our channel here|sd
A|that's the, um, eyewitness news.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So.|%
B|Oh,  see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V,|sd
B|so it's kind of different.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think,  I think the, uh,|sv
B|I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,|sv
B|but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,|sv
A|and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.|sv
A|I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|because they can, they can only report on, I mean,|sv
B|they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know their message unless you have time to sit down and and probably read something on it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,|sv
A|I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes and, you know, and, and your catastrophes with weather and stuff,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections|sd
A|and, I guess I do read that,|sd
A|and I do study who's running in our area,|sd
A|and I do study what's going on in the economy.|sd
A|It, you know,|%
A|and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.|sd
B|What kind of, see,|qw
B|I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,|sd
B|and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but other than that I don't really read,|sd
B|I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.|sd
A|I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles|sd
A|or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,|sd
A|but I just can't seem to find the time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|If they put it out in a video, or on not a video but a cassette tape or something, where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But,|%
B|Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, uh.|%
A|Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,|sd
A|and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.|sd
A|You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just  more information.|sd
B|If they reported every,  if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh.|%
A|Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|that's,|%
B|they start, already they're having like, um,|sd
B|in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,|sd
B|and they've got like a countdown,|sd
B|it's like sixteen hundred days or something.|sd
A|I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|That's going to be crazy that time of year here.|sv
B|But, uh.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|I can't believe, I mean,|sd
B|they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,|sd
B|I guess people want to hear about it.|sd
B|Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, spring training or whatever|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|and they did so well last year.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,|sd
A|and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But.|%
B|It seems like,|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,|sd
B|if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it|sd

B|Yeah|b
B|he's, uh, a one owner.|sd
B|He likes one boy in the family and that's about it|sd
A|That's odd.|ba
A|How does he treat the other people?|qw
B|Just, uh, stays away or runs usually.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around.|sd
B|You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,|sd
B|but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing.|sd
A|Did he raise him or something?|qy
B|He's, he, we bought the cat for him|sd
B|and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him.|sd
B|But I, I've never owned a cat like that.|sd
B|I've had cats growing up all the time|sd
B|and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh, that's  interesting.|ba
B|So,  it's a weird cat|sd
A|Huh. We have a, a mutt.|sd
B|A mutt.|b^m
A|Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, some lady, she, uh,|sd
A|a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and she use to work for a veterinarian|sd
A|so she would uh, neuter them give them all their shots|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we saw an ad saying it was free,|sd
A|so we went down there and picked it up|sd
A|and it's been an excellent dog,|sd
A|but it's my first dog I've had|sd
A|and we got it because my wife stays here at home  alone  while I go to work|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.|sd
B|So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?|qy^d
A|Uh yeah.|ny
A|Right now  it, it is.|sd
B|You feel like.|bf

B|Well, I just, uh, we've, you know|%
B|when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog|sd

A|That's what we found.|sd
A|Ours is, uh, like a cockapoo.|sd

A|I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, it's a really good dog.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Is your cat a purebred?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|No,|nn
B|it's just uh an accident|sd
B|From a uh, from my, my son's friend down the street.|sd
B|They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so,|%
A|Would you ever want a dog in the family?|qy
B|Uh, we, I would.|na
B|We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I should say a pup|sd
B|and he was just too big for our kids when we got him|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet|sd
B|and it was a dog that we gotten|sd
B|and he was, he was just too big.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the kids couldn't handle him|sd
B|and I was still going to school|sd
B|and my wife was working|sd
B|and I was working|sd
B|and so we just didn't have time to really train him|sd
B|so he was kind of you know, he was too big for the kids to handle,|sd
B|so he was just tied up to a post|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so we gave him to, uh,|sd
B|I don't know if you've,|sd
B|there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they have, uh,|sd
B|I guess it's kind of an animal shelter|sd
B|but he just takes a few the animals in|sd
B|and some he destroys|sd
B|and some he keeps.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we took him up there|sd
B|and he ended up keeping him.|sd
B|Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years.|sd
B|We, we've, saw him just about a year ago|sd
B|and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so we asked him about it one day|sd
B|and he said yeah,|sd
B|he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life|^q
A|Wow.|ba
B|just goes everywhere with him.|sd
B|I, he would have been a great, great dog.|sd
A|He just needed a lot of time.|sd
B|Hello.|fp
A|Hello,|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|Hello|fp
A|this is Lois.|fp
B|Hi,|fp
B|hi,|fp
B|this is Lisa.|fp
A|And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I got a call yesterday too.|sd
B|This is a different subject though.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|this is about changes in the women in the,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.|qy
B|Yeah|ny
A|I think there really is.|sv
B|It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.|sv
A|Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.|qy
B|Yeah, uh,|ny
B|I think you have to push one|ad
B|and then we can start recording it.|ad
A|Okay|aa
A|All right.|aa
B|Okay.|b
A|Are you ready now?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay,|b
A|like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess,|sd
B|she's in her late forties.|sd
B|You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids|sd
B|and I've never faced that at all.|sd
A|Uh, no,|aa
A|I think now, you go to work when they're six weeks old, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you stay there.|sv
A|And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|uh-huh,|aa
B|I think it's definitely gotten better.|sv
A|Oh, I do to, much.|aa
A|And it's just going to get better.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It really is.|sv
B|Because women are in every field now,|sd
B|I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in.|sd
A|Oh, I can't either, not a one.|sd
B|And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|even in Washington, you know, there seems to be a lot more women involved.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue,|sv
B|I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|I think that would be the best goal.|sv
A|Oh, I do too,|aa
A|just your qualifications|bf
A|and that would be it.|bf
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|exactly,|aa
B|not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or female.|sv
B|That would be wonderful,|sv
B|I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, huh|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, you know,|sv
B|Exactly,|aa
B|or the way you look,|sv
B|or the way you, you know,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|your age or anything.|sv
B|I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.|sv
A|I do to|aa
A|just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that, you know, that you have.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|and then,|%
A|And then if you get it, you know then,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, or,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.|sd
B|Is it.|bh
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|it sure is.|sd
B|That would be great.|sv
A|It sure is.|aa
B|Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house|sd
B|and she, you know, we could send her messages,|sd
B|and, and she kept in touch like that, and basically, just worked out of her house.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I would just take her the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two,|sd
B|and that worked out great too.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|that is.|sv
B|And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|All it was, was, you know,|sd
B|I mean, she just used a phone modem|sd
B|and she was like she was sitting in the office,|sd
B|so I think that's real nice too, to come up with different options.|sv
B|Do you like the job sharing?|qy
A|Oh, I do,|na
B|Do you?|bh
A|I really do,|sd
A|I think it's great.|sd
B|Do you work like half days, or half weeks or,|qy
A|Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two|sd
A|and she'll work two,|sd
B|Oh, oh that's great,|ba
A|and we just share off like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you get the full benefits?|qy
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|yeah|ny
A|we get the full benefits.|sd
B|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
A|But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|especially with children, and so many things going on, that would be great.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|It really is,|sd
A|and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you know, of children,|sd
B|Either way,|^2
A|uh-huh.|%
B|yeah,|aa
B|you have your career and your home life,|bf
B|and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children.|sv
A|Oh, it is,|sd
A|it is,|sd
A|well both of ours is school age,|sd
A|but we don't want to miss any of those P T A and, you know, all of that.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|oh, no,|aa
B|I think,|%
B|yeah.|%
B|My son's just in day-care|sd
B|but even that they have extracurricular activities|sd
B|and the older they get the more that you're involved in that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think it's great,|sv
A|I really,|%
B|Yeah,|b
A|and I look for more of that in the next generation.|sd
B|I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on those decision making,|sd
B|you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,|sd
B|that would be wonderful.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|oh, I do too.|sd
B|Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything,|sv
B|so you don't have to, you know, unless you're just really sick, or the child's sick.|sv
A|Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend,|sd
A|or just forget it.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|oh yeah,|b
B|I have to plan way in advance, because,|sd
B|or, what I've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's been real helpful too,|sd
B|like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening.|sd
B|So that's real helpful,|sd
B|so you don't, you know, have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.|sd
B|I don't know how many times I've done that to do something, post office or the bank or any kind of errand,|sd
A|To do,|b^m
A|yeah.|b
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Well I think we've really come a long way in that because,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just,|sd
B|it's always been that way.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I know,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I can remember back growing up, my mother,|sd
A|I mean it was|%
A|she always worked,|sd
A|but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.|sd
B|Oh no,|aa
B|I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,|sd
B|and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did.|sd
A|Oh yeah.|aa
B|I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job,|sd
B|I think men get paid more,|sd
A|Oh, I do too.|aa
B|but I think that's improving.|sv
B|It's such a slow process|sv
B|it's frustrating,|sv
B|but, you can see that it's wrong|sv
A|Yes,|b
A|yes.|b
B|and you just want to make it right,|sv
B|but at least the wheels are moving forward.|sv
A|They really are.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think it's getting better, not worse.|sv
B|Well, I should probably get back to my job|fc

B|No,|nn
B|no.|nn
B|I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or  something  like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah.|b
A|And it's like,|%

B|Whether or not they get it is hard to say like a chair is drug across the * spelling: "dragged", not "drug" in this case|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I know.|sd
A|That's why, that's why I didn't apply.|sd
A|I mean, it was like for me, it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and, ninety-nine percentile on the, on the  verbal part.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It's  pretty tough.|sv

B|I,|%

B|Probably not.|nn
B|See I'm in the Navy.|sd
A|Yeah.|b

A|Yeah.|ny
B|Nah,|nn
B|they won't pay for it.|sd

B|They civilians or, uh, military?|qy

A|I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it|sd
A|so.|%
B|Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps that keeps people  in .|sv

B|They, they like what they're doing.|sv

B|Oh, easily,|aa
B|I'm sure.|sv

A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I know|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|But that's, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Those are few and far between  though.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's like,  it's like, uh, in I B M.|sd
A|In I B M, you can get certain points|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, everyone's a manager.|sd
A|But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn  so much money.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Since  I imagine it's fairly  competitive.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It's like,|%
A|no|ar
A|I, I mean, I B M is like,|sd
A|there's a joke about I B M which says, you know, it's like, uh,|sd
A|all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And then they come in last|sd
A|and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Saying,|%
A|he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right.|sd
A|So he goes,  have you come up with a uh, have you come up with a solution?|sd
A|They go, yeah,|sd
A|change the rower|^q
A|You know, it's like everyone's a,  manager|sd
A|but, you know,  it's like  only use like one person does the work|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so.|%
B|Too many chiefs and  not enough Indians.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|So.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know,|h
B|that can be, that, that can really slow you down.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, that's the way it works.|sv
A|I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems.|sv
A|I mean, everyone's a manager|sd
A|and,|%
B|I didn't realize that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there are, uh, very few.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then the other people just plan it, you know.|sd
A|It's like,  it's like have you, have  have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the, with, uh, the think tank? You know,|qy
B|push paper around.|^2
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, you know, like what shall we do?|sd
A|Has anybody thought of anything?|^q
A|No.|^q
A|And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.|sd
A|They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world|sd
A|and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know,|sv
A|so they have this think tank.|sd
A|And they got to come up with ideas.|sd
A|But, see, uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that  everybody will buy their stuff.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|They've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know,|sv
B|people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.|sv
B|Whereas if you try something different, they'll  they'll say  yeah,|sv
A|And it fails|^2
A|and  you're dead.|^2
B|why didn't you buy,  why didn't you try something more mainline.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I B M  doesn't fire anybody.|sd
A|Because  uh, what they do is they, they put you in a different job. Which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything.|sd
B|No.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you quit.|sd
B|Uh.|b
A|I mean that's their policy.|sd
A|They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.|sd
B|Illegal or something  like that,|bf
B|yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|like  if you're stealing something or doing anything like that|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But they won't let you off.|sd
A|What they'll do is like|sd
A|suppose, you know, like you're a manager.|sd
A|So they'll  put  you into keeping up the paper, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's like how much paper is going in?|sd
A|And then  you  say that's not my job,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so you quit.|sd
B|So, in other words, that's the way they  force  people out|bf
A|Right.|aa
B|That's why they can say, you know, there's  no layoff  policy.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But it they don't really say that, you know,|sd
B|you're, you're always going to have great  career  conditions.|^q
A|Right.|b
B|hey, that's kind  of sad.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|but  I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different policy.|sd
A|I don't know.|h
A|My dad works for them|sd
A|but it's like I B M like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.|sd
A|It's like they won't say,|sd
B|No.|aa
B|Well, they're the standard right now.|sv
B|Or as far as that goes, you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.|sv
B|And the main,|%
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.|sd
A|And anybody can fix it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so that's what you're going to go for.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa

B|Small P C|b^m
B|they're out of Korea right?|qy
A|I don't know.|no

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, yeah|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|for example, you test a chip.|sd
A|It can't last seven years|sd

A|I B M says let's throw it away.|sd
A|Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.|sd

A|And so that's,|%
A|I mean, they're still around I think.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I've seen, well I've seen them around  anyway. You know .|sd
A|So, that's what they do.|sd
A|They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away|sd

A|You know I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust,|sd

B|I usually start in the fall.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And my husband says I do it, you know, make afghans so I can keep my lap warm.|sd
A|Well, that's kind of what my wife says.|sd
A|She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her, her legs and feet with while she is working on it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I know it seems like, she,|sd
A|I think she made three this year one for, uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters.|sd
A|So, those things they take some time to make.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I found one that's real easy,|sd
B|it's, it's, um, um, um,|%
B|shoot, I can't even remember the name of it now,|sd
B|but you make it in strips.|sd
B|And it's real easy to do,|sd

B|I've got kids all over the United States|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|What,|%
A|have you started your garden yet?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|We planted, um, potatoes and onions and bell peppers.|sd
A|Um, boy.|ba
B|Uh, what else did I get in there,|t1
B|and jalapeno peppers.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|always got to have those.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think I had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year.|sd
A|I think one of them died,|sd
A|but I, I've got, I've put them, I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I, there is no way that I can eat all of those|sd
A|nobody else in the family likes them,|sd

B|Yeah,|b
B|oh, my husband doesn't like them either,|sd
B|but I can always give them away.|sd
A|Well, that's kind of the way I am, um.|sd
B|Besides they're fun to grow.|sv
A|I planted, uh, zucchini  last year.|sd
A|Uh, I planted four hills of them.|sd
A|I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them,|sd
A|and those things just flat took over.|sd
A|Um, it wasn't until late, I guess in the summer,|sd
A|maybe it was because it was too dry,|sd
A|they finally started making zucchini,|sd
A|and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is, if they should be planted early or later.|sd
A|It seems like all I got was,|sd
B|Supposedly after the soil warms up.|sd
A|I would think so, um,|aa
A|seems like these all, they all went to, uh, to leaf,|sd
A|and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit.|sd
A|So, I don't know if I,|sd
A|Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon. You know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I don't, I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is.|sd
B|I, I doubt if zucchini is in there.|sd
A|It may not be,|aap_am
A|it may not be.|aap_am
B|Probably the same time the, the other squash is though.|sv
A|You think they're later in the year?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh.|%
B|About the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm.|sd
A|Well, that's true.|aa
A|Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, is, uh, later okra.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well that's about, um,|sd

A|Go ahead.|ad
B|I'm sorry,|fa

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|I didn't do too much to the engine, because the engine was pretty good, but the, the whole interior and then part of the exterior,|sd
A|just kind of do it.|sd
B|Where'd you get the car?|qw
A|Well, we lived, we lived in South Dakota,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.|sd
A|What did you do on the farm?|qw
B|Uh, uh, uh, well, not that much|sd
B|Just, uh,|%
A|Are you just  kind of sight, just kind of, uh,|qy
B|Right,|na
B|I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything|sd
B|But I, you know, drove a tractor, helped them weed beets and that sort of thing.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|And, uh, yep,|b
B|and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home|sd

B|Uh, um, but, so, uh,|%
A|Hey,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what about,|qo
A|have you ever been to Hawaii?|qy

B|Yeah,|b
B|I mean,|%
A|Uh,|%
B|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|well.|%
A|Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?|qy
A|Uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I think that you're absolutely right there.|sv
B|The other thing is, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh,|sd
A|And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Exactly. Um,|aa
A|And that's got to be paid.|sv
B|Exactly,|aa
B|and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.|sv
B|Um, I'm not really, uh, sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that needs to be paid, or the tax that's currently being paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.|sd
A|It can only hurt the deficit picture.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|Um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, uh, bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|So that, that, that's the current predicament.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it seems like it's, it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two.|sv
B|I mean, it's, it's the, um,|%
B|my understanding is what they're what, what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, uh,|sd
B|and if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn will generate revenue.|sd
B|But it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a an unending spiral,|sv
B|and it, it, it, uh,|%
B|I'm, I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend.|sd
B|And, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point.|sd
A|It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do.|sv
A|Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has, with interest rates.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|I think that's been a positive development.|sv
B|I think what that's done is it's, it's, it's help keep inflation from, um, uh,|sv
A|Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|That's the sort of upside to the deficit.|sv
B|It's a sort of a piece of luck.|sv
A|That's the upside to the recession.|sv
B|Yeah, um.|b
B|I don't know,|h
B|what kind of things do you think can be done in, in, uh, in the long term?|qw
A|Well, can be done or will be done are two different things.|sv
A|Um, at various places to look for, for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|But there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.|sv
A|Uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, uh, they should put a, in|sv
A|the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, I think to make, to make, uh, reductions there.|sv
A|Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|I think that, I think that, that I agree with you certainly in the second situation,|sd
B|and I think certain entitlements I, I'm inclined to agree with you, too.|sd
B|Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um, uh,|sv
A|A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician well, and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition, uh, and the school gets paid off immediately, uh|sd
B|Oh, I see, I see what you're saying.|bk
B|And then they  and then the people default on the loans.|sv
A|and then they  don't provide very much education.|^2
A|Yes.|b
B|Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh,|sd
B|and I, I, I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,|sd
B|but, but taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well I guess we're, uh, forced to finally, to do a lot about air pollution.|sv
B|I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars|sd
B|and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from?  Or sources.|sd
B|I, you know, I assume,  that  the major sources are cars and factories.|sd
A|That's what,  I would think.|aa
B|But I,  I don't know for sure.|sd
B|I just know that, um, acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from, would|sd
B|comes over the border from us.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think the automobile definitely is an area and any, any industry that burns, you know,|sv
A|and then I don't know about chemical pollution.|sd
A|I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air.|sd
A|I know we have a lot of chemical, the indoor type pollution.|sd
A|They have offices that are too well insulated.|sd
A|They found people are getting sick,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I  don't know if that affects outside.|sd
A|You know, I, I think, seems to think, seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside|sd
A|and the thing I can, the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Um, I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, um, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which,  has  been a real problem.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it?|qy
B|Again I, that's what I hear|na
B|and, and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not|sd
B|but at last I heard it was, uh, discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought,  initially.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's|%
A|It's kind of scary.|sv
B|Well, it is scary|aa
B|and I think it will, uh, continue to force us to clean up our act,  literally  and figuratively.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment.|sv
A|I think something too that you probably see in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces.|sv
B|I, I, I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't,  do that.|sd
A|I think it will.|sv
B|In Los Angeles they're apparently going to,|sd
B|they've passed laws that, for habit, do you think this could possibly be prohibit? nothing elseseems to make any sense?? for example, people using, uh, barbecues *listen for habit prohibit gasoline lawn mowers, um,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles,|sd
B|and, it's gotten bad in Denver|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.|sd
B|And people in this country are really wedded to their, uh, cars,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and our  economy seems to,|sv
B|and this I think is one of the big problems,|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|we have to drive  so far,|sd
A|but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts,|sd
A|but we're even getting it here.|sd
A|We can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas|sd
A|and you can tell it in the mornings too.|sd
A|My husband likes to go out and jog|sd
A|and there's just a brown fog here|sd
A|and we don't even have any mountains that are,  holding it in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together, the worse it gets.|sd
B|Well that makes a lot of sense.|sv
B|I mean I, I hadn't thought about it that way|sd
B|but it, it,|%
A|You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, they make, uh, making more and more high-rise buildings|sd
A|and, uh, so yeah,|%
A|we can comment|sv
A|and we didn't see this a few years ago.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|and I think,|%
A|It was pretty  clear here.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and I think that, that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts,  and that  there is a, a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it, it's going to tell us about it,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, we're going to feel it,|sv
B|and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy,  uh, in this  country, uh, whether people are willing to get out of their cars,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable.|sv
B|For example,  taxing  people heavily for using their cars.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using|sd
B|and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive|sd
B|but I think, uh, we're going to have to make some fundamental changes|sv
B|and, and I'm, I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and,  houses  we sell.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car, just one person in that.|sv
A|It's a lot of waste|sv
A|but,|%
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|The topic is to discuss the, uh, sources where I receive news.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio,|sd
B|I almost never watch television, as a matter of course|sd
B|so, I don't get news from television,|sd

A|of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it,|sv

A|well, I listen to a Christian radio station.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I was watching on TV|sd
A|they, they broadcast this terrible riot|sd
A|supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem,|sd

A|So|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably, don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made.|sv

A|right.|aa
B|But, uh, I, I'm from California|sd

B|Uh, who wants to start this one?|qw
A|I don't know,|no
A|I've been, I've been sitting here thinking,|sd
A|yeah,|%
A|because it was, you know, took a couple tries before I found somebody.|sd
A|Well, you know, I'm like, I'm not really sure what I think about this.|sd
A|Um, uh, I mean, the first thing is, the uh, if it's going to be mandatory, it's got to be mandatory,|sv
A|I mean, everybody, not just like, you know, poor people and all that, you know. But, you know, senators' sons and all that stuff too.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|I mean, everybody's got to do it.|sv
A|Um, I don't know,|h
A|it'd probably be, it'd probably be good,|sv
A|I just don't know if, you know, I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever.|sd
B|I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision.|sd
B|Uh, I mean, that, that doesn't sound right.|sv
B|Um, I guess I see overall beneficial, if, if we're going from that point of view.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um. you know, in the past,|%
B|I don't know, I don't know how old you are,|sd
B|but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth.|sd
B|And many of my peers were being drafted.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.|sd
B|But I, I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. Be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or, whatever kind of community or public service might be available.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I guess I see that as, as not so much a demand but, but a privilege.|sd
B|It's, it's kind of, uh, uh, It's something,|sv
A|It is, uh,|aa
B|it's, it's|%
B|since we live here and we all benefit, rich, poor or in between, uh, there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. I just see that as maybe a good idea.|sv
B|I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, and I find ways to, to turn some of that back to, to others.|sd
B|Uh, and I, I guess I, I can't see that as being something to really object to.|sd
A|Well, I guess it would still depend on how,|sv
A|I mean, if, if you're talking about if you're talking about something that's like a full time, you know, one year full time, you know, this is what you do, you know.|sv
A|You're going to go and, and fill pot holes and, you know, and, you know, all that stuff.|^q
A|I mean, I, you know, I don't know|h
B|I could see a, a full, a a gamut of different kinds of opportunities.|sd
B|Things that need to be done, that that could be done in an hour or two, uh, a day, or several hours of the week. Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that. In addition to what one does, uh, besides that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I can't, imagine what kind of, uh, uh, bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time,|sd
B|oh, you're going to go to this camp|^q
B|and you're going to, you know,|^q
B|like, um, back in the Depression, the C C C,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|it was needed,|sv
B|it gave some folks some jobs,|sv
B|and we got some great public works out of it.|sv
B|But, um, I don't see that as being necessary now.|sd
B|I can see it being done, uh, on a regular schedule.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, everybody has to put in so many hours of, uh, public service in a given time, perhaps.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I guess I see all of us benefiting,|sd
B|and I, I don't see it just relegated to the young.|sd
B|But I see, I, I see so much going on that, that's bad.|sd
B|And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Something that they turn, back.|sv
A|Well,|%
A|and also, you know, you, you feel more like, you know, you're actually part of the community if you've done something, in it.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|You take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those who benefit, besides yourself.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I, I see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or, or at least the area where the person lives.|sd
A|Uh, definitely.|aa
B|It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're, you're coming in contact with it.|sv
B|It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again, unless I happen to go on vacation, up there.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's, it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual, on going.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But as far as putting that into work, I don't want to, I don't want to deal with the, with the heartache of, first of all, getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics, of it.|sd
A|Oh, that would, be a nightmare.|sv
A|And just, I mean, just getting, getting it going.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, I, see a lot of things like, uh, scouting, uh, Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, things like that, that kind of get into that citizenship, uh, the uh, looking after the environment sort of thing|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I guess, I don't see, uh, this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in, and would take a turn in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Do you have kids?|qy
A|no,|nn
A|not yet|sd
A|In about six months we will|sd
B|Oh, well good.|ba
B|you'll have a little time think about that.|sv
B|I guess, I, I have, uh,|%
B|when I was teaching school I saw many, so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose.|sd
B|And I can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know you've got to get past that, that grudge attitude that many have,|sd
B|but that's, uh, that would be a part of selling it to the community. uh, parish or however the state was divided up.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I may,|%
B|well I don't know,|h
B|around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for.|sd
B|Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will, uh, police a, uh a couple of miles of the highway and|sd
B|and I, I've seen it in other states too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|They have, that here. Um,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|um,|%
A|they've got, um, in most of the states around here I think, uh.|sd
A|You know, down in North Carolina, there was a big controversy for a while, because they, uh, the local chapter of the K K K wanted to, uh, uh, to participate in it|sd
A|and, uh,|sd
B|and there were those that said, No,|^2
B|you can't do that, I'm sure.|^q
A|Well, uh, it was, it was interesting because that's an interesting question, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Should these people be allowed to or not?|^q
A|I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|And I hadn't even thought about that, uh, the, the other end of that.|sd
B|That, that's an interesting, uh, situation.|sv
B|I hadn't thought of that.|sd
B|We had visited relatives in Virginia, not too long ago,|sd
B|and I thought I had seen, when we were traveling around the state, some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up|sd
B|and,|%
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I think Virginia's got it|sd
A|and I know Maryland does,|sd
A|and we just, we went to Indianapolis last weekend, and back.|sd
A|And, um, I'm pretty sure I saw, yeah, stuff in Ohio and Indiana about it and Pennsylvania, maybe Pennsylvania,|sd
A|I don't remember for sure now.|sd
B|And I don't know about your part of the country,|h
B|but, uh, down here in the last, oh, year plus, I, it was beginning with last year's Earth Day There's just been more of a turn toward uh, environmental concerns,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I work for Texas Instruments.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they, they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said, Well, it's not feasible,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's not a good idea.|^q
B|And, I see that as being, I, I see that as being a, a, a change, uh, for the positive. Kind of along the same line as, as, as the mandatory thing.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|And but then they lost, too much business|sd
B|It's just, thing, a part of everyone's consciousness.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, the thing about that is though, it's got a,|sv
A|I mean because it was, I mean it was big, you remember, like in the early seventies and all that.|sd
A|And, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.|sd
A|And I, I'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.|sd
A|It's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years|sd
A|and then people like, well, you know,|%
A|I'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,|^q
A|and even if it's not environmentally safe, who cares, you know.|^q
B|I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.|sv
B|Uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for, just in my life.|sv
B|And if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject, that you, one might care to bring up.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, it is comforting to me to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that cost us money.|sd
B|Especially when we have dwindling, uh, resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf, and, and so forth.|sd
B|Just, just every little bit does,|sd
B|it makes me feel better.|sd
B|It, it makes me feel like, well, there may be something left for my children, my nieces and nephews and so forth.|sd
A|Well, yeah, uh.|b
A|Well, uh, wouldn't,|%
A|it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.|sv
B|That's, that's right, because,|aa
A|Of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say, uh, coming from where you are in Texas.|sv
B|Uh, no,|ar
B|no,|ar
B|because if, we,|%
B|what was it, seventy-four when we had the, the last last oil crisis?|qh
B|And, uh, we started getting smart|sv
B|and, and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And as soon as the oil prices came back down, we, the pendulum swang the other way.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And we need those reminders.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, Oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, my dad's in the, in the solar energy business,|sd
A|so, uh, You know, we're acutely aware of a lot of this.|sd
B|Ah!|ba
A|But, you know, on the other hand, he voted for George Bush,|sd
A|so um, you know, I, I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing.|sd
B|Well, I you know,|%
B|just about anybody you could name, whether I voted for them or not, uh, makes, um, uh, decisions that I just can't go along with.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But that's why they're there and not me.|sd
B|I don't want the, I don't want the stress.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, the, the thing with Bush ...|sv
A|Okay, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I was just trying to think about how I, how I dress for work, you know,|sd
A|T I is a very casual atmosphere.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits|sd
A|and, uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one Because it doesn't seem like people are really, you know, are that alive on Monday, you know,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  then progressively through the week, I'll, I'll wear nicer looking things|sd
A|and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.|sd
A|Uh, but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like,|sd
A|but.|%
B|Yeah, uh,|b
B|you know, that's a good way to approach it.|sv
B|I've never thought about, um,|sd
B|I do plan my clothes a week in advance.|sd
B|Actually, I plan them a month in advance.|sd
B|I usually do a month at a time,|sd
B|so I don't repeat an outfit.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, um, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday, because really no one's paying attention.|sd
B|But anyway, um, I really, I don't work outside of school.|sd
B|Um, I work in the computer lab at school|sd
B|so I can just wear whatever I have on for school,|sd
B|an, and, um, and really it's,|%
B|I try to dress presentable but very comfortable.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that|sd
B|and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants.|sd
B|I usually, uh, you know,|%
B|college is so casual,|sv
B|you really don't want to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job|sv
B|and you have to be there right after school or something like that,|sv
B|so.|%
A|Right.|aa
A|Like where I work, it's, it's pretty casual, uh,|sd
A|it's, it's, I guess it's more like a, a college campus|sd
A|also, I mean there's you know, hundreds of people work for T I.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the time|sd
A|and they dress up like when customers are coming in,  or,  uh, when we have department meetings or something like that.|sd
A|And, uh, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their, the real, uh, higher ups,  like  the the, the T I lawyers, and, uh, those that work for the, the higher executives, those secretaries. They, uh, they really dress up all the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|So  there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know|sd
B|Well that's good that they're so casual.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I  mean, uh, my brother works for T I|sd
B|and he's a computer programmer, or computer engineer.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to having to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.|sd
B|But, uh, he goes to work in his blue jeans, t-shirt,  and  tennis shoes,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he just loves it.|sd
A|And that's very acceptable at T I.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I  believe at I B M they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.|sd
B|That's what I've heard.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|I I would hate to be in that atmosphere.|sd
B|But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building,|sd
B|he calls it the new building.|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|it's where all the executives are.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, and so they were, they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the, all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans.|sd
B|But, he just left for Italy today at four,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and  he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Over in T, I mean for T I but over in Italy.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh, T I is everywhere.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|he was so excited about going.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it|sd
A|That's true,|aa
A|that's a good idea.|sv
B|Because, uh, he just, he didn't, you  know,|sd
B|he's not really into all that.|sd
B|He would wear it if he had to for his job and all|sd
B|but, you know, if he had the preference, I mean his, his preference is, um, blue jeans and a t-shirt,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I think that's great about T I,|sv
B|and also, uh, to get off the clothing, the smokers, you know, how they have the,  the different  designated areas for smokers and stuff.|sd
A|The,|%
A|no,|%
A|Right.|b
B|I  think that's great.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke, smoke area and you don't smoke, you almost strangle.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
B|Do you smoke?|qy
A|So much smoke in the air.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|areas, the smoking area, you know, it's closed in,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  if you if you don't smoke and you go in there,|sd
A|everybody that goes in there smokes|sd
A|so it's full of smoke when, when you go in there.|sd
A|I used to smoke a long time ago.|sd
B|I think that's, um,|sv
A|I used to burn  my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes|sd
A|I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes.|sd
A|That's one of the reason that I stopped|sd
B|Well, um, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college.|sd
B|Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions|qy
B|and, uh?|%
A|Yeah,|ny
A|she always had, uh, yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes.|sd
B|See that's how, that's how I am|sd
B|but my mamma was not raised like that|sd
B|and so,|%
A|No,|aa
A|I, I wasn't either,|sd
A|she, my daughter, she's real good at finding sales though, you know.|sd
B|Oh, me to,|sd
B|boy I have  to, hunt them down|sd
A|she'll buy a lot of,  yeah, she'll buy a lot clothes, at the end of seasons, you know,  and,  uh, just have them for the next year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And she, you know, she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and, uh, buys clothes.|sd
A|Uh, you know, when they were coming up, I, I didn't sew,|sd
A|but now I've, I've learned how to sew,|sd
A|so I'm, well I'm, I'm still learning how,|sd
A|but I'm and I'm getting much better at it|sd
A|and I,  I'm going  to be able to make my own clothes.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
B|I wanted to take a sewing class at school|sd
B|but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet,|sd
B|but that, I mean, that can really benefit.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Um, that's something that I'd be very interested in, very interested in learning.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|because clothes are are really expensive. You know,|sv
B|Uh, they're outrageous!|sv
A|uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you can make for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric,  boy,  runs you like twenty something dollars in the store.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah it's,  it's marked up.|sv
A|Just a  little shell to go under a suit, you know.|sd
B|It is, it is really outrageous|sv
B|but, uh, I mean like whenever I, I was growing up and all, my mom,|sd
B|I never understood this then,|sd
B|but I do now,|sd
B|but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars,|sd
B|or,  um,  or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she always told me it was because I was still growing|sd
B|and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|especially to pay that kind of money for it.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I  have a friend who, uh,|sd
A|she had a, she had a a little boy|sd
A|and, uh, she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus.|sd
A|I mean,  she dressed him,  uh, fabulously.|sd
B|Oh no|ba
A|And then, seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  she finally learned that you just can not do this, you know. *can not cannot|sd
A|So now she finds the basement sales and, just like, you know, everybody else.|sd
B|That's the best way to shop.|sv
B|I mean, I always thought my mom was being mean to me|sd
B|but I look back at it now|sd
B|and my child is going to,|sd
B|I mean, I'm going to raise mine the same way.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, I don't know,|h
B|I just, they're just so outrageously priced,|sv
B|it's just incredible.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|and you,|%
B|I try to,  uh, always catch the sales.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Always|sd
A|And, yeah,|b
A|and you just have to keep buying them, you know.|sv
A|If you, if you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the, the quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it, it depends on, um,|sv
B|yeah,|%
B|there's, there's always a reason why they're on sale|sv
A|Right.|b
B|So that, that has a lot to do with it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But, um,|%
B|well,|%
A|Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful uh, sweater from, uh, I believe it was Ross Dress For Less|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|And  it it was really pretty,|sd
A|it was just, you know, it was just plain, a plain, uh, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sweater.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know,|sd
A|it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it|sd
A|and I just thought it was so pretty|sd
A|and I I got it at a real good price,|sd
A|I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And it was so pretty,|sd
A|and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why, why it was,  it was  so cheap.|sd
B|Uh, oh.|ba
A|There was, in the middle of the back of it, there was,|sd
A|it's like there,|sd
A|it had been slit|sd
A|and they had like just sewed it back together,  right in  the middle of the back, you know,|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|wasn't a seam or anything, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really noticeable, like she was moving the uh, from the outside,|sd
A|but, but still, it's, you know, it's really not, not, not a good quality.|sd
A|And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.|sd
B|The defect.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|um, they don't really buy the first quality,|sd
A|they buy the second.|sd
A|And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds,|sd
A|they'll send them back every time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But  places like Ross Dress For Less and, uh, T J Max.|sd
B|T J Max does that,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|yeah|b
B|we have a T J Max over here|sd
B|and, um,|%
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what do you think about it?|qo
B|Well, uh, the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Um, I think a lot of it has to do with women working.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|I do too.|sd
A|I think it's going to,|sv
A|in, like in the future, I think all women are going to work.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby,|sv
A|but that will be it,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|or  either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just, you know, just continue right on with your work.|sv
B|yeah.|b
A|I mean, it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|They can't  even afford to take off, you know, to have children it seems like.|sv
B|And it, and it seems, if you're going to have kids, uh, that you are, you know, society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, because if you have, you know, two, well, if you go to work, you're, just working to pay for day care,  two  or three, you know, um.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Now, I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were, you know, when I had them and when they were small,  until  they got in junior high school, my youngest got in junior high, I didn't have to work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that is good.|ba
A|I mean I didn't  work,|sd
A|I, I needed to|sd
A|but I didn't.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Steve's, Steve has a sister who has four.|sd
B|She just had her fourth one in, uh, March|sd
B|and she doesn't have to work either.|sd
B|I don't know how they do it.|sd
B|I I don't know how people do it with one,|sd
B|you know, um|%
A|Let me tell you, you go without a lot of things that you you know.|sd
B|yeah,|b
B|obviously we don't have any|sd
B|and, and I don't, I think that's part of the role reversal, is it's okay to get married and not have kids.|sv
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|And I  think for society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to have, have your family|sv
B|and I don't think it's been until recently that, that they had decided that two people was a family.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|You know and,|%
A|Well it's getting  where you can't hardly afford, if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And  I mean it's hard with two,|sv
A|now, we,|%
A|uh, my youngest one,|sd
A|I have two,|sd
A|I have a son and a daughter,|sd
A|and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon,|sd
B|Oh!|ba
A|and  if I had a third one,  I  just don't know where it would come from.|sd
B||b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because I work now,|sd
A|I work full time|sd
A|and, uh, you know, it,|%
A|when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that,|sd
A|that helps out,|sv
A|but still, it cost a lot.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|I mean, just the, you know, the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|and cars and all their books,|sd
A|and the books are outrageous. I mean, absolutely outrageous,|sv
B|Oh, I know,|aa
B|I know.|aa
A|and they're getting worse.|sv
A|Uh, my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her, one of her next classes|sd
A|and it was like ninety-six dollars.|sd
B|Gee|ba
A|And this  book is a little bitty skinny book.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I said my goodness, what is it, lined in gold, you know, uh.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it is, it's getting worse,|sv
A|and, if I'd of probably had three or four children, I don't see how we could have made it, you know, without me working.|sd
B|But that's, that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if I'd of had four.|sv
B|I guess it's always not, not being able to picture one more,|sv
B|but in essence you probably would have worked out fine.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|but I think I would have had to work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|If I'd of had that many, I'd of had to work in order for my kids to,|sd
A|you know, even though he brings in a real good living and everything, in order for me to keep up, I would have had to work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I think it's getting more and more like,  when  you have one child now, that's it, you know,|sv
A|then you go to work|sv
A|and you work,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|because  if you have two or three kids, by the, way the inflation's going I think a woman's always going to have to work|sv
A|and it's just going to be an accepted thing.|sv
A|There isn't going to be any of this, you know, very few people will ever stay home.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and, and that's all right with me, because I don't want to stay home|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, I think I'm just part of the new stuff, that is just,|sd
B|I don't know, I think I would just go nuts sitting at home all day long.|sd
A|Well you know, I can't imagine how I did, because now I work all the time,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and,  um, well I work all week,|sd
A|and, um, I can't imagine how I stayed home.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I think to myself, what did I do.|sd
A|And I think it just, it revolutionized an, where a woman thinks that a way, you know, just like,|sv
A|now my daughter, there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now|sd
A|To her everything is, you've got to go through college, you've got to get a job, you know.|sd
A|And then when everything's set up, then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with,|sd
A|but. I mean it is so far down the road,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|where, now when I graduated high school,  the thing,|sd
B|That's, you did, that's what you did.  Uh.|^2
A|uh-huh,|aa
A|and then you got  married|sd
A|and then you had a family.|sd
A|I mean that's just the way it was, you know.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|And, uh, that's like when my|sd
A|I know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first|sd
A|and the woman stayed home and took care of them,|sd
A|an.|%
B|I, uh, I, I like the way it is.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's, uh, being,|%
B|see, we're from Houston and so it's not so hard for people,|sd
B|you know, you've been married three or so years|sd
B|and you don't have kids, well it's okay, nobody does.|sd
B|But you come to a place like Belton,|sd
B|and|%
B|a lot of the kids here get married out of high school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's  real small town,|sd
B|and|%
B|and a lot of people in our|sd
B|we're the only couple in our Sunday School class, except for one other couple, who are in their forties,|sd
B|and they can't have children, who don't have children.|sd
B|And they can't imagine why we would want to have children. * I think the word might be "wouldn't", otherwise it doesn't make sense.|sd
B|And, I'm going well, you know, there's more to life, you know, there's life in there that's,|sd
B|you  know, not everybody has to have kids,|^q
B|and, I'd rather spend the time with my husband than, you know, spending time,|^q
B|here, it's your turn, you know.|^q
A|Yeah,|b
A|but, you know, that, now even|%
A|whenever I was coming up and everything|sd
A|and we got married right out of high school, well a year after I got out of high school|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,  uh, I didn't have kids for four and a half years|sd
A|but that was because I wanted to work|sd
A|and I wasn't ready for kids.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think that's what it is,|sd
B|I'm not either.|sd
A|And, everybody thought, oh, my gosh, what is the matter with her, you know.|sd
B|They're probably going, oh, I bet she can't get pregnant|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I mean they thought that it was terrible, you know,|sd
A|and then when I'd tell them, you know, well I'm just not ready for children yet,|sd
A|oh, but that, you know, you better, you better just get ready now.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well  you don't just get ready.|sv
A|But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time, they had kids within a year.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I just was not ready for kids.|sd
A|I wanted to get out and work a little bit|sd
A|and I wanted to travel and stuff like that, which we did.|sd
A|And, uh, kids didn't fit in right then,|sd
A|but, it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples|sv
A|and, really, if you don't want the kids, then it's not the time to have,|sv
A|I don't care what anybody tells you.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way.|sv
A|Because that's like my daughter|sd
A|now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And,  uh, even though I'd like to have grandchildren, I can see her point.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Steve's mom finally, uh, finally you know, said that, that God will take care of us when it's our time.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|She finally admitted, you know, she finally told me it's okay if you don't,|sd
B|but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very, very old fashioned family.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, she stayed home and raised her kids|sd
B|and, and she expected all of her kids to do that too,|sd
B|and their wives and to be the, the housewife and have dinner ready by five and, and, you know, be there at every beck and call|sd
B|and, I was raised totally opposite|sd
B|How we got together, I don't know,|sd
B|but. Because my mother had six girls,|sd
B|and, you know, she worked too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,  I guess I just|sd
B|and I saw how life was when she stayed home|sd
B|and it was rough,|sd
B|it was hard,|sd
B|and, uh.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|and it really is,|sv
A|I know,|sd
A|just like now, you know, there's, there's so much more now.|sd
A|All my income goes for things like luxuries,|sd
A|I mean, it really does.  Accept  for what we give to my daughter, to, you know, put her through college and stuff. * Spellingusage: "Accept" should be "Except"|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But the rest of it|sd
A|we just buy things like boats,|sd
A|or we go on trips, or, you know, just the more or less like entertainment stuff,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think you've, you've earned that though.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I feel like I have, you know,  because well, we're just a age now,|sd
A|I'm not old|sd
A|but, I'm older.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do,|sd
A|but now I could not go back and do it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I mean, I did stuff|sd
A|but,  to  me it feels like I must have done nothing.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I think it's just the new way that people are thinking.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think so.|sv
A|But, uh,|%
B|I think it would be neat if, if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you.|sv
A|Well you know more and more of them are,|sd
A|I don't know if it is up there where you are|sd
A|but where I am, the, just like all the hospitals,  they're  getting day care.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Are they?|bh
A|But the reason they had to do this was because so many people, you know, so many women could not afford,|sd
A|like you said if you had four kids, or even if you had two kids, you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, uh, more and more of our hospitals, especially, over here are getting them|sd
A|and then some of the bigger companies,|sd
A|but it's mainly the hospitals.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't know if the T I in Dallas does or not.|sd
B|I know, I know nobody around here does, it,|sd
B|we're, it's too small around here.|sd
A|Oh really.|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|is it Mike?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Do you repair your own car?|qy
B|I try to, whenever I can.|na
B|I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.|sd
A|Well, I tell you what, that's, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|There's,|%
B|although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.|sv
A|Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand|sd
B|and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.|sd
B|And then start getting into these Nissans and the like|sd
B|and I just can't keep up.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I agree.|aa
A|About all I ever,|sd
A|I never was too mechanically inclined,|sd
A|but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.|sd
B|That's right|aa
A|But, Uh, they do still use plugs.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|I don't anymore,|sd
A|but I have on a lot, a lot of times.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|I understand.|ba
B|My last car repair actually had to do with brakes|sd
B|and it's one I did not do myself.|sd
B|I took the car, my,|sd
B|I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the parking brake failed.|sd
B|So I got under there and messed with the, the that, uh, that adjustment to make, to tighten it up|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that didn't do the trick|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then I got there and tried to,|sd
A|It probably slipped loose, didn't it?|qy
B|Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.|arp_nd
B|I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it turns out that there's a,|sd
B|the parking brake in the rear,|sd
B|there's a, there's disc brakes|sd
B|and the parking brake is a piston deal.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.|sd
A|Oh.|%
B|So they ended up having to pound it out.|sd
B|And one of them, they, were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it|sd
B|and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,|sd
B|so I ended up having to buy one|sd
B|and all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done|sd
A|well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?|qy
B|yeah,|ny
B|actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,|sd
B|but I, I don't, like I|sd
A|Well, it was a lot of money,|bf
A|but,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, I,|%
B|it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on|sd
B|so,|%
A|You had to have the help, didn't you?|qy
B|That's right,|na
B|that's right.|na
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, do you still do much work on them, then?|qy
B|I do.|na
B|actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September|sd
B|and, whenever I can, I do try.|sd
B|I|%
B|actually, I'd say this.|h
B|I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because,|sd
A|Disposal is a problem.|^2
B|Well, that is one problem,|aap_am
B|but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too|sd
A|That's true.|aa
A|Right,|aa
A|that, that,|%
A|I've, I've quit doing that myself.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.|sd
B|Yep,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|And, uh, but, it,|%
A|but, no,|ar
A|I guess,|%
A|that,|%
A|and the main reason that it's, it's quick.|sd
A|Well, have you seen a new movie lately?|qy
B|Well, uh, I am a student|sd
B|and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.|sd
A|Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?|qw
B|Uh, let's see.|^h
B|Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.|sd
B|Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.|sd
B|Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.|sd
B|What have you seen recently?|qw
A|Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.|qy^d
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|What did you think of that one?|qo
B|Enjoyed that quite a bit.|sd
B|Um, I thought the, uh, the the cinematography was excellent.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the story was,|sd
B|uh, though it tended to be a little one sided uh, it was good.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, it was, it was believable.|sd
A|I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,|sd
A|and that's when the movie was filmed,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,|sd
A|uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.|sd
A|In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,|sd
A|and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all looked at the buffalo,|sd
A|it was really neat.|sd
A|But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or, you know, they'd start recognizing people.|sd
B|They knew, they knew the extras or the,|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.|sd
A|I'd go now, now which one could that be you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,|sd
B|Scope.|^2
A|Right.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, but I, I thought it was a good film.|sd
A|But you are right,|sv
A|I think, I think it was very one sided.|sv
B|It, it was,|sv
B|but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.|sv
B|I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|and it's just, shoot the Indians,|sd
B|and they are always the savages.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So,|%
A|In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night|sd
A|and, it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but it was an interesting movie.|sd
A|Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Now I thought that was a good show.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That was, that was a good movie.|sv
B|Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Kind of,|%
A|It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing|sv
A|or, uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,|sv
A|but it was an enjoyable movie.|sd
A|It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS series, you know, just something a little different,  yet  believable.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Yes.|aa
B|You're bringing it,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.|sd
B|But, yeah,|%
B|I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,|qy
A|are you going to see this next one that's coming out?|qy
B|Oh, definitely.|na
A|Have you seen the rest?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|I think I've missed one.|sd
A|I'm not sure,|h
A|but I think I've missed one.|sd
B|I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,|sd
B|and they showed all five in a row.|sd
A|Was that here in Dallas?|qy
B|Oh, they had it everywhere,|sd
B|uh, every major city had one theater that did it|sd
B|and,|%
A|Okay.|b
A|Because we had one here in Dallas.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|and they did it in Houston,|sd
B|they did it, well, they did it everywhere.|sd
B|And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,|sd
B|and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but you can watch the characters develop,|sv
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?|qw
B|Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.|sd
B|I have a set amount that I, that I save.|sd
B|Actually, well actually there is a, a way,|sd
B|budget our money apparently.|sd
B|The,|%
B|uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks|sd
B|and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that|sd
B|and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I am single,|sd
A|so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  I basically,|%
B|Really don't  need to.|^2
A|Right,|aa
A|I don't need to.|b^m
A|I am the only that I have to keep track of|sd
A|so it makes it a little bit easier.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are|sd
A|and I am pretty consistent from month to month|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,|sd
B|I am in my fifties now,|sd
B|but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,|sd
B|I had four kids|sd
B|and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.|sd
B|Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.|sd
B|Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.|sd
B|For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.|sd
B|Every six months I have to pay car insurance.|sd
B|Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.|sd
B|So I take a set amount.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in|sd
B|and I also have got a checking account besides that,|sd
B|but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out|sd
B|and I put it in parenthesis.|sd
B|I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.|sd
B|Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I guess that's a way of budgeting.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's,|%
A|I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.|sd
A|I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.|sd
A|Like I am,|%
A|probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind|sd
A|and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, you know, we've got two cars.|sd
B|My wife has a car|sd
B|and I like to drive pick up truck.|sd
B|So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.|sd
B|And you know I am constantly making car payments,|sd
B|but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, you know, I get one paid for|sd
B|and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides|sd
B|so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,|sd
A|Huh. Right.|b
B|but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Have you thought about, uh, leasing?|qy
B|Well, uh, I have thought about it,|na
B|but leasing wouldn't,|sd
B|you know, I don't use it for my business.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|My wife uses hers just for pleasure|sd
B|and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so.|%
A|But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I guess.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you're right.|aa
B|Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,|sd
B|but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill|sd
B|and you got to put put stuff in them you know.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|Yeah,|%
A|mine's, uh, seven years old|sd
A|and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.|sd
A|I had a number of expenses|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,|sd
A|uh, you know the,|%
A|as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.|sd
A|So, I just went through that whole set last year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again|sd
B|Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.|sv
B|Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|What line of work are you in?|qw
A|Okay, um.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|no rain in the last month, I don't think.|sd
A|The ground's very dry|sd
A|and our yard work, everything is in bloom,|sd
A|so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,|sd
A|but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,|sd
A|we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Everything blooming,|sd
A|and, and the weather.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,|sd
A|so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that.|sd
B|The blue flu,|bf
A|Yeah.|b
B|yeah,|b
B|the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess.|bf
A|Yes.|aa

A|Um.|%
B|It has been untypically wet for this time of year,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,|sd

A|Uh.|%
B|but fortunately it rains|sd
B|and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,|sd
B|and, well I guess we're still in winter,|sd
B|and, uh, we have had no snow.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No snow?|bh
B|To speak of, to speak of.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter|sd

A|Um.|%
B|So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.|sd

B|So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,|sd
B|but, uh, I envy you your ninety-four degrees.|sd

B|I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes|aa
A|it is.|sd
A|Down in the more southern and western areas.|sd
A|And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and, uh, very windy.|sd
A|It's amazing to me|sd
A|because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,|sd
A|and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.|sd
A|It does,|sd
A|I, I|%
A|very seldom, if any,|sd
A|I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b

A|Um.|%
B|Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,|sd
A|Um.|%

B|you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.|sd

B|I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,|sd
B|so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We haven't talked much about the weather|sd
A|Oh, well.|b
B|I know that's what we're supposed to do.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa

A|I was looking at it,|sd
A|I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,|sd

A|So.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|In environmental engineering, uh,|bf
A|Uh-huh.|aa

B|So, I,|%
B|but that, that's interesting.|sv
B|I have a, uh, uh, friend who is a planner. Uh, a city planner.|sd

A|we actually, our division is corporate wide,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course we have several plants here,|sd
A|but, um, we do air modeling also.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.|sd
A|What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,|sd
A|and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.|sd
B|Well, that's interesting.|ba
A|And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site|sd

A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay.|b
A|So tell me about CHINA CRY.|ad
B|Okay,|aa
B|CHINA CRY was basically the, the true story written by this, this lady who had, uh, was a native, a native Chinese, uh, uh, who was raised by Christian parents.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, Christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. She had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.|sd
B|And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed or, or imprisoned or, and the property confiscated, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the Christian movement.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents, well,|sd
B|her dad was a doctor|sd
B|and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well to do in the old regime|sd
B|and the, the the the communist Chinese didn't like this at all.|sd
B|You know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Everybody was back to a commonality of one.|sd
B|And so they kept picking at him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started picking on her. And getting her to, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they were starting to, uh, accuse her of, of, of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her write her own story over and over and over.|sd
B|Uh, and the, uh, the major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court.|sd
B|Now, I think I'm leaving out a portion.|sd
B|She she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an instructor|sd
B|and they had her teaching, or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers. When the, they decided that, that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre, uh, regime crimes as it were.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Being a child, you know.|sd
B|So, they kept on and on at, at her,|sd
B|and in the meantime, she and her husband, uh, were were expecting a child, their own child.|sd
B|And, uh, the, the people kept harassing her over, you know, over a period of months|sd
B|and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, the Lord just said no,|sd
B|this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really, you know,|^q
B|she's, she's one of mine,|^q
B|she is not going to die|^q
B|and, uh, the, the soldiers were blinded when they shot.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|And she, her life was spared.|sd
B|And this, this frightened the, the, uh, the commandant|sd
B|and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|Well, uh, and, course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|Well she, she put in for going, going to, uh,|sd
B|and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong, uh,|sd
B|and then she put in to go see him.|sd
B|And over time she, uh, uh,|sd
B|finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureaucracy that they finally let her go.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|And, of course, she had to walk.|sd
B|You know, they, they stripped her of everything, practically besides the, the clothes on her back.|sd
B|And, uh, so she, so she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child that they'd already had uh, to freedom.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh.|b
B|And they knew that she wasn't going to come back,|sd
B|but yeah, she did, years later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life liberalization of China happened,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, she was not persecuted or anything else like that.|sd
A|Huh. Interesting story.|ba
B|Yes,|aa
B|it was.|aa
B|Uh, very moving, too.|sd
A|I, uh, I don't even remember seeing that advertised|sd
A|and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.|sd
B|Well, it was within, oh, ninety days.|sd
A|Oh. That recent.|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|No,|ar
B|I mean it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about ninety days.|sd
A|Oh, I see what you mean.|sd
B|But it wasn't,|sd
B|uh, they didn't have it in, uh, too awfully many movie houses,|sd
B|but it was, it was, in the,|sd
B|it had large, uh, uh, uh, press release.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, uh, I guess what I, what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was, uh, sort of light by comparison.|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy|sd
A|and, and, uh, we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.|sd
B|GREEN CARD?|br
A|GREEN CARD.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, he chose it|sd
A|and, uh, it's got this wonderful French actor who's,|sd
A|it was his, like, his,|sd
A|and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years,|sd
A|but he's never made an American film.|sd
A|This was his American film debut|sd
B|Oh, I see,|bk
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and he speaks very broken English.|sd
A|And basically he played, uh, a Frenchman who married an American girl, uh, in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card, which is what an alien needs to work in this country.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So she was a horticulturist,|sd
A|and that was sort of her dream.|sd
B|Oh, I see,|bk
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Of course, you know, they got married|sd
A|and they never saw each other again.|sd
A|Except, except fate through them together *through threw|sd
A|and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, uh, started investigating.|sd
A|So they had to get back together and get their stories straight,|sd
A|and, and she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New Yorker|sd
B|Oh.|%
A|and he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,|sd
A|but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|you knew what was going to happen, of course. That they would fall in love.|sd

A|Well, they fell into like, at any rate|sd
A|and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever, uh, they did perfectly|sd
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and then he said something, because his English was so poor on, for the most part,|sd
A|he, he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, I never remember that answer|sd

A|That's great.|ba
B|Uh but,|%
A|Well, I guess, uh, in one of the things that, that I like to do with my boys when, uh, when I get home is, I like to try and spend a lot of time with them.|sd
A|You know, they're not very old,|sd
A|so they couldn't do a whole lot, yet.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But they like to, uh, spend time with me.|sd
A|We just, oh, just do various things, nothing really.|sd
A|They like to be outside as much as possible.|sd
B|If it's not raining.|sv
A|Right, uh,|aa
A|but, you know, the weather's trying to turn now|sd
A|so,|%
B|Are, are you down here in Texas?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I I'm, I'm in, uh, Dallas.|sd
B|Oh.|%
B|Okay,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|You know what I meant with rain, huh|qy
A|Right,|na
A|right.|na
B|Oh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Okay, uh|b
B|what,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|what, well,|%
A|one of the things I've noticed is, one of the trends I've, I've noticed is that, uh, it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or, or play video games or something.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I I have,|sd
B|can you hold on just a|ad
A|Sure.|aa
B|I have to answer a business phone|sd
A|Sure.|aa
B|I hate to do it on this call.|fa
A|That's okay.|bd
B|Good morning, A R E, this is Arlene Lister another|t3
B|It was just a recorded message, on our business phone anyway.|sd
B|I'm sorry,|fa
B|keep going.|ad
A|No,|aa
A|it's okay.|bd
A|Uh, so that was the thing that I, I noticed that, I know a lot of people, lot of friends that we have, they have a tendency to do the same thing.|sd
A|And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible. Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing. Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be, uh, entertained that way.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, seeing as you've got some older children, I, I'm wondering, how did you handle that, when they were growing up?|qw
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, there, there was not nearly as much of it.|sd
B|In fact, I, I think things were, were quite a bit different.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, when my, my big kids were, were little, uh, you know, all the mothers were home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, the, the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around|sd
B|and then when they felt like it, they went out to play, you know when they were, were little like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, I, I think it's gotten, uh, very different.|sv
B|When my second one was little, they were coming out with SESAME STREET which he started watching|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, other than that, I mean, there was basically, there was not educational T V|sd
B|or uh, you know, you got some cartoons|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and that was it,|sd
B|but they, they were never that interested in it anyway.|sd
B|They'd rather, I mean, they'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know go out and play and stuff.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, we always did, uh, oh, just, you know, to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We did a lot of stuff like that with, uh, with our kids.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, course, when they got bigger, uh, they were both quite into sports|sd
B|and, and you know, so whatever, you know, they would do, we'd go along with|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, uh, a girl is very different|sv
B|We have|sd
B|a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping|sv
A|Right|aa
B|So, they're very, very different,|sv
B|but, uh,|%
B|kind of the same thing, our, you know,|sd
B|she now,|sd
B|lot of time spent with her,|sd
B|she's so busy|sd
B|is, uh you know, going to, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|like last night was a band concert|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she plays on her school volleyball team and, uh, stuff like that.|sd
B|But, uh, we, we still, uh, oh, like to pack up, you know, just go someplace for the day or, uh, you know, just stuff like that.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|so that's, uh,|%
B|we go down there fairly often, you know, for a weekend for, you know, family get-togethers and stuff like that.|sd
A|That's great.|ba
B|Uh,|%
A|That's great.|ba
A|I know we'd, I'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things.|sd
A|And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, you know, for right now, they don't, you know,|sd
A|just getting out in the front, and just being outside is good for them|sd
A|because they like just being outside.|sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I think, our kids just always dearly loved that, you know, play bounce the ball, or just, uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|%
B|course, when our big ones were little, we lived up north, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and this time of the year it, it, the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, You know, so it's, it's very different|sd
A|That's true,|aa
A|you don't see many leaves around Dallas.|sd
B|and, and, uh, you know, we also, come winter time we'd stick them on sleds.|sd
B|And uh, we had a pond across the street|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and from little on, you know,|sd
B|I'm,|%
B|it's, it's so different down here where you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something.|sd
B|You know, when our kids were little you, you got them a pair of skates|sd
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|what do you feel are some of the main problems?|qw
A|Well, I'm in a, I'm in an urban area.|sd
A|I'm in Dallas.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem.|sd
A|Uh, in Dallas, some of the major problems, uh,|sd
A|drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now.|sd
A|There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh, people trying to get money for drugs.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.|sv
B|It, it, it's pretty bad here, too.|sd
A|It's not unique,|sv
B|We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff. In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that, that|%
B|Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|research triangle and all of that.|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers|sv
A|so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate,|sv
A|but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's really, it's,|%
B|and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or, or or Chapel Hill.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever.|sd
B|I mean, it's kind of,|sd
B|I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it,|sd
B|but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst.|sd
B|They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|And over half of it has been drug related.|sd
A|Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had.|sd
A|I've, uh,|%
A|Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four,|sd
A|I, I don't know.|h
A|A, a number every week.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, Dallas is having quite a few.|sd
A|Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related.|sd
A|Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values.|sv
A|Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I,|%
B|Well, that,|%
B|and the, and the economy is so bad|sd
B|and, And so many people have been laid off and stuff.|sd
A|The economy is lousy|bf
B|They've done special stories on the news, local news here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff.|sd
B|I know, like a week or so ago,|sd
B|I live in a, in a town house, which is, you know,|sd
B|it's a pretty nice neighborhood|sd
B|and this lady was going to work,|sd
B|she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything.|sd
B|And nobody thought any different,|sd
B|they just thought she was moving.|sd
B|It was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned|sd
A|Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.|sv
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's, it's pretty bad|sv
A|Well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?|qy
B|Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we all know one another|sd
B|and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.|sd
A|Well, that,|%
B|It's,|%
B|I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over here.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Most people are, are, retired|sd
B|or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever.|sd
B|So and I'm in my twenties,|sd
B|so I, I'm, I'm out more than they are,|sd
B|but they're at home at night,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I really don't worry about anything.|sd
A|Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything.|sd
A|Uh, I am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs,|sd
A|I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts|sd
A|and, uh, I'm over the northeast part of Dallas.|sd
A|It's a, in a nice neighborhood.|sd
A|The houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so|sd
A|and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|see, that's the same thing here.|sd
A|But we have, uh,|sd
A|one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away|sd
A|and now the economy is bad,|sd
A|they have trouble keeping those full|sd
A|so they've dropped the, uh,|sd
A|they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex.|sv
A|You start letting that happen and they go down|sv
A|and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things|sv
A|so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,|sd
A|I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|Well, lots, right?|qy
B|Right|na
A|Finally.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Really,|aa
B|what, what do you do, now?|qw
A|Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the, uh, Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have, uh, had a huge recycling bin, over at Resurrection Lutheran Church|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,|sd
A|but since the price of paper has gone down|sd
A|like it's about a fifth of what it used to be|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano.|sd
A|Do you live in Plano?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I do.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Have you had yours now?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|Yeah.|b
A|Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.|sd
B|Oh, that's why I asked you.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and not everyone got theirs right away.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, you know, recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|we used to take ours there.|sd
B|And, uh|%
B|my garage was just getting overwhelmed.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|And, of course, I didn't go weekly,|sd
B|so it became quite a big  thing,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh,|%
A|Right,|aa
A|I'm really glad  they do it.|sd
A|Uh, yeah,|%
A|I do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles And aluminum cans some,|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|but I don't use as many of those.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.|sd
A|Uh, ha.|ba
B|Uh, ha,|b^m
A|Wasting all your time and effort and,  Putting it in there.|bf
B|Thinking I was safe  in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this  system under control.|sd
A|Got your routine down.|^2
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle|sd
A|because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.|sd
B|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are, are being tossed in with the recycling.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's right.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, uh,|sd
B|what are some of the things they don't recycle.|t1
B|Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries,|sd
B|just everyday regular batteries. Supposedly, you know, leak and, and contaminate the landfills|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Right.|b
B|and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out.|qh
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|And they don't take,|sd
A|Probably going to throw them in your trash|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's what happens|sd
B|because,|%
A|Well, there are places that take car batteries,|sd
A|but I wonder if they would take,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, not that it would|sd
A|kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries|sd
A|but,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items,|sd
B|I'm sure if people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often to, to toss out.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh, is that right?|bh
A|and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, you know, scanned it,|sd
A|so I don't know why, what that was reading it for|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|but, uh|%
B|Registering our garbage|bf
A|they must be trying to keep track of  , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know.|h
A|Another,|%
B|Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year|qh
A|Ooh, for those who are really cooperating.|bf
B|Yeah.|b
A|Now, that would encourage it.|sv
B|Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective.|sv
B|They've already got all this money out on hiring, uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them.|sd
B|I'm sure they couldn't afford that.|sv
A|Sure.|b
B|But|%
A|Sure.|b
B|uh,|%
A|But the garbage, uh,|sd
A|now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|So that's interesting.|sv
A|Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen.|sd
B|Oh, it did?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Gosh.|ba
A|And we we called the City|sd
A|and, uh, they, they brought us a new one|sd
A|and they did not charge us.|sd
A|And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen.|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|Isn't that sad? You know.|qy
B|It is sad.|na
A|And just,|%
B|You know,|%
B|they paid for those things anyway.|sd
A|Oh, and they must be, Yeah, really expensive.|sv
B|Or, our taxes do.|sd
A|I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't, we weren't going to have to pay for it, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, I mean, what would somebody do with them.|qh
A|Arlington, Texas|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, I never thought about that,|sd

B|like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan you know,|sd
A|Oh|b

A|Birmingham.|b^m
B|the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well, tell me what kind of books have you read?|qw
A|Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years|sd
A|so mainly, text books.|sd
B|I was going to say, not fun kind, right?|qy
A|No, um,|nn
A|but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, you know, sometimes|sd
A|I just read one about Grace Kelley.|sd
A|I love to read about real people.|sd
A|To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it is,|sd
B|because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it happened.|sd
B|You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that was real good.|sd
B|I'm like you,|sd
B|if it's not a heavy biography, you know I enjoy it.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I used to like to read about royalty a lot.|sd
A|I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe.|sd
A|That was my thing for a while.|sd
B|I was trying to think, uh,|^h
B|I read a, uh, a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all,|sd
B|and there was a murder.|sd
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it was some time ago.|sd
B|Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that.|sd
A|Oh, it sounds like fun.|ba
B|It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.|sd
A|Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know|sd
A|Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|in fact I believe it was|sd

A|Really?|bh
B|Uh-huh.|ny
B|I believe.|sd
A|Sounds like something she would write.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa

B|and it was.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've heard that she's done you know, her books are really interesting,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Well, when you use real people like that, I think royalty, especially, you know.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|brings it to life.|sv
A|I know, uh, the some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.|sd

A|it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess another three hour movie|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|And maybe that turns people off,|sd
B|but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.|ad
A|Oh, I know.|aa
A|It's about one of my favorite movies.|sd
B|Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it had such a bad press,|sd
A|I wasn't too .|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's exactly what I was going to say.|sd
B|I was amazed,|sd
B|because I,|%
B|in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and then when it came out, all I heard was just, oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.|sd
A|Me, either.|aa
A|Do you know anyone that's read it?|qy
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|No,|aa
A|I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.|sd
B|No.|b
A|I think it was on the best-seller list, though for a while.|sd
B|Well it wouldn't surprise me,|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So how do you just figure ,|qw
B|Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,|sd
B|today was a beautiful day|sd
B|it was like, uh, uh, summer day.|sd
B|It was seventy degrees|sd
B|so so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan over it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews|sd
B|and so I had to dress up anyway|sd
B|and then I wore heels, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots you know.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So how do you dress?|qw
A|Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I  was working at now.|oo_co_cc
B|Okay.|aa
A|Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it|sd
A|and I wore heels anyway|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And,|%
B|I,  I can see,|sd
B|I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter|sd
B|and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,  it was tiring.|sd
A|I know,|aa
A|it might kill you to go up and  walk up to  the door|bf
B|That's right.|aa
A|but you're going to look nice for the kids|bf
B|That's right|aa
B|and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?|qy
A|Oh, oh, yeah.|aa
A|Well, I need all the height I can get|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I do too.|sd
B|So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades,  uh, older grades, I had  to wear heels.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we too. Um,|sd
A|if it was it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots|sd
A|but then I would change, um, into heels,  as soon as I got  to my desk.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, um,|%
B|Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know,|sd
B|it has a heel on it.|sd
B|They're the kind of boots that I wear to work|sd
B|and we wear them, you know,|sd
B|they're a leather boot that you wear|sd
B|and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.|sd
B|Uh, it's kind of a,|sd
B|I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots.|sd
B|They're not a cowboy boot,|sd
B|but they're just a real pretty boot,|sd
B|but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know, and look like I'm a business person. You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle, if you wear boots too often, you know.|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Huh. Well, um,|%
B|Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.|sv
A|Yeah, um,|aa
A|the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it|sd
A|So I did,|sd
B|Oh, my goodness|ba
B|so then you had to.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and then the third year we, um, got heating|sd
A|so it was nice|sd
B|Yes.|aa
B|Then things improved, right?|qy
A|Right,|na
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot  you know, you know,|sd
A|Oh, that's  nice.|ba
B|and, uh, that's very seldom|sd
B|we, it depends upon our winter.|sd
B|We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know,|sd
B|but most of the time you can wear a sweater|sd
B|and we just don't wear coats much.|sd
B|We often laugh about even when it turns chilly.|sd
B|We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh. Nice.|ba
A|Well|%
B|It's really different.|sd
B|Let's put it that way.|h
B|Are you not teaching anymore?|qy
A|Uh, no,|nn
A|we, we moved to Iowa|sd
A|and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.|sd
B|Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I wear, uh, tennis shoes,  and  jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|More practical.|^2
A|not,|%
A|yes,|aa
A|it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.|sd
B|When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual|sd
B|Yeah, well,|b
A|For,|%
B|I know that  some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,|sd
B|and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|really.|aa
B|It's all right for the students,|sv
B|they look tacky a lot|sv
B|but I didn't think teachers should, you know.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's how I feel too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?|qy
A|Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it|arp_nd
A|but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,|sd
B|Where did you live before?|qw
A|Um, we lived in Utah before|sd
A|and, and I grew up in California.|sd
B|Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,|bf
A|Well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music?|qw
B|Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.|sd
A|Oh, same here.|aa
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|What type of music do you like in the classical area,|qw
B|or what era do you, era do you like the most?|qw
A|Oh, well, I guess I like a wide range. Uh, everything from, uh, from Baroque through at least some modern music.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And my wife and I these days are especially into opera.|sd
A|We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now.|sd
B|Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages?|qy
A|Well, we, uh, generally,|%
A|the places we've gone they sing in the original languages.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, uh, if I don't know the story line and, um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on.|sd
A|Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, uh, you, you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video uh, video tape|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so we have quite a collection of those,|sd
A|and you watch them at home,|sd
A|and they have subtitles,|sd
A|so you, you figure out what's going on after a while,|sd
A|and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|But, you know, the, uh, Dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all their performances I think.|sd
B|What is that?|qw
A|Well, they, they give an, uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.|sd
B|Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|That can help people like me.|sd
A|In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.|sd
B|Well, I can understand that.|ba
B|So, I'd say, Vivaldi is probably my favorite, uh, composer.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I really like Vivaldi.|sd
A|Uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I like Baroque music,|sd
B|I like full body music, uh, with the, um, um, with brass and winds, woodwinds, instruments,  you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Course I like, uh, also string instruments,|sd
B|and I have two string instruments in my house. Uh, instrument players,|sd
B|both my sons play string instruments.|sd
B|One plays the cello|sd
B|and the other one plays the viola.|sd
A|Oh|b
B|So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|How, how old are they?|qw
B|One is thirteen and one is eleven.|sd
A|So they're doing this in school, or what?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes .|b
A|Well, you've got half a string quartet there.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|We're on our way.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, uh, um, I try to enjoy all of it.|sd
A|Well, since you seem to like, uh, Italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess?|qy
B|Um, a little bit,|na
B|but, um, a lot of the, um, music I don't know about, uh, as far as the titles,|sd
B|and I have to listen to it, and and figure out, what I'm listening to.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society.|sd
A|Oh, yes,|ba
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Do you belong to that?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I don't,|sd
A|but I think I know what it is.|sd
A|Isn't that a, uh, uh, see,|qy
A|can't you get records through that or something, recordings?|qy
B|You can get recordings.|na
B|Uh, they know have them on compact disc or or, uh, or cassettes or L P|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I think, uh.|%
B|But they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess,|sd
B|what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the the conductors.|t1
A|Uh.|%
A|Uh, yes,|aa
A|right|aa
B|Yeah.|b
B|They go to conductors, uh,|sd
B|and, and they actually have them perform the music,|sd
B|and they record it.|sd
A|So, they're actually commissioned performances.|bf
B|Sure.|aa
B|A lot of them are.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or they will find out when they're performing,|sd
B|and they will, uh, record the music at that time.|sd
B|And so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music,|sd
B|and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section,|sd
B|and they also have a, uh, more contemporary and American uh, composer section.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I had heard good things about the, uh, Music Heritage Society,|sd
A|but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on on music.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, you can control it.|sv
A|I almost, uh, almost, uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|my roommate signed me up.|sd
A|He got a bonus record,|sd
A|and I got a lot of bills|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|So we have to watch that.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Uh, do you play any instrument yourself?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone.|sd
A|How do you feel about the Viet Nam war?|qo
B|Huh, well, um, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh,|sd
B|I just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I saw that as well.|sd
B|Got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.|sd
B|I really appreciated the, the whole, uh, English class where the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know,|sd
B|the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out,|sd
B|what are you going to do?|qh
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, what for him to finish me off|sd
B|And, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of Asian philosophy  that, uh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, were  you ever in Viet Nam|qy
A|or,|%
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|I was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number,|sd
B|and you?|qy
A|Um, I was much too young,|ng
A|I was born in sixty-seven,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Oh|b
A|Um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age,|sd
A|but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.|sd
B|Well, I, personally, uh, you know, uh, I just went in limbo.|sd
B|I had a passport and was ready to go or um, out of the country or join special forces, either one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, I just didn't know.|sd
B|So, uh.|%
A|Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?|qy
B|Um, yeah,|ny
B|just a second.|ad
A|Okay.|aa
B|Okay.|t3
B|Sure,|t3
B|now. Well, Mark, um, what was that again?|qw
A|Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our the investment in lives and money was worth it?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|not, not really.|ng
A|I totally agree with that.  Um.|aa
B|Um.|%
A|What, what effects do you think it's had on our country?|qw
B|Downside. Um, uh, well,|bf
B|the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there|sd
B|and, you know, presidents have always avoided that as a country.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it's pretty serious, really, you know,|sv
B|lot of things that aren't being addressed.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,|sv
A|it it wasn't, you know, it was never|sv
A|we, we announced that we were going to war,|sd
A|it was such a gradual and subtle, you know um, you know increasement of, of force that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Gulf of Tonkin, uh, resolution|^2

B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|only only it was foggy|sd
B|and finally President Johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.|sd
A|Oh|b
B|Isn't that something?|bh
A|Uh-huh. Um,|ny
A|so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that Bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war.|qy
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|Vociferously.|na
B|Okay,|bk
B|well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And, the plots are more, um, challenging, you know, than the sitcoms of regular T V.|sv
A|Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the only access we have to that of course is public television.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect|sd

B|Oh, he can never cut it|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no|aa

B|Yeah,|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|he does.|sv
A|Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy look,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|aa
B|I liked his accent too.|sd
B|And, he can even be in movies that are not, uh, uh, sexually oriented,|sv

B|I have to get up and, and work the next morning.|sd
B|I wish they'd put those,|sd
B|that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF.|sd
B|It came on after DOCTOR WHO, on Saturday nights, here at least.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it should,|sv
B|of course I|%
B|really it was,|%
B|I don't think they should show it during prime time,|sv
B|but still, it was funny.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know.|b
A|Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher.|sd
A|I, I read as I said, and, uh, quite a bit.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I read about two or three novels a week, in addition to all the technical stuff.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|What, what do you do?|qw
A|What kind of work do you do?|qw
B|I'm a Payroll Clerk.|sd
B|Just an accounting clerk.|sd
A|At T I?|qy^d

B|I'm from Dallas.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I|sd
A|and I just wondered.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|it could be T I I think, probably are participating more than anybody else,|sv
B|but I needed the money.|sd
B|This is five bucks here.|sd
A|I think that's something we all|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|really.|aa
B|Do you work for T I?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|I work for G T E. In Maryland,|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|yes.|ny
B|How did you hear,|qw
B|oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we?|qy
A|I guess not.|ng
A|How did I hear about it?|br
A|Well I work, you know,|sd
A|they are gathering a data base for voice processing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, that's my field of work also.|sd
B|Oh!|b
A|So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this|sd
A|and I heard about it,|sd
A|so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, uh, You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|We could go back to television shows.|oo_co_cc
B|Well, you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I have.|sd
B|I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true.|sd
A|Well, no.|ar
A|That's, uh,|%
A|you could interpret it that way.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth,|sv
A|but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Okay,|b
A|so you can have,|sd
A|there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing.|sd
A|So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that's, you know,|%
A|you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true,|sv
A|but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available. To deny that, at least the majority of it is true.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can look at it, you know,|sv
A|if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.|sv
B|I guess if you're looking for that, you're,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, Well, you can interpret that the, what the T V show, in the same way that you can interpret the Bible.|sv
B|that, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
B|Really.|b
A|But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|ba
A|But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this, so, uh.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Surely we've made it.|sv
A|I think so too.|aa
A|Let's just,|ad
A|it's been very pleasant talking to you,|fc
B|It was very nice talking to you.|fc
A|and have a good evening.|fc
B|You too.|fc
A|Good night!|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Uh, Robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution?|qw
B|Um, gee,|ba
B|I don't, I mean,|sd
B|I, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,|sv
B|they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, I believe them|sd
B|but I'm not a chemist.|h
A|Do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on?|qy
B|I don't really know, um,|no
B|I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution.|sd
A|I was going to say,|sd
A|and, and you, so you understand smog|qy^d
B|I understand it very well|na
B|and in fact I was a private pilot there,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I can remember very etched, etched clearly in my mind, uh, flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and, and really being unbelieving at, what looked like a, uh,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|it just looked liked peanut butter.|sv
A|My word.|ba
B|Thick and brown and so on.|sd
A|And that was, a few years ago?|qy^d
B|This was quite a few years ago.|na
B|This was in the nineteen sixties.|sd
A|I, I wonder if it's any better now. Because they, uh, California has such strict rules, um, about emissions and so on.|qy^d
B|People say that it is somewhat better.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Um, I, I don't know if you heard about the, uh, recent legislation in, uh, Colorado, uh, against a power company, uh, that's actually on Indian land, I believe,|sd
A|but, uh, it has been ruled against, uh, regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon. And, um, particularly in the winter months.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|So they,|%
A|it was, uh, a landmark case because it's unusual to, um,|sd
A|I can,|%
A|they, they were talking about shutting it down, or if it didn't comply and so on.|sd
B|So did it burn coal?|qy
A|I don't know that,|no
A|the information is one of those wire services kind of news, pieces of news, you know,|sd
A|so it's hard,|sv
A|I never did see the full story,|sd
A|so I don't know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they said that, that it really caused so much smog over, uh, the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, uh, piloting, uh, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing. Which would be horrible, because the, there's nothing,|sd
B|Um.|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean that's such a spectacle.|sv
A|It would be a shame to ruin it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to alleviate this problem.|qw
B|Uh, I don't, uh, I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. Uh, maybe just take good care of our cars, and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing. Um,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|apart from that, I, I don't know what we can do as individuals.|sd
B|What do you think we can do?|qw
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|you think, it's more, more to society.|bf
A|Well I guess I kind of agree there.|sd
A|I, uh,|%
A|on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things|sv
A|but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect to deal more seriously with it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I do think that we have a responsibility there.|sv
A|I must admit I'm not always real politically active|sd
A|but I do think that, um, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it's brought the,|sv
A|they, uh, really listen to|sv
A|the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,|sv
A|they ,|%
A|all those restrictions are really too hard,|^q
A|we can't, we can't quite make that go|^q
A|and they don't|%
A|and then we still live with air pollution.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.|sv
A|But, um, as a society, I think we can do more|sv
A|and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, being individually responsible as, uh, in order to be group responsible.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I guess I'm, I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems, and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to, uh, to get rid of the source of it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I suspect that the that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, uh, come to bear on the companies that deal with it|sv
A|and probably the only way that can happen is for, um, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, I don't know how long that, that will take.|sd
B|People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.|sv
B|So, if you don't want to burn coal for power, how about nuclear energy.|qh
A|Sure.|b
B|Well we don't want that either.|sv
A|Exactly,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|How about investing in the sun.|qh
B|Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, I don't think.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.|sv
A|Well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,|sv
A|now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline, so that we don't, uh, run into the kind of problems we recently had|sv
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|yes,|aa
B|yes.|aa
A|and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent|sv
A|and they don't want, they don't want to pay for it.|sv
A|So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|Uh, you know,|%
A|however, it might have had other causes.|h
A|Certainly oil was a big factor.|sv
B|Oh certainly,|aa
B|yes.|aa
A|Um, and I think that's probably going to happen with, with such things as air pollution, when we, when we get serious about cleaning, about our motors in our automobiles then, uh, then maybe, you know, we'll have a little bit of help. Um, uh,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|do you have any air pollution in your area?|qy
B|There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.|ng
B|Uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,|sd
B|I think it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area Linda|sv
A|Oh no.|ba
B|That's what they, that's what they,|%
A|You're talking about from, from the, uh, the middle, middle states, that, that have more factories and so on.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|that's what they say|sd
B|but it's it's not, it's not very usual|sd
B|and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we really don't have that either.|sd
A|Although I think I can tell a difference in, I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, uh, particularly in the summer. Uh, you know, when it gets hot, and you have, the, that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air, uh, usually they say caused by exhaust.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable|sv
A|and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.|sd
A|So I suspect that it's, it's an ever growing problem.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|I think, we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch|sd
A|It was nice talking to you.|fc
B|and I enjoyed the conversation.|fc
A|So did I.|fc
A|Bye, bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well, my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.|sd
A|And I would it like that,|sd
A|I, I like the adventure of it. And the idea that, that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I like the,|sd
A|they have a new one now.|sd
A|The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION. Which it's an all new cast, but kind of the same idea, going out to new places and, and doing new things and finding out about different people,|sd
B|Right|b
A|and I've, I've always liked that show probably the very best.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS, one way or another over the years. Uh, although I never watched it regularly.|sd
B|I'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|those,|%
A|the movies are good too.|sv
A|And I, I guess all, most of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When I, when I started thinking about this, that those are some of my favorite shows, MCGYVER, because it's, it's only one person there, more than, uh, you know, instead of a cast of people,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and, and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider|sd
A|and|%
B|I don't think I, I've even heard of that show.|sd
A|You haven't?|qy^d
B|It's called MCGYVER?|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|And what is, what is he?|qw
A|He's like a semigovernment type agent. Who goes out then to, uh, works for the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, his big thing is that he can take pieces of, little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.|sd
A|He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So he, he does all kinds of strange things like that.|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
B|Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard, and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|See what we can come up with.|bf
A|Do you like the, uh, news shows, TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things?|qy
B|Well, uh, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact,|sd
B|and uh, and I used to like the show very much.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out some, some of the baby, with the bath water.|sv
A|Some of the little things,|^2
A|yeah.|aa
B|And uh, I just decided I had to do that. I think, in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it,|sd
B|I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours.|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|And I just realized, I was sort of like an alcoholic,|sd
B|if I didn't get the booze out of the house, I was going to drink.|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|So.|%
A|I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that.|sd
A|I have more or less, I have my favorite shows|sd
A|and I usually make time in my day or my week, you know, to watch those.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, for the most part, I try, I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Because they're,|%
A|I guess that, that, that falls ,|%
A|and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids.|sd
A|I like that real well.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|well, when my kids were little, I did have a T V set|sd
B|and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well.|sd
A|I don't think they have that on anymore.|sd
B|Well that would be a shame.|sv
A|I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time.|sd
A|I, I remember it when I was younger of, you know, catching it on P B S,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't think they show,|sd
A|it must be in,|sd
A|maybe it's in,|sv
A|if it was in repeats,|sd
A|but they're not making new ones.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I haven't seen it in a long time.|sd
A|But SESAME STREET is still really good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|How about MISTER ROGERS,|qw
B|is he still around?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|Yeah.|ny
A|They still show MISTER ROGERS.|sd
A|I don't think he's making new ones,|sv
A|but they repeat all the old ones.|sd
B|I see.|b
B|I see.|b
A|So that's still a real good show too.|sv
A|I,|%
A|that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten, which is a good time|sv
A|and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go,|sv
A|so it's|%
A|the timing of, of it is good, besides the what's on.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|I figure your children are preschool?|qy^d
A|Yes,|ny
A|I have two little ones.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So they like that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon.|qy^d
A|They come on both.|sd
A|They come on like from nine to ten and then from, uh, five to six.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|okay.|bk
A|They just repeat over again. Which is also,|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|that's another thing that's good about it,|sv
A|when it comes on right in the dinner hour. I can feel like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch,|sd
A|and they're watching something worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do without them under foot.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|little, with little kids the T V set really is a, I mean|sd
B|I used it as a pacifier.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm not sure it was that great for my children,|sd
B|but they turned out okay,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh, it didn't hurt them any.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Some shows are good for,|sv
A|I think some shows, some,|sd
A|STAR TREK, I,|%
A|for the imagination of it all.|sd
A|The idea, I, I think that's one of the things I like about STAR TREK.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And is, is the,|%
A|even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff.|sv
A|I don't let my little ones watch it,|sd
A|but the imagination of, look what we can do, you know, in the future, this is, perhaps, this will be possible. That kind of thing.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Okay,|b
A|well, I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows.|sd
B|Well, I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time, uh.|sd
A|Let's see, how about, uh, MAN FROM UNCLE?|qo
B|I do seem to|%
B|is that the one where they, uh, he always got this, this tape recording that self-destructed?|qy
A|That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.|sd
B|Uh, MISSION,|b^m
B|that's right,|aa
B|MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.|b^m
B|Yeah,|%
B|I used to watch that.|sd
B|In fact, I can still remember a couple of those.|sd
B|They were,|%
B|I thought those were very good.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|they always have,|%
A|I've, I've seen some of them on repeats.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That uh,|%
A|they always had a good plot.|sv
B|Huh.|%
A|It kind of kept you guessing on, on, uh, what was going to happen next|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|You,|%
A|How they're going get out of their latest scrape.|qh
B|Yeah,|b
B|I do remember that.|sd
B|And, uh, I remember as a kid my parents watching the ED SULLIVAN Show.|sd
B|That was really the big deal in our household,  was the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|every Saturday night?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I I guess it was a Saturday night,|sd
B|and I went to see the movie THE DOORS a couple of days ago,|sd
B|and they had this scene, uh, that portraying THE DOORS' appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan,|sd
B|and it was very, very funny.|sv
B|I think it was the funniest part of the, of that movie.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|Well, I don't know,|h
B|was there any,|qy
B|I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even,|sd
B|I was, I was,|%
A|I'm not old enough to recall that one|sd
B|well I guess, I have to admit that I am|sd
A|My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties,|sd
A|so.|%
B|I see.|b
A|My folks didn't, my folks,|%
A|I'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little.|sd
A|That may be why,|%
A|they probably didn't have a T V until I got to be, you know, grade school or so.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And the shows that I like now, they wouldn't let me watch.|sd
A|I had to catch them all on repeats.|sd
A|Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent for small children.|sd
A|So|%
B|Huh.|%
A|I, I, I ended up watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's, that's interesting.|sv
B|Uh, I think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV,|sv
B|people were just as violent before T V was invented, maybe even more so.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I guess that's, that's a different topic|sv
B|isn't it?|^g
A|Probably so|na
A|Well, I think that's about, uh, that's about covered it for me,|sd
A|so I think I'll say good-bye|fc
A|and we'll  talk another time perhaps|fc
B|Yeah.|fc
B|Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
B|Tell me, tell me where you're calling from.|ad
A|I'm calling from Garland, Texas.|sd

A|Where  are you from?|qw
B|I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|I didn't know they did it long distance.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think they're doing it, trying to do it, or I hope they're trying to do it all over the country, because they need to collect all kinds of different different dialects.|sv
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, it was nice talking to you|fc
B|Same here.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Uh, the last movie that I saw,|sd
A|I, I don't go to that many|sd

A|but, uh, it was AWAKENINGS with, uh, Robin Williams and, uh, Peter DeNiro.|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Yes,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Have you seen it.|qy^d
B|No|nn
B|unfortunately I haven't,|sd

B|but.|%
A|It is.|sv
A|I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He is one of the best actors I've ever seen.|sv
A|It's,|%
A|there's a point where,|%
A|the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that,|sd
A|this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less,|sd
A|but it wears off.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh,|sd
A|it starts off with like a tic,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all.|sd
A|And it was just so realistic.|sd
A|The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What does, uh,|qw
B|is|%
B|Robby, Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it was very serious, very|sd

A|He's good,|sv
A|he's, he's talented,|sv
A|boy, he is.|ba
B|I've only seen him in funny stuff|sd
B|and so.|%
A|I know,|b
A|me too.|sd
A|But, uh, well, what was that show, um, uh,|qw^d
A|I want to say Garfield|sd
A|but that wasn't it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, GARP, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.|sd
A|He wasn't always funny in that show, was he.|qy
B|I didn't read, see the, the movie,|no
B|I read the book|sd
B|but I,|%
A|I did too.|sd
A|That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well what have you seen?|qw
B|I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.|sd
A|Oh, I saw it.|sd
B|Good,|b
B|we've both seen one|sd
B|Did you cry through it?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|the whole way|sd
B|It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice,|sd
B|but each was about half an hour long,|^q
B|so.|%
A|Where did you cry.|qw^d
B|Um, let's see,|^h
B|when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And, uh, I think from there on, all the way through the movie.|sd
B|Let's see what else did it. Um, what other parts.|^h
B|I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.|sd
A|I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed|sd
B|I don't remember when the horse got killed.|sd
A|Oh,|%
A|when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that horse has been such a pal to him, when he was alone.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You can tell I'm an animal lover,|sv
A|you can hear my dog|sv
B|Unfortunately we don't have any animals,|sd
B|so, uh.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|It was a beautiful story,|sv
A|it really was.|sv
B|It,|%
B|there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|What did you think about the buffalo scenes.|qw^d
A|Oh, I thought it was awful, and so graphic,|sv
B|That was,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know.|sd
A|I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie.|sd
B|Oh, oh.|b
A|Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|it's not,|%
A|But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.|sd
A|No|aa
A|it wasn't|sd
B|Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,|sv
B|like that was great.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|And there were so many of them.|sd
B|I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|really.|b
B|So that was pretty.|sv
A|And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.|sv
B|I wonder how they kept up with them, though,|sd
B|it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|I guess they graze, though,|sd
B|that wouldn't be a problem.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.|qy^d
B|No,|nn

A|It's not on the ground,|sd
A|but in the clouds it is.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|must be.|sv
B|I guess,|sv

B|In, in complete, uh,|%
B|of any notoriety.|sv
A|Yeah.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|uh, you take a life you give yours.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, uh, that's for sure.|ba
A|Uh, there's exceptions to the rule|sv
A|I mean if, if it's an accidental taking then, uh, you look at that|sv
A|but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and, and do it out of pure pleasure uh, I don't, uh, like to see that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent,|sv
A|it is a deterrent in the, in the sense that that person will never do it again|sv

B|they will.|sd
A|Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.|sv

B|But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.|sd
A|I, I, I guess I been thinking about it|sd
A|and I don't have a definite opinion|sd
A|but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|ba
A|Just for pleasure too|^2
A|and I guess you've got to look at something like that.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|Do they deserve to, uh, remain on this earth too?|bh
B|Why, you know, you could carry it to that if, uh, if they are a repeat offender|sv
B|and, and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.|sv
B|Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, um, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.|sd
B|You, you wouldn't be able to under our system.|sd

B|Um, you get caught with dope there and you die, period.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There is, there is no, no appeals.|sv
B|There is no,|%
A|Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
B|Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.|sd
A|Oh, you did?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I was on the jury. Uh,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Yeah|b
B|Which is funny because I got called last night|sd
B|and the topic was, uh, something about juries|sd
A|Oh, really|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|so I am just hitting it right.|sd
B|Uh, how do I feel about it?|qo
B|I, I don't know.|h
B|Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|well, the one I was just on, I don't,|sd
B|I was an alternate on the case,|sd
B|so I don't know what was decided.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|They are probably still in deliberations on it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, what I found out,|sd
B|once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy|sd
B|and I remember hearing about it.|sd
B|It was about a year ago.|sd
B|Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month|sd
B|and he was caught just,|sd
B|they, they drove up,|sd
B|the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|So he was caught|sd
B|and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in,|sd
B|I'm not in Dallas county,|sd
B|I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had two capital murders.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And last year there were six|sd
B|and this guy is indicted on three of them.|sd
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|so you have to wonder you know.|sv
A|Wow|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, the cases like that, they should,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.|sv
B|You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|He just, well,|%
B|from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,|sd
B|but I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Wow.|ba
B|So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.|qy
B|No,|nn
B|huh-uh.|nn
A|Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again I mean, you've got to do something.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Wow.|ba
B|And I,|%
B|the,|%
B|I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.|sd
A|You're kidding.|ba
B|But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone|sd
B|and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt|sd
B|and I said I can't imagine,|sd
B|I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,|sd
B|I guess I could convict him,|sd
B|but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But they really did.|sd
B|It was, it was really amazing.|sd
A|Really?|bh
A|Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,|sd
B|Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|so no one else would have known.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|It was, it was really pretty interesting.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|What,|%
B|Educational.|sd
A|I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.|sd
B|Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Of that crime|^2
B|Right.|b
A|but he was found guilty of|sd
A|okay.|b
B|Right,|b
B|so you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much to prove that.|sd
A|That works.|^2
A|Right.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, they pushing the death penalty?|qy
B|Uh, yeah,|ny
B|this guy is up for the death penalty.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.|sd
B|Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation|sd
B|And there is a number of questions|sd
B|and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment|sd
B|and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|So,|%
B|So there is a lot of outs,|sd
B|but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Right,|b
B|and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.|sv
A|That's true.|ba
A|I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|but,|%
B|But then you have to look at reality.|sd
B|I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out|sv
B|so,|%
A|That's true.|ba
B|But what is it worth?|bh
B|I don't know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.|sv
A|That's true.|ba

A|Uh.|%
B|That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed.|sd

B|I appreciate it.|sd

B|okay.|bk
A|It's kind of got, uh, oh, just kind of a worn look to it.|sd

B|Did you, uh, require more than one can of paint?|qy
A|I, we put two coats on it,|sd

B|You didn't have to mix paint then, right.|qy
A|No.|nn
B|Okay.|bk
A|We did, uh, oh,|%

B|Kind of fun, isn't it.|qy
A|That's an education in itself.|no

B|Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you, when you buy your paper.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|That's what I needed,|sd

A|I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.|sd
B|Yeah.|b

B|Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.|sd
A|So you know how.|sd
A|See, I didn't even think to look for that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then the,|%
A|one of them was just a different color, different color pink, is what it ended up being.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|And .|%
B|When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?|qy

A|I didn't.|sd

A|I started at one edge and went over,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh,|%

A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it was a hassle.|sd

A|even, all the, all the warranties were out?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,|sd
B|the|%

A|we just moved into a new house, too,|sd

A|Yeah,|aa
A|the only thing I've had problems with is, um,|sd
A|I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,|sd

B|Um.|%

B|it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,|sd

B|and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,|sd

B|the dryer had to have a new heating element,|sd

B|Uh, within  two days of each other.|na
A|Or two days.|b^m
A|Wow.|ba
B|I was,|%
B|it wasn't a good week.|sd
B|I was pretty mad.|sd
B|And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,|sd
B|so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,|sd
B|but still they were through that retailer,|sd
B|so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|it's frustrating.|sd
B|But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.|sd
B|So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all,|sd

A|At Morton International,|sd

A|Um, the tests that,|no
A|well, we test every one electrically.|na
A|We don't,|%
A|I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,|sd

B|No.|nn

A|Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state|sv
A|and they say they are going to send some back,|sv
A|it's like giving yourself a it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know what I mean?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, it, it really, uh,|%
A|I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube  because,  Right because, uh, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|There you go|ba
A|and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first|sv

B|yeah.|b

B|I,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They have nice plans|sv
B|and, uh, but, they don't always work|sv
B|and then you know they try to raise taxes more|sv
B|and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,|sv
B|you know, but taxes get raise|sd
B|so. I don't know.|h
B|I'm not really into politics, uh|sd
A|That it,|%
B|I don't really understand it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's just you know|%
A|Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.|sv
A|Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.|sd
A|There would be no figuring.|sd
A|I mean you would take your income tax,|sd
A|you would have a certain amount,|sd
A|I mean you would take you total salary|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,|sd
A|and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,|sd
A|and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Huh.|b

B|The could be nice|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Huh.|b

A|I think it would be fairer|sv
A|and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business|sv
A|and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,|sv
A|but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|huh.|b
A|It doesn't seem fair to me.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, you know, like standards, I guess you could call it.|sd
A|That's right.|ba

B|Jimi Hendrix was the original.|sd
B|He wrote|sd

A|And, uh, I guess that they, because they hadn't originally gotten, um, permission, from him to use it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know|h

A|I, I, can't think.|h
B|I mean it was just like,|sd

B|there are a lot, there are so many different songs,|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, oh, that was really great.|^q

B|and then when you hear the cover it's like, you know, God, what are they doing.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|They destroyed it.|sv
B|I, I think a good one was, um,|sv
B|there was a Peter Frampton song,|sd
A|Oh, yeah!|ba
B|and, then the cover version, I think, I mean, I thought, was absolutely, it was pitiful.|sv

B|I did too.|sv

B|Yeah,|b
B|I think, I think it,|%
A|I think it was in high school.|sd

A|He was very good.|sv
A|I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh, Philadelphia.|sd

B|I, I loved,|sd

A|Oh, yeah.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh, back in the mid and early eighties.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And then, um, I don't know|h
B|music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.|sv
B|I think that,|%
B|I mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world music. Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music|sv

A|Like Paul Simon.|qy^d
A|Like,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|Paul Simon.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, you know, really that's not world music.|sv
B|But, what, what Paul Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know. drawing from a lot of different sources and making, you know, a synthesis of a new type of music. Um,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|What do you mean by world music?|qw
B|Well, world music is, um,|sd
B|a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,|sd
B|and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say another audience, let's say a North American.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and, you know, sort of, um, trying to draw out the best sources.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|The, the best of every type of music.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Because, I mean, there are some, I mean,|%
B|I, I|%
B|there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,|sd
B|but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that I, I completely like heavy metal.|sd
A|No.|aa
B|I, I think,|%
B|you know, and it's the same way with,|sd
B|you know, world music takes the forms that have really been, um,|sd
B|I guess, I|%
B|you know, the best example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say,|sd
B|and then, and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,|sd
A|So then it becomes a kind of music of, of its own, so to speak,|qy^d
A|or, uh,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|it becomes a kind of music of its own.|sd
B|I mean, when you listen to it, it's um, uh,|sv
B|I think that they don't use,|sv
B|some of it,|sv
B|it's,|%
B|they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.|sd
B|I, I, I,|%
B|a good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis,|sd
B|and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar, if you can believe it, I mean,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
B|You know, he's a jazz performer,|sd
B|and then he's playing with Robbie Shoncar,|sd
B|who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.|sd

B|we're going to have to get off.|ad
A|The,|%

B|I don't know.|no
B|But, uh,|%
A|We've talked our five minutes though.|sd

A|I've been listening to that a lot lately.|sd

B|I, I listened|sd

B|you know, you hear this guitar,|sd

B|I|%
B|me,|%
B|and you never would think that they, that they can actually play together|sv

A|Oh yeah.|b
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I don't know,|sd
B|which end do we push|qw
B|but okay,|%
A|Okay,|b
A|well, um, let's see,|^h
A|I, I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be heard|sv
A|and, you know, there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States|sv
A|and that, you know,|%
A|their, vote's not going to make that much difference|sv
A|and whether you vote for one person or the other person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in,|sv
A|and that person is going to have a lot of, uh,|sv
A|since there's so many issues, this one person can believe a lot of different ways on, all of them|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|so, it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.|sv
B|That's true,|ba
B|you know, a lot of people, uh, uh,|%
B|I think the, that it ends up the people that, uh, vote every time, uh, elections come around are more the, the polly, uh, the party type followers, the guys that, uh, you know, follow the party lines, you know,|sv
B|and, they, you know, just go in|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and if they're Republican they vote Republican every year, you know,|sv
B|and, uh, the people that are independent, you know, are the ones that don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year because they can't seem to, to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's good.|ba
B|I always thought|%
B|it was back when Anderson was running, I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes,|sd
B|but, um that didn't work.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you know, the real, uh, far side of the Democrats|sd
A|they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the Democrat party being liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of,|sd
A|it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like, uh, moral standings and those kinds of things.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|that's, uh,|%
B|and then, and then people always get upset about it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more votes, huh?|qy
A|Yeah|ny
B|I'm always amazed at that, that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's, that's true.|ba
A|I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections, I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, that, uh,|%
B|I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately Catholic type area,|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|and when things start, uh,|sd
B|when, when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired, you know,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh,|sd
B|this particular community is a Catholic community|sd
B|but, uh, uh, down in D C where, where things are a little bit different, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,|sd
B|and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,|sd
B|so elections start getting very, uh,|sd
B|the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's true.|ba
B|But, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I can understand why, why some of the, the rural areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the, the Midwest,|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and, uh, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put,|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|and it's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one thing, to get elected,|sv
A|and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.|sv
A|You know, that's, uh,|%
A|with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.|sv
B|I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.|sv
A|Right|b
B|Uh,|%
A|Right,|b
A|after the war.|^2
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That really, uh,|%
B|Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot|sv
B|so they won't even bother turning out.|sv
A|Uh, that's true,|ba
A|yeah.|b
B|They'll just say, oh, well, you know, the Republicans have this election|sv
B|we'll see you in four years.|^q
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|hope some of the local,|sd
B|well that's what they, they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the, at the booths,|sd
B|they, they say that these older voters that, uh, you know, they, they feel like the kids are running the, the country|sd
B|so they, they don't come out, turn out to vote|sd
B|and they're the ones that, uh, you know, really know what's going on, have the experience and seen, you know, how politicians can, you know, screwup or what ever.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|that's,|%
A|you know, neither has mine as a matter of fact.|sd
A|And, uh, that's true,|sv
A|they, I think they look at it as, well everybody, the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true, because, you know, that's what the media says.|sv
A|Well, the majority believes this way|sv
A|so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their, uh, opinions.|sv
A|So that's, that's true.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in your knee, the whole time your talking|sd

B|yeah,|b
B|that's the one I was thinking of.|sd

A|I want to see it.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  I've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the GODFATHER movies|sd
A|so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.|sd
B|I was just going to say, you should see those, uh, first if you can.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If if you read the book it's, uh, even better.|sv
B|The book was excellent.|sv
A|Oh, okay,|b
A|I haven't,  never  read it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, I was a little disappointed in the third|sd
B|it's GODFATHER THREE.|sd
B|It was not bad|sv
B|but, I expected more, I think.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN,|sd
A|with, um,|%
A|it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, um, uh, Marlon Brando.|sd
A|And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|Um, yeah,|ny
A|it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately.|sd
A|Um, but, uh,  there's  a bunch of scenes from, uh, uh, from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school.|sd
A|And, uh, in his classes they're using, there's a they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER|sd
A|and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know, this you know this, uh, organized crime head.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie.|sv
A|Uh.|%
B|or, uh,|%

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um,|%
A|Barry Levinson did, um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they sound familiar.|sd
B|I probably saw parts of those.|sd
B|You know, a lot of times I'll I'll start watching a movie|sd
B|and I'm tired|%
B|and it,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|next  thing you know, it's, it's|%
B|especially if there's commercial in it|sd
B|and then  the titles might sound familiar|sd
B|but I really don't know what they're all about.|sd
A|of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.|sv
A|I mean, they're, they're all pretty good,|sv
A|but DINER is really worth seeing.|sv
B|Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.|qy^d
A|Uh, late fifties,|na
A|yeah.|ny
B|Late fifties,|b^m
B|yeah,|b
B|I think I saw that one.|sd
A|Okay|b
A|and, uh,|%
B|How about Meryl Streep,|qo
A|Uh, I don't know,|h
A|I'm not a real, uh, great football follower,|sd
A|I guess, there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year.|sd
A|One is the Dallas Cowboys|sd
A|and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|Uh, being a native Okie, I uh, I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing. Uh.|sd
B|I see,|b
B|so you make it, uh, to that Longhorns Sooners game?|qy
A|No.|nn
B|Every year.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|it's funny.|sv
A|Uh, I got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh, seventy-three and, uh, never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since.|sd
B|How about that.|ba
A|But I always enjoyed watching them,|sd
A|I just|%
A|growing up in Oklahoma, there it was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And there's always been an interest there.|sd
B|Well, it's kind of same for me,|sv
B|I grew up in southern New Jersey|sd
B|and the local team was Philadelphia.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they were like thirty miles right up the river|sd
B|and I'm still pretty much an Eagle fan, I guess.|sd
A|I guess you keep those things you grew up with.|sv
A|I worked in, uh, Missouri for a while|sd
A|and, uh, I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals|sd
A|and I was rooting for the Cowboys.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, they were kind of closer to home when, when I struck up with them.|sd
A|I really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year.|sd
A|Everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year.|sd
A|In a way that happened this past season,|sd
A|and I think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.|sd
A|I look for it to be a pretty good year.|sd
B|Boy they, uh, they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.|sd
A|They did,|aa
A|uh, they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't, weren't familiar with.|sd
A|Some of them turned out to be pretty good players,|sd
A|uh, some of them didn't|sd
A|and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off.|sd
A|At least we hope it will.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm, I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump.|sd
B|They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years|sd
B|but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there|sd
B|And you know, they've got a lot of the tools to do it,|sd
B|but doggone if they can't just put it together, uh, you know,|sd
B|they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham, who's just, you know, phenomenal,|sd
B|but, he, he's too streaky it seems.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but they have always been a really strong team.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|and without a whole lot of big name players.|sd
B|They have got a few anchors on offense and defense|sd
B|and you know they, they've managed with those guys|sd
B|and I don't know.|h
A|Once the pressure gets turned on they, they seem to loose it.|sd
B|I guess, yeah.|b
A|See that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys. And the Oklahoma Sooners.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's funny, over the years.|sd
B|I guess since Staubach left, they haven't been able to,  keep  it going.|sd
A|It's.  It's been a rough tow, a rough road to hoe ever since he left.|sd
A|I don't know why it's so hard to find, uh, a good quarterback these days.|sd
B|Well, that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though I think. For Staubach's, I mean.|sd
A|Well, yeah.|b
A|You know, he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform,|sd
A|uh, we hope,|%
A|every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through.|sv
A|In a way Aikman has done some of that.|sd
A|But, uh, the guy winds up getting hurt every other game.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I tell you, it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there, he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they did.|sd
A|They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside.|sd
A|Uh, it's funny watching them, them play,|sd
A|he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,|sd
A|when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I haven't quite figured that out,|sd
A|if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I don't know|h
A|I'm looking for a good year.|sd
A|I guess we're always looking for a good year.|sd
B|So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year|bf
B|or who do you, who do you like to do that this year?|qrr
A|Uh, no|nn
A|I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.|sd
A|I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,|sd
A|and they'll get close to it.|sd
A|They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.|sd
B|So who's going to beat them?|qw
B|Who are they going to blow it to?|qw
A|Uh, that's a good question.|sv
A|Uh, I'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco|sd
A|I'm not real sure.|h
B|Boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.|sd
A|They did.|aa
A|So, I don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team, sometimes it brings in new motivation|sd
A|and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm sure, you know, my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia,|sd
B|but I, I sure am scared of them Giants|sd
A|Well, that's true.|ba
B|Those guys are tough.|sd
A|They are tough|bf
A|and they're big,|sd
A|they're mean|sd
A|and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That, that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|I mean, I wasn't pulling for either team.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|no.|aa
B|But that was just a good football game.|sd
A|And it's funny,|sd
A|you know. You like to pull for the underdog|sd
A|and for a long time I was pulling for Denver.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does,|sd
A|but he's a good quarterback.|sd
A|He's got a good arm,|sd
A|sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard.|sd
B|L A you mean?|qy^d
A|I mean L A,|na

B|Absolutely.|na
B|And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers, what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.|sd
A|Um. Okay.|b
A|I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,|sv

B|The, um,|%
B|I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,  when  my first real involvement with the military started.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, naturally we were at the time,|sd
B|the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.|sd
B|So we got lots, quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. And with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.|sd
B|These weren't, these weren't Chinese made copies.|sd
B|These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty-sevens. As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into.|sd
A|Um, uh-huh.|b
B|In Granada, in October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.|sd
B|Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,|sd
B|but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.|sd
B|The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on Point Salinas.|sd
B|And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.|sd
B|In eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.|sd
B|Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.|sd
B|And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.|sd
B|Do I consider them a threat?|qy
B|Absolutely.|na
B|They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.|sd
B|About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.|sd
B|Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.|sd
B|And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.|sd
B|These guys are top of the line.|sd
B|When they, when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.|sd
B|And they are very, very good at what they do.|sd
B|So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet military, of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.|sd
B|That|%
B|irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.|sv
B|Well, it's interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.|sd
B|So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.|sd
B|There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.|sd
B|If uprisings happen in their sectors, it is, it's going to be a total blood bath.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it looks like it's come close to that as it is.|sv
B|Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.|sv
B|They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out|sd
B|and they, would level entire areas.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|you're from the Dallas area, right?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Okay,|bk
B|you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around Richardson?|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area|sd
B|and there won't be anything left alive.|sd
B|And they can do that in about four minutes.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.|sd
B|They used them in Afghanistan, did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.|sd
B|But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.|sd
B|If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.|sd
B|The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.|sd
B|They drink that much fuel.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Were you,|%
B|have you,|%
B|I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I haven't.|sd
B|As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,|sd
B|I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But,  during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?|qy
B|Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?|qy
A|You mean in the, in the most recent conflict?|qy
B|In any of them since eighty-one.|sd
A|Oh. Yeah,|ny
A|definitely.|na
A|I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.|sd
A|Yeah,|%
A|I think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.|sv
A|It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.|sv
B|It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,|sv
B|it's a matter of money,  to  a certain extent.|sv
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.|sv
B|Uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.|sd
B|They're not really that worried about invading north.|sd
B|They're more interested in,|sd
B|they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that. From Mexico all the way down into Central and South America.|sd
B|The situation down there is weird|sv
B|and it's very screwed up.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Inflation is out of this world|sd
B|and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.|sd
B|And generally the people,  are  getting screwed,|sd
B|and they're tired of it,|sd
B|and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about to do something to get out of communism.|sv
A|I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.|sd
A|I think Gorbachev has about had his day.|sv
B|Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.|sv
B|That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Gorbachev has made his attempt|sv
B|and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.|sv
B|So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,  at  this point.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|True|ba
A|I don't know,|h
A|I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.|sd
B|You mean,|%
B|I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,|sd
B|I thought that was great.|sv
B|But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.|sd
B|But you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down. Even if it's a regional conflict.|sv
B|If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does it, it can talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.|sv
B|It's got to have the stuff to back it, back up what it's saying.|sv
B|If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground.|sv
A|At least they're learning a little bit from history.|sv
A|I mean, uh,|%
A|So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,|sv
A|so.|%
B|Right.|b
A|Um, well, what do you think is, uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air?|qw
B|I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just, uh, I think they put off so much|sd
B|and they're not regulated enough.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well , that's me too.|sd
A|After, um,|%
A|on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,|sd
A|and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,|sd
A|but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do, as the people|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution|sd
A|and, you know, their their regulation that's placed on them is, I mean, it's better than it used to be|sd
A|but it's incredible that they still don't have, you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, I, I just,|%
A|I can't stand that|sd
A|and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that,|sd
A|you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a, we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a plant, uh, a Pillsbury plant, in, in a town adjacent to ours,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know people that work there that,|sd
A|of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,|sd
B|No.|aa
A|but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do, uh, to, uh, make their dough and to, clean out the flour and stuff like that,|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|yeah,|b
B|Huh.|b
A|I mean, it's incredible.|sv
A|And, um, they said that they're, you know, they have a little creek that runs by them|sd
A|and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything|sd
A|and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things, that they're not supposed to be dumping,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and I'm like, if they're getting away with it, can you imagine,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant|sd
A|I can't imagine plants,|sd
B|I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even had you know, well,|sd
B|those chemicals would not,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff, you know to, to break the flours down|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and then they, they also do testing there,|sd
A|and I don't,|%
A|you know, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive|sv
A|but toxic can be, can be anything that's uh, classified that can damage the Earth.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, uh, that they are testing with, that they're dumping.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|you know, like in, In packaging|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, you know, just goodness.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but they do, they do a lot of research|sd
A|and they do, um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there|sd
A|or,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm not really,|%
A|what's it called when you do flour,|sd
A|I'm not,|%
B|Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching|sd
B|but, I mean, I, I don't know what's, how they do the flour.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, we, we're on the southwest side of Houston|sd
B|we don't have that much as far as, uh, aiming in the plants over on this, uh, the east side does.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We've got Imperial sugar|sd
B|but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also|sd
B|and, uh, they've been there for years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh,|%
A|But,|%
A|I mean, you think about it, it, you know,|sd
A|it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just,|sv
A|I'm not really sure|h
A|but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but when they pollute into the air and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.|sd
A|So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the|sd
A|unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends to get stuck there,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air, you know, per, per, uh, per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away,|sd
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, um,|%
B|I know that,|sd
B|I worry every now and then,|sd
B|we're still on a well water,|sd
B|we're not on city water,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I know out in some,|sd
A|I'm not sure,|h
A|I can't remember the name of the county|sd
A|it's, it's where Stillwater is or, sweet,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|no|ar
A|I'm not sure,|h
A|I know it,|^h
A|I think it's, uh,|%
A|I know we have a piece property there,|sd
A|it's called Dublin,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's in Dublin, Texas.|sd
A|I'm not really sure what the county,|sd
A|it's Stephen,|sd
A|no|ar
A|Stephenville.|sd
B|Oh, okay,|b
B|okay.|b
A|Okay,|b
A|where Stephenville's at, they've had a lot of problems because they've, um, introduced a lot of dairies there,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, they have a lot of cattle in the area,|sd
A|I mean, they've got like per, per, uh, per lot,|sd
A|you know, they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't|sd
A|it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,|sd
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|they've got to have them there to be able to milk them.|sd
A|And they,|%
A|and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow produces, like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|One cow,|sd
A|I was like, my God,|sd
A|and they,|%
A|and this thing says that, that, you know, people think, well, cow manure is good for fertilizer|sd
A|but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not, it's not|sd
A|when, you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it|sd
A|and they've added humus and stuff that, breaks it down,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and this, and this article said that they've got a real problem that, um, you've got toxins and, and, uh, bacteria in the manure that is,|sd
A|what it's doing is it's going through, uh,|sd
A|they don't have a very deep, um,|sd
A|you know, their water, their natural water, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I forget what that's called with, you know,|sd
A|it's like a spring, spring water,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but it's below the surface|sd
A|it's not very far down,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and they're like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, their they're water in that town will be totally polluted,|sd
B|It will.|ba
A|and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|and the|%
A|and I'm like my God, you know, just from that one, you know, just from them introducing dairy farms, in that one county.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|not when you figure,|sd
A|I didn't realize a cow, one cow produces that much manure|sd
A|and they were talking like, thousands of cows, you know, they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area.|sd
B|These are well fed .|sd
B|These are,|%
A|You,|%
B|Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh,|ba
A|Well, they are evidently.|aa
A|But, um, I mean, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but when they get them in these tiny little areas, you know, and they've got a real big problem,|sd
A|and they, they said that, that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to, uh, these like ponds that they had to filter it with,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just, overflow|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they overflow into the, the creeks and stuff in the area.|sd
A|So, that just creates,|sd
A|you know, there, there's,|%
A|and, oh, it was just disgusting|sv
A|it said the creeks will foam.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|People, people stand outside their houses and their, watch the creeks foam brown and all,|sd
B|Oh, now that's bad.|ba
A|and I'm just like, oh, my gosh,|sd
A|and the smell is really bad they|sd
B|Oh, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I, I don't know|h
A|it really frightens me though as far as the, when you think about the, you know, thinking of just air pollution itself|sd
A|and then, and, channel thirteen they're really, um, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|if we, if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for, um, just the, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know, because how can you tell where it's going to come down at.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|And then cutting the trees, you know, that bothers me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|As far as, you know the|%
A|The rain forest and all.|^2
B|yes,|aa
B|uh, we've been wanting to,|sd
B|well, not me|h
B|but, uh, it's been or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here,|sd
B|I'm like, no,|sd
B|you know, for what's cut down here, you know, more will be cut down someplace else|sd
B|and it will just take that longer to grow back,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and trees help so that, uh,|sd
B|I don't,|h
A|Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide, they use that where we can't synthesize it|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they're synthesizing it for us.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right,|b
B|believe me it's just so much better.|sv
A|Yeah.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and|%
A|you know, they're|%

A|seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying, okay, we're really going to get involved|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it, it's really becoming a problem.|sv
A|By the year two thousand there will,|sd

B|Yeah|b
A|Well, uh, I've had teenagers|sd
A|and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers,|sd
A|and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.|sd
A|Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far.|sv
A|And the young people are overly impressed.|sv
A|And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.|sv
B|That's true.|ba
A|Uh, I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.|sd
B|Um, me either.|sd
B|I, I went to college and then started working and then got married|sd
B|and,|%

A|I read somewhere,|sd
A|and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college|sd
A|and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States.|sd
A|Have you ever heard about that one?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I haven't,|sd
B|I know that, uh, my sister,|sd
B|I have a twin sister|sd
B|and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas|sd
B|and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Uh-huh.|ny
B|If it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live.|sd
A|And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|she only taught there one year|sd
B|but I,|%
A|But she got credits for it?|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|That's very interesting.|ba
B|And, um, I think it would be,|%
B|I know that also one of my cousins who, uh, he is in like the therapy type thing|sd
B|and he was, um,|%
B|some group paid part of his college income|sd
B|but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh,|sd
B|I mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So, you know, if,|%
B|I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think that is an excellent program,|sv
A|I really do.|sv
A|I like that.|sd
A|And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|As far as yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff, yeah.|^2
A|Right,|aa
A|you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but we could find one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I, I can see the advantage to that one.|sd
A|The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?|qy
B|I really don't know that much about it,|sd
B|you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when,|sd
A|It's still in existence.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And don't they go into other countries and stuff?|qy
A|I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, uh, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Things that make the,|%
B|yeah.|b
B|Make them more self-supporting?|qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
A|They,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|you're right,|sv
A|I think it's a sixties program.|sd
A|I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he,|sd
A|that was his big deal.|sd
B|But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren|sd
A|and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But there's a,|%
B|I don't, I don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,|sd
A|Mandatory just like, like the draft.|^2
A|No.|aa
B|I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,|sd
A|Every time you,|^2
A|They could buy their way out.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else|sv
A|Right,|b
A|you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.|sv
A|But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here,|sd
A|and maybe this is why this has died out.|sv
A|Can you go into,|%
A|and this wasn't the question|sd
A|but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults,|sv
A|can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of|qy
A|the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time,|sd
A|but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation|sv
A|and teach them to farm and teach them|qy
A|and it doesn't do any good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know that it does.|sd
A|I, I, don't know that, um, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, we're losing certain, races of people.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out.|sv
A|There's a German word for it that's elegant,|sd
A|but I never can remember what it was,|sd
A|uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, when we were in Australia, uh,|sd
A|sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore,|sd
A|and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else|sd
A|and that's sad.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people,|sv
A|and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is, really an effective tool.|sv
B|Well,|%
B|Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.|sd
A|Good point.|ba
A|We've got enough without without a passport|sv
A|there's plenty.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yes.|b
A|I think we ought to worry about our own species.|sv
B|And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.|sv
A|I wonder now in,|%
A|and I've been out of school too long to answer this,|sd
A|but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.|sd
B|There probably are, you know,|sv
B|for|%
B|but I'm sure,|sv
B|that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff|sv
B|but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know,|sv
B|and|%
B|I'm not saying just give them money|sd
B|but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be,|sd
A|That's the last thing you want, to do.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money|sv
B|or, what was it|^h
B|they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people,|sd
B|I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's exactly it.|sv
B|but.|%
A|They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it.|sv
A|Now come on, let's be realistic,|ad
B|Yeah.|b
A|that's just not realistic.|sv
B|Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,|^2
A|Right.|aa
B|I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here,|sv
B|but.|%
A|No,|ar
A|we're not I don't think.|sv
A|I think, that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I mean it's,|%
B|True.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's a lot more realistic.|sv
A|Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time|sv
A|and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, we've got plenty,|sv
A|in fact, we've got far too many.|sv
A|You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?|qy
B|Flower Mound,|na
B|yeah.|ny
B|So, we're a little you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.|sd
A|I was,|%
A|that's exactly what I was going to ask you.|sd
A|Have you ever, have, have you been downtown|qy
A|Start.|ad
B|What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?|qw
A|Um,|%
A|well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,|sd
A|and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatever other combination there is.|sd
A|And, and I think they've got a uh, some kind of container for aluminum.|sd
B|Plano's doing real good on that.|sd
B|They have, uh, they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans. Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and of course it doesn't fit right now.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But now we start in May, breaking it down,|sd
B|and they're picking it all up.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So they're going to by,|sd
B|and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,|sd
B|and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up from your yard,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  we put that in disposable bags,|sd
B|and they pick that up on Monday.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So it's really great.|sd
B|I, I'm really going head, you know, completely for it,|sd
B|I think it's marvelous.|sd
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Well, Rowlett had sent, sent out a survey, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.|sd
A|And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably, because they're going to do it.|sd
A|I don't know how, how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,|sd
A|but they're, they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months.|sd
B|Well, does your, uh,|qy
B|where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?|qy
A|Um, I've never noticed that.|no
A|We don't have a, a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,|sd
A|so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria. Um,|sd
B|Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?|qy
A|Um, no.|nn
A|There's, there's only one pop machine|sd
A|and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,|sd
A|so, uh, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.|sd
B|So you don't have much choice there.|bf
A|No|aa
A|Not, not really.|sd
B|Well I work at, uh, J C Penny|sd
B|and last week they brought,|sd
B|they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they're going to recycle them.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in|sd
B|and they brought it down to the shelters.|sd
B|And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of for cans for people have pop,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they put them right near where they have the time cards.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it works great.|sd
B|And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.|sd
A|That's good.|ba
B|So they're really going at it,|sd
B|and I think it's marvelous because,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.|sd
B|Well,|%
A|And I think they're trying to, to make some changes.|sd
A|I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,  rather  than bag it up, because of all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's, uh, I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.|sd
B|Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?|qy
A|I saw part of that.|na
B|It was good.|sv
B|The only thing I thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water,  and  to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I've already gone to,|sd
B|oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago,|sd
B|but, yeah|%
B|I would say five years ago, turning off my fountain, I mean my water faucet,  in  the sink when I brush my teeth.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|That  was surprising to me.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.|sd
B|I'm trying to think,|sd
B|I didn't miss too many,|sd
B|I can't remember what my score was,|sd
B|but I did exceeding well.|sd
B|I was surprised.|sd
B|But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.|sd
B|That was a shocker to me.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well there are a lot of things that aren't,|sd
A|I'm ,|%
A|that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,|sd
A|uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.|sd
A|I, I wonder about some of the products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.|sd
B|Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,|sd
B|and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,|sd
B|and it cost more than regular paper.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,|sd
B|but, It upset me to realize that, hey, the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but people aren't buying it,|sd
B|so the cost of it is higher.|sd
A|True.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|I noticed that about things like|sd
A|I I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,|sd
A|but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,  what  the regular things you, fertilizers and things you buy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, in, in terms of that,|%
A|it's,|%
A|you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,|sv
A|but the cost is kind of prohibitive.|sv
B|Now, see that's recycling, you know,|sd
B|companies that do at least go into it,|sd
B|I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So that people would use this stuff over again.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's a good idea.|ba
B|It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the recycle ones are better to use,|sd
B|but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|true.|ba
B|And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.|sv
B|I had to put my bifocals on to see it|sd
A|Um.|%
B|That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.|sv
B|You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,|sv
B|it's not recyclable.|^q
A|I, I'd heard something stranger,|sd
A|talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the,|sd
A|I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs, as a, a reinforcement for roads. For road repairs.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,|sd
A|and, they don't expand or, or contract when the weather changes,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.|sd
B|You know they're,|%
B|along that same line, they said they were using, um,|sd
B|what is, oh, I know,|^h
B|it was toilets. You know, the old ones? Smashing them up, because they're, that stuff there is great for, in road work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh.|b
B|And I thought, well, that's good.|sd
B|And then I saw recycling on tires between, uh,|sd
B|well, hoses were being used,  and,  uh, uh, soaker hoses, made out of old tires.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|What else,|%
B|something else was made out of old tires,|^h
B|I was trying to remember what it was. Oh, I can't think of it now.|^h
B|But I was, I was trying to get my, uh, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,|sd
B|but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,|sd
B|and then I forget to bring them in the store.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.|sd
B|I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I never realized, I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.|sd
A|Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.|sv
A|I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in, in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.|sv
B|You know what I'd like to see a little more.|sd
B|I don't have any little tiny kids,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|True.|ba
B|Because it's,|%
B|we've all got to do it right now.|sv
B|I just,|%
B|I really amazed to find out that, what is it, eighty per cent are filled now, in, in garbage fills.|sd
B|In five years we're supposed to be at max.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't think I can keep my own garbage.|sd
B|I mean, I might not have that much,|sd
B|but I wouldn't,|sd
A|I have, uh,|%
A|I, well, I used to have the opinion that there that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, uh, before, uh,|sd
A|simply because.|%
A|The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, uh, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.|sv
B|Compile more statistics.|bf
A|That's right,|aa
A|and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.|sv
B|More especially where you are.|aa
B|Are you, in Washington D C or Washington state?|qy
A|Well, yeah.|b
A|No,|nn
A|I am in, I am in Washington D C.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|I was going to say,|%
A|Actually it,|%
A|you know, I do a lot of business here,|sd
A|and I come here quite often|sd
A|and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. Regardless of the racial makeup,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|but it's, it's real, uh,|%
A|there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they, uh,|sd
B|It just really grabs your attention.|ba
A|Yeah.|aa
B|It just makes the whole place seem like that.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess, uh, uh,|sd
A|when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, Bennett, I think his name was, became the drug czar, uh, for, uh, President Bush, he was going to focus on it, on this area and do something about it|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I see that even he was met without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.|sd
B|What do you, what do you think is causing all this,|qo
A|Well,|%
B|because, it seems that there|%
B|even though|%
B|crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity, and violence too.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Well, I, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.|sd
A|I have one theory,|sd
A|and it's brought to us by two things.|sd
A|One I, I believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,|sd
A|I am not even, I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey and, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled with a fight. You know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument.|sv
A|And, and then I, I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,|sd
A|so I think that particularly|%
A|I, I was reading the other day about, uh, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the the highest,|sd
A|I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America uh, per capita.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I was, I have not seen that,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
A|I mean the Saturday night special stuff|sd
A|so,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|That, that's what I think about it,|sd
A|that's some of the things I think about it,|sd
A|plus like drop I do not know,|sd
A|what are your views?|qo
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|I tend to agree with you with, you know,|aa
B|it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some, some sort of violence, or something in it.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|And, and along with that, you know,|%
B|and then you start making a movie and it has no, there's no call for something violent,|sv
B|but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it|sv
A|well that's, that's, that's the impression I get, you know.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I, and I imagine that it's, you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,|sv
A|people want to,|%
A|it conditions people to it|sv
A|and, uh, you have to|%
A|it has to be even, uh, magnified to to attract people's attention. I guess, to have them spend money on something like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you become callous.|bf
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women|sv
A|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|uh, I mean I, I, read now where we are, you know,|sd
A|women are young women are arrested fighting with knives over, over whatever. whatever reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,|arp_nd
A|but, that's what|%
A|seems that those things happened did not happen in that manner before television.|sv
A|And I, I, I, I have to think that, that it has some influence on it.|sv
A|But,|%
B|I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I do not know if you listen to him or not,|qy^d
A|No.|nn
B|he's on A M,|sd
B|but, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the,|sd
B|there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,|sd
A|Oh, yes.|ny
B|and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.|sd
B|For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids,|sd
B|and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".|sd
B|And people, I, I, I, I guess they confused discipline with punishment.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, just,|%
B|it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.|sv
B|It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.|sv
B|And I disagree,|ar
B|and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
A|Well, I mean, I, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, uh, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, that, uh, there's so there's so much of a return from to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.|sv
A|And, and that is not emphasized.|sv
A|I recognize there's, there's over crowding problems|sd
A|and, and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that that's complicated the entire process.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|What I also think that,|%
A|I guess it's the reflection of the society where, where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, uh,|sv
A|you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you, where you live|sv
A|or. I do not mean attachment and responsibility,|sd
A|I guess I mean any sort of,|%
B|Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.|sv
B|It's like, oh boy, I wish they would stop doing that.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|I, I do not know how that's,|h
A|I do not think it's done by, uh,|h
A|the changes come simply by statutory nature.|sv
A|I do not know what it really will take|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And, I do not know if I have solutions, except, except to,|sd
A|you know, I am sort of a, a, an advocate of, of, uh, of letting people, of having free speech|sd
A|and I guess to curb, uh,|%
A|television, uh, the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|However, there does seem to be a,|%
A|right now in verbalizing,|%
A|it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then how many,|%
A|And the sacrifice is not that great.|sv
B|How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between, you know, what you see and how|qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|I think, I think that's correct.|aa
B|And, yes|%
B|but, you know, as soon as you start, uh,|%
A|Well, Texas has, uh, Texas has, uh, has always struck me,|sd
A|I mean I, I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, uh, uh, short business stints.|sd
A|And it seems to me they are a pretty, pretty tough law and order state,|sv
A|but that's a,|%
A|but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.|sv
A|Just citing that, you know.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, unfortunately you have got a lot of the, uh,|%
B|some, well a lot of it can be contributed to the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close, to the border with Mexico,|sv

B|I've been trying to, you know, do that,|sd
B|and, and sometimes I just can't wait that long,|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I know.|aa
B|so I just  hang up. Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again.|sd
A|Well.|arp_nd
A|This is hilarious|sv
B|But I knew as soon as I heard your voice,|sd
B|I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy Kester|sd
A|Oh. Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?|qw
B|Well, let's see,|^h
B|I, um, gosh, I can't even think.|sd
B|I haven't read any,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think. Um, or something like that.|sd
A|Um.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it was, it was kind of,|%
B|I really didn't like it at all.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|It was, it was written back in the early eighties.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome of the, um,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing.|sd
A|Interesting.|ba
B|It was really an interesting,|aa
B|because I, I right away looked at when it was copyrighted. Because I could tell by the theme of almost when it was written. And, um, you know, a lot of hanky-panky,  going  on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.|sd
A|I was always,  just  more aware of her you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|for her young people, her books. *one utt?|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and she's more famous for that,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but she has been writing for adults also,|sd
A|I'll be darned.|ba
B|and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,  and  see what it was like.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It was very, um,|%
B|the style was very conversational.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|You know how that is,|qh
B|and um,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything printed, in print.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|she has,|sd
B|because I, I remember seeing a new book by her that was out,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|I'll be darned.|ba
B|So anyway,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|but that's the last thing I, I've read,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,  um,|%
A|Well, it's,|%
A|I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't,|sd

A|when I was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer|^h
B|Yeah.|b

A|I read a book that I have, should have read when I was probably in high school.|sd

A|JANE EYRE?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|it wasn't JANE EYRE.|sd
B|WUTHERING HEIGHTS?|qy

B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|by Jane Austen,|b^m
B|yes.|b
A|That's what it was,|sd
A|yes.|aa
B|Yes.|aa
A|And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist,|sd
A|and she really was good.|sv
A|I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,  intricately|sd
B|Uh-huh.|%
A|and, um, and, you know, I just,|%
A|but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,  or  had to write it, read it in high school or college,|sd
B|but I don't remember it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and I got her the, I got her someone,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.|sd
A|Oh, how interesting.|ba
B|You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so I got that for her,|sd
B|and she loved doing that.|sd
A|Oh, I'll bet,|ba
A|yeah.|b
B|But I remember that was the book.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,|sd
A|Right|b
A|I wouldn't be,  surprised,|ba
B|I'm just going to  have to put it, in the car sometimes and listen to it.|sd
A|yeah.|b
A|Sure.|ba
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|But, um,|%
A|Well, I read that,|sd
A|and then I'm trying to think, um,|^h
A|usually I try to, to find something long that,  I'm  going to,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|when|%
A|if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Oh, that's what I do too.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.|sd
A|I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.|sd
A|Actually, it's for school,|sd
A|but it's for, um,|%
A|there's a, a literary|%
A|well, not a literary journal,|%
A|it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.|sd
A|The first issue doesn't come out until next year,|sd
A|but, um,|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I'm doing  some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,|sd
B|Oh, how neat.|ba
A|and I've,|%
A|yeah,|aa
A|it's really neat because these are brand new books|sd
A|and I,  just got  a, I got a, this one,|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,  and  religion and all that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach,|sd
A|and it's a, a, a biography,  that is  really interesting,|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
B|Oh, that's fascinating.|ba
A|I mean, it, it's fascinating,|aa
A|it really is.|aa
B|Oh.|b
A|Um, but it's so long,|sd
A|I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing,|sd
A|but I think,  eventually  I'll go back to it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's,  it  was written,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,|sd
A|so it's a brand new book.|sd
B|Oh, it's a brand new book.|bf
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that, that would be wonderful  to read something like that.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|and he really, this man really  shed some light on, um, some,  aspects  of of Bach's genius and, and, and, you know, the, and more sociological things, you know, like the, the idea that, um, that music, to be a musician was as much, um, of a family occupation as anything.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, you know, that was it was families had just loads of musicians|sv
B|Yes.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and they just went from generation,  probably  to generation,  just with  these, with these all passing it from one to the other.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|that's right.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|uh-huh,|b
A|and, um,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|it was just really  interesting,|aa
A|if that's, you know, that's kind of what,|%
A|but I have to|%
A|not only am, am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board|sd
A|so,|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I don't  know if I want to take that responsibility or not,|sd
A|but But at least I,  can tell them  what I think,|sd
B|Wow, that's rough.|ba
B|That's real rough.|ba
A|so, um,  it's  real interesting.|sv
B|Yeah.  Because I think our, I think my alma mater, um, Gettysburg, I think they were just starting a magazine *sd that was similar to that.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do in small colleges,|sv
A|Yes|b
A|Yeah,|b
B|but,  um,|%
A|that it,|%
A|you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,  like  that,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|right,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|because  it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.|sv
A|That's one way,|%
A|it's really good public relations for small schools,|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I think  so|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing,|sd
A|and so I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of,|qw
A|Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,  in  the French and then has been translated into English by,  various  people.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And the translations are all so different from one another.|sd
B|All different.|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|So it's multiple translations of single works|sd
A|and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um,|sd
A|my work, is just kind of compiling,  all  that for him.|sd
B|Gosh.|ba
A|So,|%
B|That's great.|ba
A|It's real interesting.  There are days when  I would be prefer ,  really doing that|aa
B|Boy, you really lift me up to a different,|ba
B|I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,  cleaning  the stove|sd
B|and,|%
B|You know, I'm   I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire.|sd
B|That would be nice.|ba
A|I don't know if I've told you,|h
A|but, um, this is not on the subject,|sd
A|Jeri?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yes.|ny
A|We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.|sd
B|That's a rather, rather broad topic|sv
A|They're usually pretty broad anyway.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Where do you live?|qw
B|Uh, we live in Plano.|sd
A|Okay,|bk
A|so, that's a,|%
B|Uh, and where you are?|qw
A|I'm in Richardson,|sd
A|so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, uh, Maceo High School in Dallas.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Right,|b
B|that is so frightening.|ba
A|It is, you know,|aa
B|Uh, do you have children in school?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|mine are already in college now,|sd
A|so I don't have to,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.|sd
B|Well, I have,|%
B|my oldest is his first year in high school|sd
B|so we have all this to, to look forward to,|sd
B|and it is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.|sv
B|I mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,|sv
B|but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|And, uh, I really, you know,|%
B|they're coming down on the principal,|sd
B|but I really don't know what they can do.|sd
B|I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence|sv
B|and the kids having access to weapons and drugs|sv
B|and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.|sd
B|Well I don't either,|sd
B|but apparently they just really are.|sv
B|Uh I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get for for being in a, a large area.|sv
B|But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about having guns|sd
B|and uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.|sd
A|Oh, my heavens.|ba
B|And, I mean, it just scared me to death|sd
B|and, you know, they called the police|sd
B|and, and nothing happened,|sd
B|but my goodness you know, it, it could have easily.|sv
A|Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.|sv
B|Maybe so.|aa
A|You know, because I don't,|%
A|now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,|sv
A|and people don't do anything.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now.|sd
A|And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|But nobody, nobody did anything.|sd
B|I just can't imagine that.|sd
A|You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.|sd
A|Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I'm afraid, you know, if you,|%
A|I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,|sv
B|but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I,|%
A|I just, you know,|%
A|it's, it's really frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons|sv
A|and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Well I, I think you're right there.|aa
B|I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,|sv
B|but I think that's real dangerous|sv
B|and, uh, I don't know.|h
B|I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, you know|sd
B|and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|But, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just,|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|people just don't,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.|sv
B|Well, maybe this thing with with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to, to correct it.|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|it's, it really is, is frightening.|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|I, uh,|%
A|Let me ask you,|oo_co_cc
A|getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing,|sd
A|he didn't have a license for the gun, correct?|qy
B|I don't know.|no
B|I mean, I don't know the details.|sd
B|This was not a child that was on the team.|sd

B|but I'm not even,|%
A|Tell me what you like to do.|ad

A|Really,|b
A|that's great.|ba
A|Well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When they're skiing they're fearless,|sd
A|and they go off,|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank.|sd
A|I thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.|sd
B|Well, I haven't either, uh,|sd
B|I, I hate returning things.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's, you know, it's a game to her,|sd
B|but I, I do not like to do that|sd
B|I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time.|sd
B|And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we've had it for a while,|sd
B|but all of a sudden it just wasn't working,|sd
B|and it looks like there's a part missing from it.|sd
B|My husband opened it up and whatever,|sd
B|and of course we don't have the receipt any more,|sd
B|so we can't take it back|sd
A|Of course,|ba
A|uh-huh.|%
B|Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long|sv
A|Right|aa
B|uh,|%
A|right,|aa
A|just to get you by five years|sv
A|and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.|sv
B|Well, that's true,|aa
B|and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|And you usually get what you pay for.|sv
A|We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas,|sd
A|and they were like ten dollars,|sd
A|and we expected them to work nice for the little kids,|sd
A|and they didn't work worth anything|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we took those back,|sd
A|and that's about that|sd
A|all that were taken back in ages.|sd
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,|sv
B|and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
A|It's hard.|^2
B|We never could get it declared a lemon,|sd
B|and the car would go|sd
B|and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty|sd
B|and it would stop|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|and I,|%
B|there was just,|%
B|you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything,|sd
B|and they got it finally semifixed,|sd
B|but it was such a hassle|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|and it just pertained to that|qy^d
B|yeah,|ny
B|yeah|ny
B|it, it really is, uh,|sd
B|but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.|sd
A|I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy,|sd
A|it seems like,|sd
A|and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there,|sd
A|but, But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so.|%
B|Well, I think that's true,|aa
B|and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|my husband is really good at fixing things, too,|sd
A|so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor,|sd
A|and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, but, it was interesting to,|%
A|I don't know if they're making them better or not,|sd
A|I, it's hard to say.|sv
A|Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier,|sv
A|but I think the technology is better.|sv
B|I think technology is better,|aa
B|I'm, I'm not sure.|h
B|I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.|sv
A|About quality.|sv
B|I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|I, I,|%
B|everything is so automated, uh,|sv
B|and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something,|sv
A|so|%
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|that's that's true.|aa
A|so.|%
A|So, if we get what we what we deserve|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows|sd
B|and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.|sd
A|Well, you keep up with current events?|qy
B|Um, somewhat.|na
B|Yeah,|%
B|somewhat|na
A|Not,|%
B|not as well as I would like to probably|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|but that's the way it goes.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania.|qw
B|What?|br
A|Where in Pennsylvania?|qw
B|Um, State College,|sd
B|I go to Penn State.|sd
A|Oh, do you,|bk
A|well, great.|ba
B|Yep.|b
A|How's, uh,|%
A|well no,|ar
A|we're not supposed to talk about that.|sd
A|We're supposed to talk about current events.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly, uh.|aa
A|Well, I'm a current event junkie.|sd
A|So I, I watch, I try to watch the news,|sd
A|and I read the newspaper,|sd
A|and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.|sd
B|I see.|b
B|Well, what particularly are you interested in?|qw
A|Well, I just, pretty, uh, little, you know, about everything.|sd
A|And, not and then again not everything,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening.|sd
A|Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, other than that, uh, I just, you know,|sd
A|just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and know, feel like I know what's going on.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|But I always have been|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I stay up with it.|sd
A|But, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware of most of the current events. Uh, newspaper? T V news, or what?|qo
B|Um uh, well, some of both.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I read, I read the newspapers sometimes|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I watch C N N, that sort of thing occasionally|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's good.|ba
B|and I read magazines, and such.|sd
A|Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.|bf
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|I mean, not, not that badly anyway,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I am, I am interested in what's going on,|sd
B|and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yes,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, you've been there|bh
B|and, yeah.|ny
A|well, you would be interested in it then.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|Yeah, uh,|b
A|I follow it, you know,|sd
A|I don't just read everything about it,|sd
A|but I'm always aware of what's going on like that|sd
B|Yep,|b
A|and, uh, because it is, it's interesting|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I don't know,|h
A|I feel sorry for those people down there,|sd
A|they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know. I mean, through Papa Doc,|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|They've never really had a good leader,|sv
A|I mean he was a terrible tyrant|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think it's been better since he died,|sv
A|but it's still been bad|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, uh,|sd
A|I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.|sd
B|Oh, yeah?|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|he was pretty, pretty much a,|%
A|he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, It's, one of the reasons the U S wasn't so, you know, didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him, although he's probably better than a lot of them,|sv
B|I see.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, but then again, who, you know,|%
A|those people are so used to it|sv
A|I guess it's the only thing that works.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?|qo
A|I think it's pretty darned good,|sv
A|I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really do.|sd
A|Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme,|sv
A|the media does,|sv
A|but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,|sv
A|and I listen to the radio|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|so I, you hear so much,|sv
A|you get a little tired of it,|sv
A|but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe|sv
B|Yep.|b
A|but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really don't.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better,|ar
B|but I,  would agree that  it's pretty good.|aa
A|I  don't think so.|ar
A|I don't think our news could be better.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.|qh
B|Um.|b
A|I don't see anything that they could do.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I think that, um,|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|Well, you always want to think everything can be improved upon|sv
B|The, um,|%
B|Right.|aa
A|I understand what you're saying,|ba
B|Right,|aa
B|I think that,|sd
A|But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.|sv
B|Well, that may be so,|aa
B|yeah.|%
A|Uh nothing is perfect.|sv
B|I think that I'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into the how deep they dig into things and such.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's true,|aa
A|I understand what you're saying,|ba
A|and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,|sd
A|that's why we have C N N.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, well, I, I guess it's a subject I haven't thought too much about.|sd
A|Uh, I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools, uh, as much as, we're expecting too much out of them.|sv
B|Uh, that might be a lot to do with it.|aa
B|I know a lot of it here in my state,|sd
B|I'm from Mississippi,|sd
B|I'm not sure where you're from.|qw^d
A|Minnesota,  Wisconsin.|sd
B|Minnesota,|bk
B|okay.|bk
B|Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got to do with funding.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Problems with our educational system, a lot of it's due to money.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they're trying to spend money where we don't have it|sd
B|and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, it's, it is getting very expensive to run schools,|sv
A|so.|%
B|Well it is.|aa
A|They've got computers now that you got to train on.|sd
A|There's just  so much, uh, more and less money to do it with.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|That's true.|aa
B|And a lot of it, lot of it has to do with, uh, salaries too,  speaking  of money.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Cause if you can't pay the right people, you know, they're not to be able to do, they're not, not going to get the people that can do a good job.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|I, I, I guess that in, uh,|%
A|talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools, I, I think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids|sv
A|and, uh, I think it should go right back to the parents. If you don't train your kids right then|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|I feel the same way.|sd
B|A lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|And then when the kids get to school, they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids.|sv
B|I mean, they've so severely limited|sv
B|what disciplinary action you can do.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|I, I know when I, uh, was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|I mean they do that now|sv
A|and they could probably lose their job|sv
B|Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah|aa
B|I feel that's got a lot to do with it.|sv
B|People aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|Yeah|aa
A|It seems that'd be a subject that I, I don't have much to say on|sd
B|Really.|b
B|We, we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of, uh,|sd
B|our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education|sd
B|but he wasn't.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly.|sd
B|I know a lot, a lot of,|%
B|if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, unfortunately, there's not many places to get that money.|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|Then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different ,|sv
B|I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.|sd
B|That most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,|sv
B|they're teachers.|sv
B|And they may not know a lot about what they're teaching.|sv
B|Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses|sv
B|and they're trying to teach social studies.|sv
B|And they don't know a lot about that|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Where maybe a physics professor,|sv
B|he, my professor was a physics professor|sd
B|and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level.|sd
B|So therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.|sv
B|And that causes a lot of trouble.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I don't know,|h
A|maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent.|sv
A|I know in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like to have nice fancy schools.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with paying the right people to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Because, I mean, here in the town I went to high school,|sd
B|one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado.|sd
B|So when they rebuilt that school, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties|sd
B|and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through, they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones. Telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building|sd
B|and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I, I know, uh, where I came from. We didn't have a very, uh, rich community|sd
A|and, uh, high school that I went to was very old|sd
A|and, uh, as far as I know, it's still there.|sd
A|They've expanded on it|sd
A|but they've never built a new one|sd
A|and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better|sd
A|and I don't foresee them, uh, building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Exactly|aa
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Um, what type of magazines do you have?|qo
B|We take several at home.|sd
B|I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE,|sd

A|do you think|qy

B|Probably not.|ng
B|Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,|sd
B|and we just started looking around.|sd
B|I may have referred to a couple of them,|sd

A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh.|bk
B|We haven't been there before.|sd
A|Um, that sounds nice.|ba
B|Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one.|sd

B|what, what magazines do you have at home?|qo
A|Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,|sd
A|and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|sd
A|and then we have some church magazines,|sd
A|but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.|sd
A|I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,|sd
A|so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,|sd
A|but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,|sd
A|and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,|sd
A|and so, it's really a fun one.|sd
A|I like that.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
B|It's good to get use out of one.|sv
A|Uh-huh|aa
B|I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|%
B|I mean, I read it,|sd
B|but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for.|sd

A|Uh, fine furniture.|sd
B|Oh  do you?|bh

A|, but, we|%
A|is it on nineteen hundred?|fc
B|Uh-huh.|fc
B|Uh, let's see,|fc
B|I'm trying to think of the name.|fc
A|I know where fifty-six hundred south is.|fc
B|Uh, I don't right off.|fc
A|Is that Ben Franklin then ?|fc
B|Ben Franklin,|fc
B|okay.|fc
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|you want to start?|ad
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I might as well.|aa
B|Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, uh, this, this, the ozone layer, uh, uh, issue.|sd
B|Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons,|sd
B|and that, uh, rather bothers me that, uh, I was in, in effect, uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive,|sd
B|uh, they could be made, uh, you know, inexpensive and lots of it, uh,|sd
B|and in that, and its properties were great, uh, with, uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So.|%
A|Have they stopped that practice now?|qy
B|Well, course there's a, a tremendous number of refrigerators and excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, uh, utilizing freon twelve,|sd
B|and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems.|sv
B|But, uh, there's, you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going to be quite a while before we can, uh, undo this.|sd
B|Now, that could spawn several good industries and help, pull us out of this recession,|sv
B|but you got to have people that can make, you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion.|sv
B|So, so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Because as I say, there's a, there's a|sv
B|well, how many, uh, uh, families own a refrigerator,|qh
B|and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from and how many people, especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with air conditioning.|qh
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks,|sv
B|and, uh, the only reason I didn't, uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, uh, most of your, uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I mean,|%
B|so, uh, that's why I stayed in, stayed more towards, uh, uh,|sd
B|and that's a polluting type deal too, is the excessive, um, you know, uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, uh, like knocking on a really make, uh, make a mess.|sv
A|Um, yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark smoke,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but that, that particular bothers me.|sd
B|Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel that's, uh, those are carbon particles, and carbon dioxide and water vapor, uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because when you, when diesel is burned it's it,|%
B|you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine|sd
B|it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form because of, by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine, because diesel oil is, uh, is not very volatile. You know, where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily,|sd
B|and it's got,|%
B|well, you know, its latent heat is high,|sd
B|but it's slow burning at, at, uh, normal pressures.|sd
B|That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the, as the air is heated, you know, by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio|sd
A|Oh, I see.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so if the car sucks in, uh, fifty degrees,|%
A|Well, how do you feel about trial by jury?|qo
B|I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. Uh,|sd
A|In what way?|qw
B|In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than, uh, by evidence that's presented.|sd
B|I have, uh, very little regard for the law presently practiced.|sd
A|Oh, do, do you feel they are swayed more toward, are you talking about with criminal or civil suits?|qy
B|I was thinking primarily criminal cases.|sd
A|So, do you think that, I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry.|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|ny
B|That's a concern of mine.|sd
B|Uh, I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges. Uh, you know, doing the sentencing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|The other thing, the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know, that a judge can be|sv
A|I, I like the idea of juries of your peers uh, in that you, you, you get more personally more than one person making the, making a decision.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And second of all, you get a wide variety of background|sv
A|so that,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|my question I guess are they really your peers?|qh
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|I'd  agree with that.|aa
B|Uh  Uh, too often I think they are not|sv
A|That's definitely a problem.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, when you, when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if, if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I think that, uh, in such cases, uh, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, now I happen to know several judges|sd
B|and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury I would feel a little bit uneasy about|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but the other two I feel, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I guess that's what I am concerned with.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|I, guess I, I definitely agree with you,|aa
A|but the|%
A|well, what I don't like about, uh, sentence, the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the, the same crime gets unequal sentences.|sv
B|This is very true.|aa
A|I, uh, I think there is more of an ability of you know, you know for selecting a jury, two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea, uh, the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, I think, I think there would be a large variation in, in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|and you do see such uneven sentencing you know, evidence of it in the newspapers and such, I mean where, uh, it would appear the crimes were very similar|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but one individual got twenty-five years|sv
B|and the other one was sentenced to life.|sv
B|So,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh,|b
A|Of course a lot of that's also the ability of, of the defendant to, uh, get a good lawyer.|sv
B|Isn't that the truth|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There are times when is it, uh,|%
B|oh goodness, my mind has gone blank it's, uh, Othello.|sd
B|You know where he says kill all the lawyers|qy^d
B|Every now and then one is tempted to see what, what.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I agree|aa
B|But, I, it's taken me a long time to understand that, uh, lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of, you know, as, as novices tend to think that, uh, attorneys care about justice.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|I, I agree with it|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able to you know, of, of, letting, allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument.|sv
B|And they are very effective too.|sv
A|That the|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, even,|%
B|I have been involved, uh, just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, his attorneys gotten him off.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the city has dropped their charges against him because their, the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge.|sd
B|So I don't know|h
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, this is a little bit of the subject,|sv
A|but one, one thing that I really dislike, uh, also that's, that's new is the, uh, is that I have heard that there are federal sentences,|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|so, um,|%
A|yes|%
A|we do keep, uh, well we started out keeping a budget about two years, ago,|sd
A|we have a computer, here at the house,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our, our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month|sd
A|and then basically since then what I've done is, is keep track of it through the checkbook|sd
A|so that based on whatever we've got coming in, the check coming in, then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also|sd
A|because our house payment is once a month,|sd
A|that's our, our biggest, uh, expense|sd
A|so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each, with each paycheck, even thought it's really still there, so that I can keep, uh, uh, good balance, a running total, yeah through the month,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|A running total.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|What do you all do?|qo
B|Uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much we have coming in each month|sd
B|and then, uh, we've,|%
B|at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend.|sd
B|We sat made up different accounts like, you know,|sd
B|we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that|sd
B|and then we write down each, each time we spend something, we write down in a book|sd
B|and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we, you know|sd
B|we, we try to stay within a certain budget,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Is it, is it hard to keep track of it|qy
A|or does it work out pretty well?|qrr
B|Um, it takes some, it takes some dedication to do it,|sd
B|but it, it works out real well,|sd
B|so.|%
A|And, and you're staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good.|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|I stay I have to stay within it,|sd
B|so I, you know,|%
B|and then we have that, you know,|%
B|if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we call our slush fund or something|sd
B|and an unexpected comes up, then you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.|sv
A|You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month.|sd
A|That's a good choice,|ba
A|we've been trying, we're trying to, uh, do that this year.|sd
A|We've budgeted the money that we used to spend, we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year,|sd
A|we've taken that this year, and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards|sd
B|to someone else in the You've got paper under your table.|t3
A|and, uh, we have, uh, another loan with the bank,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so we hope by the end of this year, that by doing that we'll be free, and clear.|sd
B|To be out of that.|^2
B|Free.|b^m
B|Yeah,|b
B|the only thing we have, it to pay off is our, is a automobile loan and our house payment,|sd
B|and that's the only thing we ever,|sd
A|That's good to be in that kind of shape.|ba
B|We try to stay out of debt|sd
A|What are you all trying to do long term.|qw
B|Huh. Oh it's long term.|^h
B|We just,|%
B|he you know, his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that, that's all we,|sd
B|and you know, we just have our life insurance for right now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done the, uh, CODA account with T I where they, we put in so much a month,|sd
A|and then they, or so much a pay check and then they match it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's what we're doing.|sd
A|So that's, that's worked out pretty good|sd
A|and then, I used to work for T I|sd
A|and I have,|%
A|when I retired from there, or left, I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I R A|sd
A|and we had an out, we had an existing I R A|sd
A|so we have, both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure,|sd
A|to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we're  also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|when ever we get enough saved  we stick it in a C D for a while|sd
B|and, then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired|sd
B|and then so,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see, we had one of the financial companies, um,|sd
A|uh, John Hancock company came out|sd
A|and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we were what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house, um, special thing, buying land and building our own house|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at, and then gave us a good idea back, you know, some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals, and, or not, and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|or not,|^2
B|yeah.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That sounds interesting,|ba
B|we've never done|sd
B|we have,|%
B|you know, just our, our life insurance guy has come out, you know,|sd
B|and he's set up, uh, you know, determined how much we need to, you know, we need if something were to happen.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is, since I'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh, what we would need if something happened to my husband, or what he would need if something happened to me,|sd
A|that's a, a big thing to think about.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah, you know,|aa
B|if, I would sell the, you know,|%

B|I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax.|sv
B|I mean, probably would have paid the same amount|sv
B|but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|True.|ba

B|Yes,|b
B|that's, that's sad.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,  finish  the job while we were in there.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides.|sd
B|I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.|sv
B|I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away.|sv
A|Seems to have helped him though,  popularity wise.|sv
B|Yeah, it, it,  it did a lot.|aa
B|He did a real good job I believe.|sv

B|It did?|bh
A|We may get some more tonight.|sd
B|Oh, well. We, we've just got slight chances of rain.|sd

B|The public school systems, well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|The first direction that I can see, or I wish, I would love to see them go with.|sv
B|Kids learn at different rates|sv
B|and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together.|sv
B|You'd learn at this rate|^q
B|and that's the only way it's going to happen.|^q
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's true|aa
B|You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it,|sv
B|and the the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject, you've bored them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|that's, that's very true.|aa
A|Um, I guess I can relate to that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that.|sd
A|Uh, one picks up real quick|sd
A|and the other one doesn't.|sd
A|And you're right, they do get bored, uh, really fast, if they already know what you're talking about.|aa
A|What do you propose that they do?|qo
A|What, what is your suggestions?|qw
B|The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, uh, the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Out of each child.|b
B|Out of each child.|b^m
A|Each individual child.|b
B|Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff.|sv
B|Other kids are going to be really into math,|sv
B|some are really going to be heavy into reading.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's,|%
B|But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in?|qh
B|Because if he's interested, he's going to study it,|sv
B|and he's going to learn it,|sv
B|and he's going to remember it.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
A|The only, I think the only thing that they would argue about that, is that, you know, every child needs to learn every subject.|sv
A|I mean, that's, that might be the only thing.|sv
A|But, I mean, I, I definitely agree with you. Uh,|aa
B|They need exposure to every subject.|sv
B|They don't need to be masters of it,|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|That's true. Uh,|aa
B|Everything I learned about ancient Rome has not helped me anywhere in, my adult life.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|I definitely agree.|aa
A|There's no doubt about that.|aa
A|I, uh, I, I mean, I can relate to that because I'm, I'm going to college right now,|sd
A|and I feel like, I mean, I'm taking this history class.|sd
A|And, I mean, it's so boring,|sd
A|and I just hate it.|sd
A|And I think, why do they make us take this stuff?|sd
A|I mean, what does this have to do with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know?|qh
B|What, what type of history class is it that you're having to take?|qw
A|Uh, American History.|sd
A|We have to take, um, like this is like early seventeen hundreds through, I don't know, I think like mid eighteen hundreds.|sd
A|And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up, to basically present.|sd
B|Well, the early ones they could actually combine two, two, levels of it, the one from seventeen hundred til say, the end of the Civil War.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Combine that into one. And then from eighteen sixty-five to present,|sv
B|and make that your second step because, To a point, to a point the bottom, you know, the early parts of it, you're giving the foundations of the nation|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's, well that's, basically what they're doing.|sd
B|and, but even then they're skimming over,|sv
B|they're very, almost trivial with it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|oh, yes.|aa
A|Definitely,|aa
A|I agree.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|there's,|%
B|You know, I mean, if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, I mean, there's, they make all these people out to be, oh,|sv
B|they were great men,|sv
B|and they're the father of the country and all this.|sv
B|He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else.|sv
B|If not more.|sv
B|The man was not a saint.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's true,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Any way, this, this, um, school system thing,|%
A|I, I tell you, I saw something on the news, oh, I don't know, maybe two weeks ago.|sd
A|And they were talking about,|sd
A|I don't know where you're from,|qw^d
A|but I'm from the Dallas area.|sd
A|And they were talking about the Plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, I mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. They took these students and put them basically in a closet. With no windows.|sd
A|They had, a, a table, or not a table, but a desk in this closet,|sd
A|and they had to sit in there by themselves.|sd
A|Well, parents were getting really angry about this, because they said, Why is my child being put in this closet.|sd
A|Well, how is that helping my child, you know.|^q
A|And, uh, the, the thing, you know,|%
A|they said, Well, we're giving them isolation time|sd
A|and this helps them to think.|^q
A|But a lot of kids,|%
A|I mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify him, you know|sv
A|and,|%
B|If, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded?|qh
A|Uh, that's true.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
A|But, no,|%
A|I mean, they were, uh, I mean,|%
A|I definitely agree with parents.|sd
A|I think that is a very wrong way to handle, uh, disciplining a child.|sv
A|Putting them in, I mean, they were, they were they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms.|sd
A|They didn't call them closets.|sd
A|But they showed these rooms on, uh, you know, on the news|sd
A|and, I mean, they looked like a closet to me. You know, with a desk in it, a real small.|sd
A|But they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms.|sd
A|I said, now what good does I mean, how is this helping?|sd
A|I mean, either way. You know, I, I definitely had to disagree with that.|sd
A|I think that is, that's not the way to handle a child, you know, discipline a child by putting him in a closet|sv
B|the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that the public school system I want to see changed too.|sd
B|When I was brought up, if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough, you were going to get spanked.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Well, then the extreme came in,|sv
B|and now we can no longer, spank them,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|so we now isolate them.|sv
A|Yep.|b
A|Uh|b
B|Okay,|b
B|we've swung the pendulum both ways.|sv
B|Let's find a middle ground.|sv
B|Instead of, there has to be some sort of discipline,|sv
B|and there has to be some sort of punishment. Short of physically isolating the child, and short of physically hitting the child.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Well,|%
B|Let's put him into a situation where, okay, you crossed the line, you broke the rule, you're going to have to pay for it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But, it's going to tax you physically.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I don't,|%
B|Have I mean, instead have them pick up around the school yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school Do something to beautify the school property.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|But you cut, you know,|%
B|the, the kid's having to give up his, quote, play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong.|sv
A|Well,|%
B|But he's seeing something constructive come out of it.|sv
A|um, I have to,|%
A|I think one of the positive things, I mean, one of the things that can come out of, uh, is not just discipline, okay?|sv
A|But, okay,|%
A|for instance, one of the things they do at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call, uh, caught being good slips.|sd
A|And when the kids are in halls and stuff, and if they're being really good, I mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on.|sd
A|They're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed to,|sd
A|they get one of these caught being good slips.|sd
A|And then, when they collect them at the end of each week, they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store,|sd
A|and then they get to spend these like money.|sd
A|Well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids, because they're going to be good and try and earn those things, you know, to get the positive part of it.|sv
A|I mean, they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked.|sv
A|So, they're definitely going to work towards being good, you know, rather than trying to act up and be bad, you know.|sv
B|I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself.|sv
B|We've been too long, there's been too much negative reinforcement.|sv
B|How much, like, the caught being good slips.|%
B|How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street?|qh
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well that's true. I think, I think, really though,|aa
A|I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked.|sd
A|But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also.|sd
A|And it really helps.|sd
A|And I mean, they, they don't get spanked very often,|sd
A|but they, they do when they deserve it, you know.|sd
A|But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.|sv
A|I mean, I, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child.|sd
A|But, you know, that's just my personal opinion,|sd
A|and that's not going to,|%
A|I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.|sv
A|They are never going to let a, a teacher spank a child again.|sv
A|But I don't think,|%
A|I mean, some kids don't get don't get spanked at home|sv
A|and some kids need to be spanked at home.|sv
A|I mean, don't you think?|qy
B|I, most wholeheartedly agree.|na
A|But I don't know.|h
B|I mean, there's a point of over kill,|sv
B|but somewhere in, you've got to find an even line.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|Well, there's so many parents that say, you can deal with a child without spanking them. Which is true, you can.|sv
A|But there are times when a child needs to be spanked.|sv
A|I mean, they do things that they need that.|sv
B|Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked.|sv
A|Right. ends with no further|b
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Um, I guess what, I guess my task.|sd
A|I usually ride my bike.|sd
A|I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.|sd
A|And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.|sd
A|The stationary bike is, is so, uh,  boring.|sv
B|Boring.|^2
A|But I have head phones,|sd
A|and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room|sd
A|so I either watch T V, or we have a fish tank,|sd
A|so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.|sd
A|If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.|sd
A|It kind of takes the time away|sd
A|and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.|sd
A|But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,|sd
A|and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.|sd
A|But it's definitely a task.|sd
B|You think so?|bh
A|I can't say that I really enjoy it.|sd
A|I wish that I did enjoy it more,|sd
A|but I do it because I have to not because I want to|sd
B|I bought a stationary bike,|sd
B|but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|And I haven't figured how to get that soft,|sd
B|and I tried even tying a pillow to it.|sd
B|But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.|sd

A|Really?|bh
B|I just love it.|sd
A|So is it just women that go there?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|It's totally women.|sd
A|See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.|sd
A|Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.|sd
A|You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home|sd
A|and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.|sd
A|I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,|sd
A|but I still don't like other people watching me.|sd
B|I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess. Uh, feel that, okay fine, if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,|sd
B|so there's no big deal all the way around,|sv
B|but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.|sv

A|Huh.|b
B|They have two types of water aerobics.|sd
B|They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.|sd
A|I've heard that that's really good for you to do.|sd
B|It pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it is like double strenuous.|sd
B|But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.|sd
B|Because you're pushing it yourself.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So you're doing it yourself.|sd
A|So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?|qy
B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|When you're in the water?|qy
B|Huh-uh.|nn
B|The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.|sd

A|Oh, wow.|ba
A|Well, that's funny,|ba
A|I never would have thought of that.|sd

A|okay.|bk
B|no big deal one way or the other.|sv

A|You know, it, it,|%
A|I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.|sd

B|Well,|%
A|But,|%
B|When I was working up at, uh, The Summit, here in Plano, I'd leave there,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Oh, that's,|%
B|so I was there by four thirty, every night.|sd
B|And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,|sd
B|but,  I enjoyed it  higher.|sd
A|Did you ever,|%
A|Well, I'm sorry|fa
B|That's okay.|bd
A|Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?|qy

A|Oh,  okay.|bk
B|It's like I can walk,|sd

A|Um.|b
B|Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,|sd
B|it will bother me.|sd
A|Then that would,|sv
A|yeah.|%
B|it will bother me.|aa
A|I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?|qy
B|Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.|arp_nd
B|I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.|sd
B|She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.|sd
B|She says in fact you get more.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I like water.|sd
B|I'm not scared of it.|sd
B|But I couldn't,|sd
B|I guess I could swim across the pool,|sd
B|but I'm no swimmer per se.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I found that this worked really well.|sd
B|And I came out of there|sd
B|and I saw my stomach going down well.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds. Just by watching what I ate.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.|sd
A|What if you're already on one?|qw
A|I mean,|%
B|What?|qw
B|A diet?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?|qy
B|Oh, no,|nn
B|they have nothing to do with that.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.|sd
B|And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.|sd
B|And they go over all your health and all your history,|sd
B|and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.|sd
B|So it became part of the package,|sd
B|so I went through it.|sd
B|It worked out well.|sd
A|But they have packages  where they just offer the exercise program.|qy^d
A|Is that what you're saying?|qy
B|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.|sd
A|I see,|bk
A|okay.|bk
B|I just  went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,|sd
B|so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there, after all this time.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So it's like when I got laid off,|sd
B|I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.|sd

A|Oh|b
B|And I love it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That would be really nice|sv
B|Because I have I have never,|%
B|let me reword that,|oo_co_cc
B|I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's,|%
B|I knew I was pushing too far.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|That's, you  know,|%
A|I wanted,  I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike,|sd
B|But most of  the others to me are very dull.|sv
A|but I got talked into the bike instead.|sd
A|And I don't know,|h
A|I really wanted a stepper.|sd

A|Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?|qw
B|Um, I get bored very easily.|sd
B|Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.|sv
B|Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.|sd
A|Huh.|b

B|you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so, to what your gear is.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I,|%
B|it would depend upon which one you want.|sd
B|I think now that I've had the bicycle,|sd
B|I would go to the stepper.|sd
B|But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.|sd

A|Oh, really?|bh
A|Um.|b

A|Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp,  okay?|sd
B|Oh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And I have, uh, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that I cook.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea,|sd
A|and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.|sd
B|Oh, it sounds fantastic.|ba
A|Yes.|aa
A|And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, uh, like your rice steamer,  your rice  cooker.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,|ad
A|and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Now, you can either use, you know, the kind that comes in the little can|ad
A|or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.|ad
B|Is it cayenne pepper, you mean?|qy
A|Cayenne?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|And you put a little bit of that over it.|ad
A|Now if you use the dried kind? Then you would only use two of them.|ad
B|Yes.|b
A|And you put that in there,|ad
A|and then you pour two bottles of beer over it.|ad
B|And how much shrimp would you use?|qw
A|Two pounds.|sd
B|Two pounds,|b^m
B|okay.|bk
A|That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you pour the beer over the top of it,|ad
A|and you cover it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,  and  the shrimp turn pink.|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then you remove it,|ad
A|and you put it on a platter.|ad
A|And then you serve it with melted butter.|ad
A|And, uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And they can just dip it,|sd
A|and they shell it as they eat it.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|But, uh, then the uh, the cauliflower, you,  cook  that in the microwave.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what you do is, you just, uh, wash it,|ad
A|and you core it. And in a like a, oh, what do you call it? Like Pyrex or something like that, kind of bowl that would go in the microwave.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|A glass dish.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And you, uh, put about two tablespoons of, uh, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt.|ad
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then you just set your cauliflower in there,|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  then you cook it for seven minutes on high.|ad
A|And you rotate it one time.|ad
B|And it's, are you cooking the whole head at one time?|qy
A|Uh-huh. Uh, when you core it, you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off.|ny
B|Okay.|bk
B|I see.|aa
A|And, uh, you just set it in there,|ad
A|and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,|ad
A|and you turn it one time.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,|sd
A|and I mix it all together.|sd
A|And I shred up some just regular white cheese.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it,|ad
A|and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.|ad
A|And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,  just  mainly to melt the cheese and everything, and let all the seasoning melt into it.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,  it's  done.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, that sounds fantastic.|ba
A|It is good.|sd
A|But it, it looks,|%
A|I mean, what you can do then, see is, like what I usually do is, I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle,|sd
A|and then I put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it,  you know,  on my platter.|sd
B|Um, um.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that.|sd
A|And, you know, you have all the different seasonings and stuff,|sd
A|and then I just fix little individual cups for them.|sd
A|And they have the,  garlic  bread,|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|and it makes it a real nice looking,  you know.|sd
B|And it's  not much work.|sv
A|Huh-uh,|aa

B|That sounds,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
A|You look like you went to a whole bunch,|sd

B|mine had been a, a, a|sd

B|a mill rat had been bought|sd

A|Whoops|ba
B|And they had misclassed the sex of back there|sd

B|yeah,|%
B|we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.|sd

A|I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,|sd

A|I think was the last time I was up, up there and at Center Park.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, so,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's not too far from were we live,|sd

A|No,|nn
A|they're just mutts,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|yeah,|b
A|my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met.|sd
A|Um, she's had them for a couple years.|sd
A|And um, you know, they're really cute,|sd
A|they're, they're sisters,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|one of them is a lot bigger than the other one|sd
A|and, she pushes the other one away from the food.|sd
A|Apparently I don't know all the details|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|the topic was, should the United States adopt the metric system, and if so, should, uh.|sd
B|How should they do it?|qw
B|Why didn't it work last time?|qw
A|And why didn't it work last time?|b^m
B|Well, I'm all for it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I, I am too.|sd
A|I wish, uh, it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that, you know, trying to convert over,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I guess, what'd they try, they tried what'd the call it, soft conversion and hard conversion|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they tried the,|%
A|one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard|sd
A|and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|direct conversion.|sd
A|I, I don't know. Uh.|h
B|I think they just ought to, you know, start, uh, just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever, you know, start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,|sv
B|and you know, people if they have to are going to learn to think that way.|sv
A|Well don't most of them, doesn't just about everything now have both metric and English.|qy^d
B|They do,|na
B|but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages, you know.|sv
B|You buy a quart of milk,|sv
B|and sure it has, has the metric equivalent written on there,|sv
B|but it still a quart.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|But if they started putting it in liters, liter of oil, and you know, liters of gasoline, people are going to learn to think in metric.|sv
B|As long as you can still buy a product in the English units, that's how you're going to think of it.|sv
A|I kind of remember back when gas prices started up, you know, pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range,|sd
A|somebody had, uh,|sd
A|I believe it was Exxon|sd
B|It figures.|ba
A|we were living in Lubbock at the time,|sd
A|they started marketing it in liters,|sd
A|and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter.|sd
A|So they could put this sign out front that said, you know, thirty-nine cents a liter.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And nobody had any idea what a liter was,|sd
A|so, uh.|%
B|That, that's the problem.|ba
A|When we finally out that liters was about a quart, there's about four liters in a gallon|sd
A|so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|It's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|when I was growing up, we were talking metric system in school. I mean, not, not at first,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh.|b
B|I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is, anyway.|sv
B|A liter's about a quart.|sd
A|The, uh, I think maybe there's where the problem came in, you know.|sv
A|We've tried to, instead of learning,|sv
A|it's kind of like learning a language, you know,|sv
A|when you learn one from the other, you always end up in this conversion thing all the time.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you,|%
A|it's almost like, uh,|%
A|course this country isn't a dictatorship,|sv
A|but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught talking in the English, you know, will be shot or something like that, you know.|sv
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, thing is, it's a global, global market place these days,|sv
B|and, you know, we're like, what, one of two backwards countries in the world, as far as,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I read that, what Uganda and,|sd
B|Something.|^2
B|I don't remember what the other one is|sd
B|but,|%
A|There's one or two others that just,|%
B|It's just time I think for, for us to go over.|sv
B|Because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, you know,|h
B|I work for T I,|sd
B|we're all around the world,|sd
B|you have to perform this conversion anyway.|sv
A|Yeah, uh, I, Yeah, I do, too.|sd
B|And.|%
A|And one of the things that we've run into a problem,|%
A|course you're familiar with the T I drawing, well, with any drawing system you end up with, you end up with things in inches in parts of inches, you know, half, fourth, you know, this sort of thing.|qy^d
B|Right.|na
B|Mils and microns.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|And then you end up with a decimal, where you start getting into mils, and that sort of thing.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And then some of them are done in, you know, purely metric.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns|sd
B|and ours were in mils.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it got to, you know,|sd
B|somewhere down the line they went standardized,|sd
B|they went microns,|sd
B|but, uh, you just, you know, you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Oh, I can imagine.|ba
B|So.|%
A|The, uh, the one that, uh, uh,|%
A|have you ever lived in a country where they use metric.|qy
B|No.|nn
A|I was with T I in El Salvador for a while,|sd
A|and I had to get used to, you know, purely metric system down there, because they didn't understand anything else.|sd
A|You know, if you start talking about miles, they'd look at you like, what.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I had a little bit of experience with it,|sd
A|and also I noticed in Canada they, uh, you drop a quarter, fifty cents, whatever, in a coke machine up there,|sd
A|and you get this funny looking coke, you know,|sd
A|it's in a can that's that's taller but not as big around.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I guess that's some|%
B|About half a liter.|qy^d
A|it's not a liter,|aa
A|it's like a half a liter or something like that.|aa
A|It's a strange looking can.|sd
A|But my daughter in law's from Panama,|sd
A|and she has, they have had Americans down there for so long, you know, that they're kind of into both systems,|sv
A|but, uh, she gets real confused on distances|sd
A|and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I would have more problem more problem with the temperature, except that, you know, working in engineering, we do everything in Centigrade, or Celsius.|sd
A|Well, I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,|sd
A|if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,|sv
A|and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,|sv
A|if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,|sv
B|It's getting warm, right.|aa
A|if it's more than  thirty it's just hotter than all get out.|sv
A|So, but, uh. The big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is.|sv
A|You know, you don't get all the little differences|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's about.|%
A|you know, the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much,|sd
A|but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is, quite a bit.|sd
B|Is about twice as much, what it works out to.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|five|sd
B|One point eight times as many points.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|something like that.|aa
B|Yeah,|%
B|so. I, I think as long as people have a choice, they're going to stick with the American way.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And until we have to, have to learn to think that way, we won't.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Though we call it the English system,|sd
A|but I'm not sure what they do in England now.|sd
A|They're, they're on metric, aren't they?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|for the most part, I think so.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|except they've got a,|%
A|now, okay, we run into some problems once,|sd
A|I remember, they've got a nut and bolts system called Wentworth.|sd
A|And this thing was, was even different than, you know, S A E standards and stuff.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Right.|b
A|This, this,|%
A|okay,|%
A|my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years quite a few years back,|sd
A|and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine, you know,|sd
A|it was Austin motors engine and running gear.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And the body was built by Nash,|sd
A|or who, you know,|%
A|that was even before American Motors,|sd
A|but Nash, essentially, in the U S somewhere.|sd
A|And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and, uh, S A E.|sd
A|He ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing.|sd
B|He just get one more .|%
A|Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same,|sd
A|but the threads were different,|sd
A|and, uh it was a total mess.|sd
B|Oh, that would be a mess.|ba
A|And on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old.|sd
A|Part of it's built in Canada.|sd
A|Matter of fact, the thing is, I always say it's built off shore, you know, because it was assembled in Canada.|sd
A|The only thing that was in it was built in the U S was the, uh, differential,|sd
A|and it was built in Buffalo, New York.|sd
A|But it's got the hardest combination of, uh, metric|sd
A|and, most of the body parts seem to be metric,|sd
A|and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E,|sd
A|so. It's just crazy.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|It just gets bad,|sv
B|now, you got to, you got to have one, and not mix them up.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because you're never going to get to one, one system if you still got a, got a mix.|sv
B|And of course, here that, that would involve changing road signs all across the country, you know, miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and the whole nine yards.|sv
B|Kind of hard to do gradually.|sv
A|I thought maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit, because what is it fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred, uh, a hundred kilometers,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you know|%
B|Hell, you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour.|sv
A|yeah,|aa
A|you'd have,|sv
A|hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five,|sv
A|you'd have people going, you're right, a hundred miles an hour.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, so. I don't know,|h
A|I'd kind of,|%
A|and the other thing, too, is, you know, between here and El Paso's, what, five hundred miles,|sd
A|but it's almost eight hundred kilometers, you know.|sd
A|That'd sure seems like a long way.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but they'd need, they'd seem to be ticking off faster, too.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess that's it.|aa
B|Every road sign you come to, is like, well I don't know it that far.|sv
A|Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,|sd
A|they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think they,|%
B|you got the problem with all your cars are still,|sv
B|yeah,|%
B|you still got cars on the road that don't have both.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|At that time, anyway, that was still when things were,|sv
B|the metric system was still not,|sv
A|Not all that common.|^2
B|You know, now cars, they have both.|sv
B|Sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way.|sv
A|I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was, was in Panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour|sd
A|and some are in kilometers.|sd
A|And you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So where was your last vacation?|qw
B|Uh, actually my last vacation was in Connecticut.|sd
B|Uh, we went home to visit family.|sd
B|Before that we were in Hawaii.|sd
A|Oh, I, I'd, well actually I did visit Hawaii once|sd
A|but I never made it off of Oahu, which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|It wasn't actually.|ar
B|It,|%
B|when we were in Oahu, uh, I couldn't wait to get off|sd
B|We, we took a cruise|sd
B|and we went to four different islands|sd
B|and it was a really nice,|sd
B|Kauai was nice and Maui was nice.|sd
B|We had, we had a great time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We were there for ten days.|sd
A|Oh that's,|%
A|wow.|ba
A|Yeah.|%
B|Yeah,|b^m
B|yes.|b
B|So where have you been?|qw
A|Oh I've I've been lots of places.|sd
A|My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess|sd
A|we, that one would count ,|%
B|Morocco.|b
B|Really.|b
A|Uh, that was about a year and a half ago,|sd
A|and,|%
B|No kidding.|ba
B|what, what, did you just decide to go there|qy
B|or,|%
A|Uh, well my husband is French|arp_nd
A|and we were living in France at the time|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa|sd
A|and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet.|sd
A|And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go|sd
A|and they speak French|sd
A|and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.|sd
A|And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.|sv
A|We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed.|sv
A|We do a lot of traveling around.|sd
A|We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.|sd
B|Was it hot?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|in fact some of the days we froze.|sd
A|It was,|%
B|Really?|bh
A|well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I was born in Saudi Arabia|sd
B|and, uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around you know, in, in Europe and whatnot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I was very young|sd
B|so I don't remember that|sd
B|and, I was three when we moved back here.|sd
A|At at, excuse me, at what age did you,|qw
A|Oh, that's too bad|ba
A|because,|%
B|So I don't remember|sd
B|but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and that I was when I was a baby|sd
B|but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful|sv
B|because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|It was a very interesting vacation.|sd
A|The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you, there were some places, where people,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had nothing taken because we knew|sd
A|and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|But,|%
B|We, we found that in Jamaica.|sd
B|It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they, they were so destitute|sd
B|and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism|sd
B|and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things|sd
B|and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.|sd
A|The, the worst place was in Marrakech|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad|sd
A|and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities|sd
A|and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it doesn't matter who it is|sd
A|and they keep everyone else away from you.|sd
B|Oh really.|b
A|And it's worth it|sv
A|and it's like ten dollars a day or something|sd
A|and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you|sv
B|Really.|b
A|and you feel stupid doing that|sv

A|and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,|sd
B|Now when was that, when were you there?|qw
A|Um, August, eighty-eight.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, actually, after there I went to um, Hawaii,|sd
A|a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings|sd

B|Didn't have shrimp there huh|qy
A|I don't think so.|ng
B|I remember food|sd
A|Oh, I like that too.|sd
A|But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,|sd
A|it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Oh you're adventurous.|ba
B|You went by yourself.|qy^d

B|Really.|b
A|And I was by myself in China too.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh wow.|ba
A|China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.|sd
A|But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Was it very expensive?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit,|sd
A|no|ar
A|maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less,|sd
A|I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare|sd
A|and,  but this is from Hong Kong,|sd
B|You're kidding!|ba
B|No kidding!|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because I was already in Hong Kong|sd
A|and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there|sd
A|and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu|sd
A|and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it.|sd
A|It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai.|sd
A|It's just a train ride.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that,|%
A|I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things.|sd
A|It was really,|%
B|All for a thousand dollars?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Wow!|ba
B|That really surprises me.|sd
A|Around a thousand.|sd
B|I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive,  aren't they?|qy
A|Oh, Japan's  ridiculous.|na
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels|sd
A|but I stayed in,|%
A|they were all completely clean,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, they were newly built|sd
A|and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Wow.|ba
A|Uh, but|%
A|yeah,|%
A|that was,|%
A|I highly recommend that way to go.|sd
A|If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman,|sd
A|her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston|sd
B|Oh really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China|sd
A|and she just gave me this woman's name to contact|sd
A|and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then,|%
A|Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place|sd
A|and, uh, I'm, uh, not for gun control, in the strictest sense of the, uh, word.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I have quite a collection myself|sd
B|and, you know, I'm a good hunter|sd
B|and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.|sd
B|Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes|sd
B|and, you know, I don't want to see them ban guns completely|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either|sd
B|so,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well I, I feel that its, uh,|sv
A|I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns,|sd
A|only outlaws will have guns then.|sd
B|I believe that.|ba
A|And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to, commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gum, a a gun, a knife, a, a rock, a stick, whatever it is, to commit a crime with,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh,|sv
A|we can handle it|sv
A|but there's an element that can't.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons|sv
B|because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them.|sv
A|They have got them outgunned.|sv
B|You know. Yeah.|aa
B|So.|%
A|There was a  an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|It had, held like a fifteen shot clip, which, uh, would be able, they would be able to put down anything that came at them,|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that would be,|%
A|but you  figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh, a thirty-eight, uh,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's,|%
A|Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.|sv
B|No|aa
B|it's sure not.|aa
B|Huh-uh.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time|sd
A|and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control|sd
A|but it was, you had to register as a gun owner,|sd
A|you didn't have to list your guns,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but you had to have this card,|sd
A|it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and that was the first, uh,|sd
A|this was twenty years ago.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit  in that respect.|sd
B|See in California they,  In California they make you register when you buy ammunition.|sd
A|Pardon?|br
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You have to sign a, you know,|sd
B|they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff, before you can buy any big ammunition. Especially for handguns,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|now rifles aren't too bad,|sv
B|but, you know, any kind of handgun at all, if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it, or sign up for it,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so.|%
A|We lived in Tennessee for awhile|sd
A|and I bought a pistol there|sd
A|and there was a fifteen day waiting period.|sd
A|You had to fill out an application and, go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing.|sd
B|Gee.|ba
B|Gee, that's not a bad idea.|ba
A|No,|aa
A|I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh, can make a difference|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|it is.|aa
A|So there's,  I don't,  think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because,|sv
B|No.|b
B|the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course,|sv
B|I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway,|sd
B|I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I'm,|%
B|So.|%
A|We, we're getting into capital punishment now|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, you know.|%
A|But I, I agree with you there that, uh,|aa
B|It would definitely be gun control|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands|sd
A|but, the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element.|sv
B|Myself.|%
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Well and they're actually a necessity in life,  you know.|sv
A|Oh yes.|aa
B|They're not, you know,|ar
B|not everybody needs a gun|ar
B|but sooner or later I need one.|sd
B|You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know,|sd
B|I'm never had to protect my life or,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street|sd
B|so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects ,|sd
A|You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh, or your pocket all the time.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|aa
A|Yeah.|%
B|No.|aa
B|So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't,|sd
B|and I enjoyed my guns.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I have a good time with them|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well I know what, uh,|%
A|I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun.|sd
A|My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but we have several guns around the house|sd
A|one of these days my grandkids probably.|sv
B|Probably.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
A|But I think it's, uh,|%
A|you got to have, have the|sv
A|living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot|sv
A|but, uh, still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that when, it's not like on T V when someone gets shot, uh, they get back up.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|huh-uh.|aa
A|If someone gets shot with a, real gun they don't get back up.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I had to explain that to my,|sd
B|I've got a six year old now|sd
B|and he, you know,|%
B|I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well|sd
B|they understand now.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know I've taken time to teach them|sd
B|and now the young boy wants to know|sd
B|and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows|sd
B|and I took it away from him,|sd
B|I said now, you know, so he's learning the hard way|sd
B|but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something|sd
B|so,|%
A|I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me.|sd
A|This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,|sd
A|this was a gentleman in his sixties,|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two, and taught me how to shoot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We went squirrel hunting|sd
A|and, and, uh, he taught me how to shoot, uh, a old single shot twenty-two|sd
B|All right.|b
A|and, I was probably about twelve at the time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I thought that was the neatest thing|sd
A|and, of course Uncle Sam took me out, took me hunting with him|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and he let me shoot and showed me how.|sd
B|All right.|b
B|I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Well that's about all I,|sd
A|we agreed pretty well on this I think.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa

A|Uh, no, uh, um,|nn
A|no particular school.|nn
A|Uh, I think that's really a decision  that,|sv
B|That  you are going to let them make.|qy^d
A|They,|%
A|well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are, they are wanting to do.|arp_nd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and, You know what, not only what you can afford, but what, what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Where did you go to school?|qw
A|Uh, University of Mississippi.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Was that local or, uh,|qy
A|Uh, well, it was, well, it was within the state.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|But I, I mean, so what's, ,|%
A|What's the criterion for choosing to go there?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, well, at the time, I was, uh, thinking of going pre med|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med uh, curriculum for the, uh, state institutions.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was choice between there and, uh, a private college that, uh, was a bit more expensive.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|At the time, we really could not afford it|sd
A|so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me.|sd

A|It,|%
A|uh, I enjoyed it.|sd
B|So you, did you commute everyday then|qy
B|or,|%
A|No.|nn

A|No,|nn
A|no,|nn
A|it was a six hour drive.|sd
B|Oh, okay,|bk
B|when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour|sd
B|or,|%
A|I was, uh, it was like another world.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Basically, it was a, no it was a,|sd
A|did not get home that often, you know,|sd
A|and at that age it's, uh, it's kind of, kind of difficult sometimes.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b

B|So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|b^m
B|Uh, see I did not get my degree until later on,|sd
B|so I just finished mine a couple of years ago.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier|sv
B|but,|%
A|Uh, that's true.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that, that's like, you know, when I went on to get my, my master's I, uh, basically was, you know, it was where I was at the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|and I was trying to work.|sd
A|But, uh, so when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I see.|b
B|Well, let's see|^h
B|I, have not you know,|%
B|there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said.|aa
B|Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that,|sv
B|so I, I have not really made up my mind, you know, whether to encourage them to go different places|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|or,|%
A|One day I would like to, uh, you know, the, uh,|sd
A|I, I like the school where I went.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Or the school where I got my master's at, which, which was a different school.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I liked it almost as well.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, but, uh, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I, you know, think that's|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|If they want to, that's fine, but otherwise not. Although I uh, would get quite a break on, on tuition|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Um, because you went there.|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students who children of alumnae.|sd
B|Um.|b
B|I didn't know that.|sd
A|Well certain schools do it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|This school does.|sd
A|So, uh, It's, it ,|%
B|Huh.|b
A|I, I was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they were,|%
A|this was a college night at a, at a high school in Richardson.|sd
A|And it was,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.|sd
A|There were a hundred schools, probably there all competing for the same kids.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, you know, your,  school|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|your  own school,|^2
A|And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and had heard of, you know, our school. And, and were interested in it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|b
A|Uh, you know, we, uh,|%
A|situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that.|sd
A|That worked out so well.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|So did you drum up any interest then|qy
A|I think so.|aap_am
A|I don't know offhand|no
A|but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, there,  There was one mother who, uh, came by right, even, before we started, who, who obviously was, uh, very interested in getting her, her daughter in or, or having gotten her daughter in or something|sd
B|And that,|%
A|and she was wanting some more information.|sd
A|But she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, a majorette or something. You know, a baton twirler or something|sd

A|and she was she was, letting us know she, how, how good her daughter was.|sd
A|She had cards printed up, actually describing, you know, business cards describing her daughter's, uh, you know, she had won several different twirling awards, and all  this,|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she was, had these business cards she was passing out|sd
A|and it was quite a production.|sd
A|I think some parents go a little bit overboard.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
B|it sounds like it.|aa
A|Yes.|b
B|Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely|sv
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|Not for them, my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home.|ng
A|Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms|sd
A|and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.|sd
A|And, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care|sd
A|and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds the ultimate.|ba
A|Unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.|sd
B|Well, even at that point, most care can be given at, in the home.|sv
B|That sound like just an excellent solution.|ba
B|You must feel real good about that.|qy^d
A|Well, I, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.|arp_nd
A|I, uh, I read a lot|sd
A|and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes|sd
A|and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them.|sd
A|And, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time|sd
A|and they have, uh,|%
A|even the people that are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are incapacitated. Go and, uh, participate in olympics|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, so there are a lot of, a lot of activities going on all the time|sd
A|and this is a nursing home,|sd
A|it's not a senior citizens home.|sd
A|So that the people are really, uh,|sd
B|Really in need of a nursing home.|^2
A|Right.|aa
A|They need,  the nursing care,|sd
B|Right,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, but it's a very expensive solution.|sv
B|Well, it's, you know,|aa
B|I think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.|sv
B|It's just a matter of finding, a good home.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able to afford either of those solutions.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|And that, I think is what is scary,|sv
B|and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes|sv
B|and they really can not afford the best.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|And that's right, I, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation|sd
A|and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,|sd
A|but when they, the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware,|sd
A|I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance|sd
A|and I overheard their conversation.|sd
A|And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what had happened.|sd
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|So, I told them he strangled on some chicken|sd
A|and, uh, they said, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or, so, you know,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and I thought|%
B|What a shame,|ba
B|they put him in the home so that he could be cared for|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|and then  they could have done that well at home.|sv
A|And then she was  upset,|sd
A|he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his.|sd
A|He had on a pair, of slacks,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and the wife said "these are not his slacks"|sd
A|and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."|sd
A|And,|%
B|You hear these stories, all the time.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, I, this was just something that I  was,  I witnessed to.|sd
B|You happened,|%
B|Right.|b
A|And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.|sd
A|And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,|sd
A|and he was definitely,|sd
A|just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care,|sd
A|but the family were all talking about, uh, putting him in another home.|sd
A|They said he will not go back to that one.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
B|Good,|ba
B|I'm glad they have a solution. To do that,|sd
A|I'm glad they the option.|sd
B|yes.|aa
B|I know.|aa
A|I, I would hate  to be in a position where that was all I could afford|sd
A|and there were not, there was no choice.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
B|My, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be seven, eight years,|sd
B|and,  uh, and, uh,  It's just her, her condition deteriorated, deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
A|Um.|b
B|As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from,  from people  who have been independent all their lives.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Like this was a really neat vital woman|sd
B|and you get in a nursing home|sv
B|and the first thing that happens you have to share your, your whole living space, with someone that you have never known before in your  life.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And oh I, I do not know what the answer is,|sd
B|but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there|sv
B|and it, I think it does,|%
B|a lot of it goes down to just money. And family support,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|uh, if you, you know, have family that, uh,  you can live with.|sv
A|Visits everyday.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|I, I really,|%
B|I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know.|sv
B|You would do your research|sv
B|and you would go  visit.|sv
A|Visit,|b^m
A|right.|aa
B|And, uh, hopefully, they would have, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you, a little bit|sv
A|Suspicious.|^2
B|right.|aa
A|You know, I, I, my, I remember my, my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died|sd
A|and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time,|sd
A|but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything,|sd
A|she really was not aware of what she was doing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I I can remember she had several strokes|sd
A|and the nursing home was right next to a hospital|sd
A|and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days.|sd
A|And it was, she was, it was just like keeping something.|sd
B|Well, we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system.|sd
B|Um, I, I really have been pleased with Plano.|sd
B|I have a child who, uh,|sd
B|my son is learning disabled,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into.|sd
A|Now, is he the elementary school?|qy
B|He's in elementary school.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he's not severely learning disabled.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, you know, he just, He's being helped.|sd
A|But he is being helped.|^2
B|He, he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they recently released him from, resource, which I'm, I was thrilled,|sd
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|I really was.|sd
B|I, I just thought that was so neat, that they got him over that hump.|sd
B|And, um, he's in the Herman Method of Reading.|sd
B|I don't know if you're, familiar with that.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|that's something new to me.|sd
A|I'm,|%
B|It is something new,|sd
B|and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Um,|b
A|I think I read about that in the paper.|sd
B|It's wonderful.|sd
A|Doctor Haggard is, is heading that up.|sd
B|Yes,|ny
B|and it's wonderful.|sd
B|He didn't have a problem with reading.|sd
B|As a matter of fact, he's reading on level.|sd
B|The problem was his spelling.|sd
B|And, you know, in, in watching the way he has struggled,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's interesting, because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had, that was ignored.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And,|%
A|Right,|b
A|so you worked, you learned how to solve your problems on your own.|bf
B|That's right.|aa
B|And, and so it's, you know, it's not an intelligence problem.|sd
B|It's just a problem with learning.|sd
A|Has, has he had this since kindergarten,|qy
A|or is this something that maybe learning phonetics,|qrr
A|and then he just didn't learn the right way?|qy
B|Well, you know, it's funny.|sd
B|When, um, when he was in first grade, he had trouble with, with spelling,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I would say to the teacher, you know, it's amazing.|sd
B|He will be able to,|sd
B|you'll say to him, spell cat,|sd
B|and, you know, he'll say C A T,|sd
B|and then he would go to write it,|sd
B|and he would write C O T.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|And I kept saying to the teacher, something is wrong here.|sd
B|Something is wrong here.|^q
A|You're right, right.|aa
B|And the teacher kept saying, oh, he has a May birthday.|sd
B|He's just immature.|^q
A|Right.|b
B|Well, second grade it was,|%
B|I will,|%
B|these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, I went up there,|sd
B|and I, I requested a conference and, because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy.|sd
A|Good,|ba
A|good,|ba
A|that's great for parents to be involved.|ba
B|Well, I was,|sd
B|and I, and I went up there the second week of school|sd
B|and I said, you know, something is wrong,|sd
B|and thank God the the head teacher, the team leader, was a special education major.|sd
A|Oh, how great.|ba
B|It was, it was|aa
B|and, She had picked it up,|sd
A|So she, she was able to zero in.|qy^d
B|yep,|ny
A|Oh.|bk
B|she had already picked it up.|sd
B|And she said, you know, we, we were going to call you if you hadn't called us.|sd
B|We think there's a learning disability|^q
B|and we think he needs to be tested immediately, because, you know, once the first report card comes in, they, have all these people being tested,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and she said, I think we can get him real fast.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And sure enough, they tested him|sd
B|and, you know, he qualified for, for the help,|sd
B|and it's been great,|sd
B|and I, and I thank God I'm here, because I, I know I have a sister who has the other extreme.|sd
B|She has a, a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted,|sd
B|and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|And, and to me that's the same thing.|sv
B|It's, it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored, this poor gifted child is being ignored.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Right,|aa
A|but that's something that parents, I think, are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|So, because, that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but learning disability, unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it real difficult|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and this is, this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that, that, uh, you do have government money to fund, the kinds of programs that these students need,|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem, they test kids before they take them,|sv
B|Exactly,|aa
B|and, They don't take them,|sv
A|and if they're a behavior problem, they're out.|sv
B|that's right.|aa
A|That,|%
A|and, and, uh, this is kind of a rejection type of thing,|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and we get it even at our level in, in,|sv
A|I work a nine ten school,|sd
A|and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the, uh, parochial and and, uh, private schools|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, they come in|sd
A|and their attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and proceed to prove it.|sd
B|Really,|b
B|really.|b
A|So I, I really hate that for them.|sd
A|I, I, would rather they not have that attitude,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but that's,|%
B|Well, when comparing test scores,|%
B|I know recently I was in a discussion|sd
B|and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and that was one of the points that I made, is that you're not comparing apples to apples.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|You know, you can't say, um, you know, I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and, into a private school. And, um, which is, which is too bad.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But on the other hand, I, I can't necessarily blame them, you know, they, they are a private school|sv
A|No.|aa
B|and they, can do whatever they want.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|they can be selective,|sv
A|right.|aa
B|And they they,|%
B|that's right,|aa
B|they have the ability to be selective.|aa
B|But you can't say then, well, public schools are, are not as good.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Perhaps they are, because they're, they're,|sv
A|If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them, and then compared them to the to the private school group, then I think you would have a more equitable way.|sv
B|You're right.|aa
A|And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here.|sd
A|In, in, in, uh, honesty, the kids in Japan are, they have to try out to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going to get into,|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|and then after, uh,|%
A|and if, if you only,|%
A|the, in fact, they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and if they don't, then when they reach a certain age, they just, that's the end of their schooling.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and, uh, they don't ever really go on.|sd
A|It's only their top ones that go on, like ours do.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And, and, uh, so that, that creates a problem.|sv
A|And, and you can't compare, because they go so many more hours.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education, and is that child.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|well, you see that with the foreigners that come here.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|Um, I, I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had to be the best,|sd
B|and they put off all social life, all everything, you know.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|Well, is that good?|qh
B|Yes,|ny
B|the child is very bright,|sd
B|but on the other hand, I feel like my children, who are kind of middle of the road, have, are more rounded, you know.|sv
A|Better coping skills.|^2
A|Yes.|aa
B|Sure,|b
B|sure,|b
B|I think it's real important to have friends.|sv
B|I think it's real important to play sports.|sv
B|I think it's real important to be part of a team.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And so that's why I said, their childhood is extremely different from mine.|sd
B|We didn't do all that you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|We certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do. Um,|sd
A|Well, and you don't, you don't see the parents, uh, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or, drill teams or band,|sv
B|No.|aa
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|it's strictly stick to the educational,|sv
A|and it's interesting to see them as they get older, uh, then that is the type of adult they are.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|b
A|Uh, I guess my personal opinion, I, I don't mind paying taxes necessarily.|sd
A|I, I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, sometimes when I hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, uh, I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them, uh,|sv
A|and that's all tax money.|sv
A|When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much, it's just billions of dollars|sv
A|that's, I think is just being thrown away.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|And then when you read about that they're spending all the money on, you know, these studies that have no relevance whatsoever, that kind of ticks you off, too.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I, I, I tend to agree with that|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm not really into what they're doing per se,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I think there's just too many, too many levels of bureaucracy.|sv
B|I think it can be, can be managed by less, uh, less levels.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Well, I know any time there's, there's a big, uh, budget cut, you know,|sv
A|I work with the state,|sd
A|and any time there's, there is a budget cut or crunches, it's always the small guy that, that gets hurt.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|It's never the, uh, the person that's making a hundred thousand there.|sv
A|It's always the person that's making the least amount,|sv
A|and uh, and sometimes we're running around there.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I see these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having meetings.|sd
A|I, I really don't know what they do.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,|sd
A|or,|%
B|Right,|aa
B|well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government.|sv
B|I just, you know,|%
B|I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,|sv
B|and you're out, you know.|^q
B|I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,|sv
B|but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it.|sd
B|Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.|sv
B|And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here|sv
A|and you|%
B|Right.|b
A|so.|%
A|Gas, I don't know about you guys,|h
A|but there's probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of different taxes on, on our gas.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And you don't realize,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we got a sales tax.|sd
B|Our sales tax is like eight percent,|sd
B|and I don't know what our gas tax is.|sd
B|I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So. I mean, they're hitting us up,|sv
B|and they may not raise it, you know, federally as much one year,|sv
B|but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.|sv
B|It's just, I mean, you can see that your money is just not going that far.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, I know they say like with Reagan, they say no new taxes,|sv
A|but they changed the, uh, deductions on you,|sv
A|and that just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different way|sv
B|Right.|b
A|so, I mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|well, I mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have left over,|sv
B|and all of a sudden, I don't know it's just, it's eating me alive.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I heard someone say that, uh, if they would just, something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'll let you start this time.|ad
B|Well, how much do you like lawn and garden work?|qw
A|Well, uh, even though it's totally out of my, uh, my degree training, I've been working as, as, in the horticultural aspect, so the last, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, so Uh, I'm,|arp_nd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Oh, for goodness sakes.|ba
B|What do you do?|qo
A|Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well, that's interesting.|ba
B|Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't know,|h
A|I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well I love to work outside, really,|sd
B|and I enjoy flowers and stuff.|sd
B|I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,|sd
B|and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that.|sd
B|I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,|sd
B|and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so the hibiscus plants no longer exist|sd
A|Oh, that's terrible.|ba
A|Twenty-three|%
B|And I really feel bad about it,|sd
B|it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, they're all gone at this point.|sd
B|Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though.|sd
B|I grew up in Illinois|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,|sd
B|why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh, watering system.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|and and I just think it's ugly|sv
B|When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant.|sv
A|I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
A|yeah,|b
A|those two.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.|sd
B|They have to water an incredible amount.|sd
B|But, um, those those lawns look nice during the winter,|sd
B|but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb.|sd
B|But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,|sd

A|I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was.|qw^d
B|I think it's a hundred years.|sd

B|I,|%
B|it's, it's kind of funny.|sd
B|I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think,|sd
B|I can't quite remember the name of the book,|sd

B|And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,|sd
B|every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship|sd
A|Right,|b
A|so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.|qy^d

B|yeah.|ny
A|Did they have Thing|qy
A|and,|%

A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay.|bk
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|that's what I was thinking.|sd
B|Well, do you do any recycling?|qy
A|Uh, we do here.|na
A|Uh, see, what do we recycle?|t1
A|We, they recycle,|%
A|they have bins|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles|sd
A|and I think that's all they have.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|What about you guys?|qo
B|Well, we, uh,|%
B|there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,|sd
B|they're like unattended aluminum can smashers|sd
B|And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,|sd
B|we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,|sd
B|so if you,|%
A|Really?|bh
B|Yeah|ny
A|For smashed cans?|qy
B|Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed.|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot.|sd
A|Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?|ad
B|Sure.|aa
A|I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed|sd
B|Okay.|b
B|Okay?|qy
A|Oh, okay,|na
A|well, I guess, I guess,|sd
B|Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|Okay,|b
A|well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can.|bf
A|Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?|qy
B|Uh, no,|nn
B|you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Exactly|aa
A|and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,|bf
A|so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed.|bf
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|Type of thing.|bf
B|Okay,|b
B|no,|ar
B|they don't charge us that extra nickel.|sd
A|That's sort of nice, though|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it, it really is.|aa
B|Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|so you guys can actually get ahead|qy^d
B|Yeah|ny
A|But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for.|sd
A|Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|everyone does newspapers.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|everybody does newspapers.|aa
A|But, that, that kind of stuff.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,|sd
A|it doesn't fit in their little containers|sd
A|and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something.|sd
B|Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever up there|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|Exactly,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|send it to this address,|sv
A|no|ar
A|But, uh, let's see,|^h
A|they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,|sd
B|I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's,|%
B|In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. You know.|sv
A|As likely to do it.|^2
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money or doing your banking.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, if it's free, people will use it,|sv
B|if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|You know.|b
B|But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the you know, the the drain sewer.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, all that, because there was,|sd
B|apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil,|sd
B|they just dump all the their old oil down there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.|sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other.|sv
A|And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for,|sv
A|but you, you got the use out of it|sv
A|and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so that's something that I've never,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, we're, we're new to Iowa|sd
A|so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before.|sd
A|But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay,|b^m
B|I guess we're ready to start.|sv
B|Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?|qw
A|I'm in Dallas, Texas.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|What about yourself?|qo
B|Well, I'm also in Dallas.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas|qy
B|and,|%
A|No,|nn
A|I've lived here for almost five years now.|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|And I'm a, uh,|%
A|before that I was at school in Rochester, New York|sd
A|and I'm originally from Boston.|sd
B|Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood.|qy^d
A|That's right,|na
A|but I like it.|sd
B|You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.|qy^d
A|Well, I missed it at first,|arp_nd
A|but now I go back there|sd
A|and I'm a real wimp about the cold|sd
A|So I like it here.|sd
B|Yeah.|bk
A|It's nice.|sv
B|Well, that's good.|ba
B|I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Around in Texas|sd
B|and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.|sd
B|I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do.|sd
A|I know.|aa
B|I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that.|sd
A|Uh, tell me where that is, uh,|ad
B|Okay.|aa
A|I, I probably do know,|sd
B|Uh, you,|%
A|but I don't know it by that name.|sd
B|This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake.|sd
A|Oh, okay,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I know that area.|sd
A|That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range.|ba
B|Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area.|sd
B|Uh, my particular,|%
B|I guess they want us to describe the area,|sv
B|so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller.|sd
B|Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land.|sd
B|And, of course, it's pretty static right now|sd
B|and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|How about you?|qo
A|Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas.|sd
A|I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
B|Okay.|bk
A|And, I guess we have a similar situation.|sv
A|I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street|sd
A|so I don't I don't even know how high those go,|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|but some of those are pretty big.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|those are over a million.|sv
A|Yeah|aa
A|So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all.|sd
A|They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Not as bad as Houston,|sv
B|but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|I've noticed that.|sd
B|Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|or,|%
A|Uh, we've got a house,|sd
A|let's see,|^h
A|we moved in about four years ago|sd
A|and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,|sd
A|but it had existed for three years.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|This is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of them|sd
A|and, I guess he, he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away, type of deal|sd
A|So the whole block was all foreclosed.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many.|sd
B|Well, your, was your house in good shape,|qy
B|was it damaged?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|no,|nn
A|the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open|sd
B|Oh, it was?|bh
A|But,|%
A|yeah.|%
B|Oh.|bk
A|So we just, you know, we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that.|sd
B|I see.|b
A|And, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems|sd
A|and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything.|sd
A|But the prices are much lower here|sd
A|and this was definitely not a fix up special,|sd
A|but I'll tell you,|^h
A|it takes all my time|sd
A|Between, we put in our own sprinkler system|sd
A|and I just finished repainting the exterior and, you know, making drapes and buying furniture,|sd
A|it's just a money pit. Really is.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I am familiar with that.|sd
B|I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it.|sd
B|And we bought it from someone who was in it,|sd
B|but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm not sure what happened,|sd

B|And so the second question, forgot what the second question,|sd
A|What was it, uh,|t1
A|what do the trends in families|qo
A|and do we approve what other, families do.|qy
B|Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|But I have seen  lately,  yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,|sd
A|A change?|qy
A|I was going to say the same thing.|sd
B|schools are not able to|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or  whatever, uh,|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and the family|%
A|Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh.|qy
B|those are the two that can,  that, that have the wherewithal|sv
B|and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,|sv
B|so|%
A|Oh.|b
B|I firmly believe that, uh,|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|You think you're getting your money's worth?|qy
B|Uh, never|ng
B|Uh, the only thing I'm, I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in, in Texas.|sd
A|Well, that's probably the next year's agenda.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Boy, I tell you what,|^h
B|I sure hope they don't pass something like that.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around,|sv
A|and I, I think one way or the other, we're going to pay for the bureaucracy, I guess.|sv
A|Uh, it's one area that is really, I, I think hurting the economy more than anything.|sv
A|I think the taxes have just, every time you turn around they, they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products,|sv
A|and I, I, I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.|sv
B|Well, I, I tell you, um,|^h
B|I remember every time, it seems like, we turned around, they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|And actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?|qw
A|Yep,|ny
A|that's right.|aa
B|And every time you go to buy anything now, uh,|sv
B|even, you know, they, they tax food.|sv
B|That's the one that really kind of bothers me.|sd
A|Well, I think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability to pay, which allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards.|sv
A|But, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything they buy, and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going to be paying taxes on, you know.|sv
A|And, uh, that's the unfair equity, inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue,|sv
A|but I don't think it is anymore, not in Texas anyway.|sd
B|Oh, I got you, because people that, uh, don't make very much money wind up spending it all.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|whatever they spent it on, they have to pay tax on.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
A|And that's the unfairness of the thing,|sv
A|but, uh, I think taxes generally are unfair|sv
A|so|%
B|what do you think of that new luxury car tax, anything over ten or thirty thousand dollars?|qo
A|Well, you know, like other things, if they don't affect you, you don't worry about them too much.|arp_nd
A|I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still,|sd
A|so it doesn't,|%
A|I, I think, uh, you know, generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line, which is, uh,  you know.|sv
B|Oh, sure.|aa
A|And, uh, I guess if people got thirty, forty thousand bucks to spend on a car, uh, that's their prerogative, you know|sv
A|I, I, I don't have a whole of sympathy on that .|sd
A|You, maybe you buy that, you know,|qy^d
A|and I don't mean to be  knocking, uh,|sd
B|No,|nn
B|uh, no,|nn
B|I haven't,|sd
B|but it, it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.|sv
B|And there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|there are,|aa
A|there are.|aa
A|And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that, I guess, you know, unless they really want it, buy something that, you know,|sv
A|more, well, it, it's just like having taxes on, or exemptions for kids, you know.|sv
A|It's a way of increasing the population, that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And where you exempt things, like, uh, uh, one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably Lloyd Bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be, you know, spending more money using their credit cards.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Now, I don't know if that's true or not,|sd
A|but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers.|sv
B|Sure.|aa
A|So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,|sv
A|example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,|sv
A|it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know|sv
A|They quit buying it.|sv
B|Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?|qo
A|Well, tell me about your home.|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|Uh, right now we're living in,|sd
B|well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.|sd
B|And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,|sd
B|but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.|sd
B|So it was enough.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.|sd
B|Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house|sd
B|and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.|sd
A|It sounds nice.|ba
B|It's, uh, pretty nice.|aa
B|Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already|sd
A|Oh, yeah?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|It was a,|%
B|Landmark is the one who built it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's true.|aa
A|And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.|sd
B|Exactly what happened to them.|aa
A|I'm building my own house.|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Are you doing it yourself?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Wow.|ba
A|I used to be a builder.|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|And I retired about five years ago  and  started college.|sd
B|Oh, I  see.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|And now I'm a college educated builder|sd
A|There's still no work, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh,  you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials|sd
A|so I did.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.|sd
B|is that so?|bh
B|I didn't know that.|sd
A|You can borrow the  money to pay somebody else to build your house|sd
A|but you can't borrow the money to build your own.|sd
B|Well that sounds kind of dumb.|ba
A|Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then it doesn't sell|sd
A|and then the  bank's  holding the bag.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well.|%
B|Huh.|b
A|As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to  costs three times as much. Right?|sv
B|That's right|aa
A|Hence the savings and loan problem we have.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's good.|ba

A|Well, I figure it's just me and my wife|sd

A|Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.|arp_nd

B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Wow.|ba

B|My  wife would love that|sd

B|That's right.|na
B|How old are your children?|qw
A|We have,|%
A|ours start at twelve|sd

B|I think the hardest thing for us has been, is to find you know, leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have, you know,|sd
A|I bet,|ba
A|yeah.|%
B|like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yes,|b
A|uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh|b

A|That's good.|ba

A|Oh, good.|ba
B|I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.|sv
A|I think so,|aa
A|and I feel like, you know, like President Bush, Bush has mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation,|sd
A|and it does begin with the families at home|sv
B|Yeah.|b

B|Huh.|b
B|Yes,|b
B|it's,  it's, it's it's similar to aerobics with weights|sv

B|Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics,|sd
B|and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.|sd
B|But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know, that and movement of going up on the step you know, that could create a problem.|sv
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|They, they seem to think that it, it won't,|sv

B|I did, I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off,|sd
A|and the muscle builds real fast.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, you can start,|%
A|they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month|sd
A|and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, uh, twenty-five pound dumbbells|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video|sd
A|and it's a hour long video,|sd
A|so.|%
B|So it's a good workout.|bf
A|It is,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|I really enjoy that,|sd
A|so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of,|qy^d
B|it's quite cold and snow.|qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
A|Yes.|ny
A|Now this one has been quite mild.|sd
A|Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.|sd
A|It was quite chilly|sd
A|but not,|%
B|Hello.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I pressed the button one,|sd
A|so we're recording right now.|sd
A|I'm sorry|fa
B|That's okay.|bd
B|I'm Bill from Raleigh.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.|sd
B|Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Um, okay,|b
A|Bill, we're talking about family reunions.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|have you ever had to plan a family reunion?|qy
B|Uh, yes|ny
B|and no,|nn
B|it wasn't really a a planning one,|sd
B|but it was kind of, uh, it was a birthday|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|and I brought a lot of family together then.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
A|And how did you feel it went?|qo
B|It went pretty good.|sd
B|I'm, I've worked in hotels,|sd
B|so I, I kind of know how to do these things.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|I used to, you know.|sd
A|All this planning and, and getting together and such.|qy^d
A|Um, oh, let's see what else.|^h
B|Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,|sd
B|and and it's all of like, she, she comes from a big family.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She has like seven sisters I think.|sd
A|Oh, boy|ba
B|They show up and all their kids.|sd
B|And then all, she has, uh,|%
B|I have like, uh,|%
B|let's see,|^h
B|she has four sons and two daughters,|sd
B|and they show up and all their kids,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so it's a pretty big reunion,|sd
B|it's about two hundred people, maybe.|sd
A|Oh, my word.|ba
A|Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?|qo
B|Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something like that.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Uh-huh.|bk
B|And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks|sd
B|and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|bk
A|and then did you have a main meal,|qy
A|or did everyone just bring,|%
A|it  was just pot luck.|qy^d
B|It was kind of  pot luck.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|show off a little bit|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first because she's such a great cook.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh.|bk
A|Now how old is she?|qw
B|Uh, she's eighty-six.|sd
A|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.|qy
B|Now she does,|%
B|she looks probably like she's in her early sixties|na
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age.|ba
A|Yeah.|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b^m
B|My nickname for her is Honey Woman.|sd
B|That's what I call her.|sd
A|Really.|b
A|Well that sounds fun.|ba
A|Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,|sd
A|and there were,|%
A|we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.|sd
A|And so that was a real challenge,|sd
A|and I was president of our family reunion for two years,|sd
A|and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,|sd
A|but I found that advance planning was the key to success.|sd
B|Uh, also one thing that's helpful,|sv
B|and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|but most of, all my family lives like in the same county|sd
B|so|%
A|Oh, that's wonderful, though|ba
B|But it's just kind of like get on the telephone|ad
B|and, it's so and such days from such and such date|^q
A|Oh.|b
B|and everybody just shows up.|sv
A|Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.|aa
A|Yeah,|%
A|our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,|sd
A|I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.|sd
B|I would say you're spread out, then.|sv
A|We are|aa
B|Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,|sd
B|because my dad was in the Army|sd
B|and we're we're pretty strung out all over.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County.|sd
A|In.|%
A|Oh.|b
B|I live in Raleigh,|sd
B|and then my, my parents live in Greenville,|sd
B|and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville, and, uh, another brother that lives in, outside of Fayetteville.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I mean, we're, we're spread out,|sd
B|but everybody else is centralized in, in, my home town, Waynesboro|sd
A|Boy.|ba
B|so.|%
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Nobody moves away except us|sd
A|They must really like it there.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I got out as soon as I graduated.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh.|b
B|Just like this town is too small for me,|sd
B|Good-bye.|^q
A|Oh, you're ready to move on to|qy^d
A|How do you feel about gun control?|qo
B|Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed|sv
A|Um.|b
B|but it's going to,|%
B|a lot of the stuff that,|%
B|I mean all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too long ago, But I don't really know, I mean, unless they do, uh, just outlaw them, how you can, uh, prevent that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that,|%
B|well do you even know what the procedures are now?|qy
B|Um.|b
A|There is no national,|sd
B|But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.|sv
A|Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon. You know or on probation or, uh, you know, other obvious things like that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,|sd
A|and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.|sd
B|Huh. I didn't know that.|sd
B|Well, that's pretty scary.|ba
B|So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.|qy
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.|sd
B|That's where I would probably be|sd
A|Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.|sv
B|Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I can understand them wanting to have them,|sd
B|but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.|sv
A|Well, you know, uh, uh,|%
A|if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know|sv
A|the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.|sv
B|It has?|bh
B|Because then,|%
A|Well I mean  yeah.|ny
A|The, uh, the|%
A|in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.|sv
B|Um.|b
A|Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out  there already.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.|sv
B|Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?|qy
A|Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.|no
A|I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,|sd
A|but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|I know Dallas is.|sd
A|Uh.  I mean, I think, you know, in the|%
A|I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.|sd
B|I don't know if Dallas is in the top three|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but. Do you own a gun?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|I've thought about getting one.|sd
A|If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.|sd
A|I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.|sd
A|I would probably get like a shotgun.|sd
A|Just for protecting myself. You know, from burglar type thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I do kind of live in the downtown area.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know and shotguns are really good because they're,|sv
A|I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|Uh, and you know, you,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.|sd
A|They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know,|sv
A|they are probably going to miss the person|sv
A|and, and they're going to shoot through five wall, and hit someone, you know.|sv
A|I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.|sv
A|You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You pretty much stop them.|sv
A|And, you don't,|%
A|then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.|sv
B|and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I finally ended up giving it back to him.|sd
B|I said I don't want it.|sd
B|I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to, you know, be responsible enough to go out and learn, I don't need it.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns|sd
A|because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot,|sv
A|but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that, that person rushes you.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|And they get it from you.|sv
A|And you know, you're pretty much dead  you know.  Because you, you've just told the person that you, you're about to kill them then, You know|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Set them off.|^2
A|and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them|sv
A|and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.|sd
B|I thought well you know. I don't want it if I don't know how to you know, if I don't really know how to use it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just didn't want the responsibility.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|right.|na
B|That kind of I mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I would be scared selling guns to people.|sd
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, first, um, I need to know, uh, how do you feel about, uh, about sending, uh, an elderly, uh, family member to a nursing home?|qo
B|Well, of course, it's, you know, it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do, you know. Unless it's just, you know, really, you know, and, uh, for their, uh, you know, for their own good.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|I'd be very very careful and, uh, you know, checking them out.|sd
B|Uh, our,|%
B|had place my mother in a nursing home.|sd
B|She had a rather massive stroke about, uh, about uh, eight months ago I guess.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we were, I was fortunate in that|sd
B|I was personally acquainted with the, uh, people who, uh, ran the nursing home in our little hometown.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I was very comfortable, you know, in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it.|sd
B|But there's,|%
B|well, I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be, you know, could not take care of herself anymore, was confined to a nursing home for a while|sd
B|that was really not a very good experience.|sd
B|Uh, it had to be done in a hurry.|sd
B|I mean, we didn't have, you know, like six months to check all of these places out.|sd
B|And it was really not, not very good, uh, deal.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We were not really happy with, nursing home that we finally had.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Fortunately, she only had to stay in a few weeks|sd
B|and she was able to, to return to her apartment again.|sd
B|But it's really a big, uh, big, uh, decision as to, you know, when to do it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, is there something else we could have done, you know, in checking out all the places that, uh, might be available.|qh
B|Of course, you know, there's not one on every corner, especially, you know, smaller areas, smaller towns.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Probably the hardest thing in, in my family, uh, my grandmother, she had to be put in a nursing home|sd
A|and, um, she had used the walker for, for quite some time, probably about six to nine months.|sd
A|And, um, she had a fall|sd
A|and, uh, finally, uh, she had Parkinson's disease,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Then she lived in an apartment|sd
A|and, uh, that was even harder actually.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because it was, you know, it was just a change of, change of location|sd
A|and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|I mean, she she had, she had children all across the United States|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and, you know, she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, that was pretty heart-rending for her.|sd
B|I can imagine.|ba
A|I think when she finally came to the realization that, you know, no, I cannot, I cannot take care of myself.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's tough.|ba
B|That's tough.|ba
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I mean, for somebody who is, you know, for most of their life has, has, uh, not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm, ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, you know, facing that situation, it's, it's quite a dilemma.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|I think,|%
B|my mother, excuse me.|fa
B|Go ahead.|ad
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, my, uh, my, uh,|%
A|probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think that they, they had a great deal of, um,|sd
A|all the brothers and sisters got together|sd
A|and they actually had a conference.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|And, I mean, it was just, it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family, getting down together and doing that.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|And, and just the children were involved in the decision, because it involved just them. And, you know, making that decision and then finding a place|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and everybody had duties to perform.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, whether it was just, you know, giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot, of the decision making, you know, like finding a proper nursing home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yep.|b
B|You were very, fortunate.|sv
A|And they,|%
A|I know.|aa
A|They, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it coming.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, so,|%
A|I mean, it,|%
A|I mean, I, I, I, I I, I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like, that for me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|Unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities like that seem to fall to, you know, maybe one child in the whole family, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, we, we,|%
B|And, uh, it's usually not a very smooth, smooth thing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|We were, I was lucky too that I only have one brother.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, fortunately, we agreed, you know, on exactly, you know, what we thought should be done.|sd
B|My mother also was very very independent.|sd
B|She had her own, still had her own little house and still driving her own car, at age eighty-three.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We were lucky in, that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really, you know, really much aware of what was going on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her choosing,|sd
B|of course, she would, she would not have been happy there at all.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, with my, with my grandmother I think it was, it was such that, uh, that she did not have the problem with,|sd
A|she was very well aware|sd
A|and her daughter came and visited her|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|at least her daughter, came and visited her and also her several grandchildren, came and visited her every day.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's great.|ba
A|And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest,|sv
A|um, I, I, I think it would be,|sv
A|it was more of a relief for her.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|aa
A|And, um,|%
A|I mean, but she was truly, she was truly aware.|sd
A|I mean, I, I, I I don't know how I would, how I would deal if one of my parents came with, with Alzheimer's. or something like, that which is, which is far more devastating.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That would be tough.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|And, um, I, I, I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of care but the quality of, care.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|That the people that worked there were very were very interested that, to make it as close a home environment, as possible.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
B|It would,|%
A|I think, I think, I think, you know for myself I, I see that as probably the, the, what everything would hinge upon.|sd
B|Oh,|b
A|Is it,|%
A|how close is it to a home environment.|qh
B|Yes.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|That's the, that's probably the major question.|sv
B|I think that great strides are being made nowadays in, in caring for the elderly, you know, in several, in a, in a whole lot of areas.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Just people are, of course, populations getting older.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|You know it's, it's interesting that, that a lot, the population of the United States is changing because, you know, uh, now that so many more minorities, where they have had extended families for such a long time.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
A|It wasn't,|%
B|true.|aa
A|But, I guess as we become more industrialized and more, you know, less in a rural situation we, we don't, we, we, we choose not to deal with the, extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome, when in reality it makes things much much easier.|sv
B|Yes, um.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|aa
B|Sure.|aa
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|And, people, things are scattered so much nowadays.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I, I, I think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|You know I mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know, whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good, they're going to be a good caretaker for our children.|sv
B|Yes,|b
A|But,|%
B|just because they're grandparents.|sv
A|I mean they raised us after all.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|But, uh, I, I, I think that, you know, we always, uh, I mean, I've, I've had a lot of good experiences with, uh, with many many people especially where they've had, uh, extended family.|sd
A|And I, and I, I kind of see that, that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of, you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, uh, it's,|%
A|money seems to be too big of an issue. With, with, with, with what's going on today|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|sure.|aa
B|realistically it is.|aa
A|and I, I think, I think that we may not, that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may, that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That would, certainly help.|aa
A|I mean, I mean we may not, we may not have as high a standard of living|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but the but actually have a truer standard of living.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|That's just a matter of defining priorities, I guess or some priorities anyway.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think your right.|aa
A|Okay.|b
A|Well, I guess that was it|fc
B|Okay.|fc
B|It was good talking to you.|fc
A|Okay.|fc
B|Yeah.|fc
A|All right.|fc
B|Take care.|fc
A|Hey.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Well, the first thing for me is I wonder, I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, um, if privacy is something that disturbs your private state, I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state,|sv
A|that's one thing,|sv
A|and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something out about you that's another.|sv
A|And the first kind of invasion of, the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in this country,|sv
A|but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that should be private, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.|sv
B|I, I think I agree with that.|aa
B|I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens, uh, when the phone rang|sv
B|and it's T I calling,|sd
B|my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message|sd
B|and then I realize, oh, no, this is something I solicited,|sd
A|That's right|aa
B|so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion|sd
B|but after that I realized, no, I, I really wanted this|sd
B|and it was sort of exciting|sd
B|and so, that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|it turned out to be, uh, uh, an invitation.|bf
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Uh, and at the same time I think that I receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it.|sd
A|From, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh, commercial things.|qy
B|Commercial, solicitations primarily.|sd
A|Oh, that, that's a remarkable number.|ba
A|I get them rarely|sd
A|and I'm still astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever|sd
A|Um, because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what, they are.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.|sv
A|I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say,|sv
A|and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there.|sv
B|And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control|sv
B|and you, one's feeling obligated, because of some sense of, of the way the ritual is played out.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|And, and, uh, that, that then ends up being the, the most common example for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, this one that you raised.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I don't think I would have thought about that.|sd
B|I think that's a good idea on your part.|sv
B|I don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of finding out information.|sd
A|Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,|sd
A|and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge.|sv
A|So there's, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,|sv
A|and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia|sv
A|It's a surmise|sv
A|and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country.|sv
B|To, to surmise. It is there.|sv
A|I don't think I'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that.|sd
B|Well, I guess, although, I, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is, because, uh, if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
B|Uh, if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it, well, then I guess one could assume one was invaded|sv
A|uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|but I don't feel invaded by it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
B|I don't, have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things,|sd
A|uh-huh.|b
B|I'm not sure why.|sd
B|Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts|sv
B|and if someone finds out something about me that is true, I, I don't have a sense of loss from that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then|qy^d
B|Um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|more harmed or something.|sv
B|right,|aa
B|because, you don't have anyway to turn it off.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I did.|sd
A|I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it.|sd
B|That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a, that I would rather they didn't|sd
B|and that might be the sense of the spending pattern, for instance, that, that I would have thought to be private.|sd
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b
B|But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse|sv
B|so, or if my call rate of, of eight or so a week went up even higher because uh, someone had, had,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|They had you pegged|^2
B|Right.|aa
B|And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money|sv
B|and then all of, a sudden you get your thirty a week because now, they're advertising you.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|Exactly.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.|sd
A|I mean, they said they would give it out to only select companies|sd
A|but, um, you know, just like software is only given out to customers,|sd
A|I mean, you can't believe that.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|It would, it would be pirated|sv
A|and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash price, for it.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has to do with it|sv
A|and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending habits are,|sv
A|and, you know, and, and that hacker just has to get in to, in touch with the sneak thief|sv
A|and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling, threatened as a result of, of it|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, maybe that is a, a little bit of what privacy is.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|I also thought about it, was of, uh, waiting to talk to you that, another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.|sd
A|But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy.|sv
A|If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I realize that that, I mean, I can take that for granted|sd
A|but I used to, I used to live in India|sd
A|and things are quite different there in terms of that.|sd
A|There's less of a sense of privacy.|sd
A|In fact, it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy,|sd
A|certainly the language I know doesn't, but just says a word for loneliness.|sd
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.|sd
B|But, but no concept for wanting to be private.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's, it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially.|sv
B|Okay.|b
A|Um, so there's not,|%
A|I mean, doors don't have latches on them.|sd
A|People don't tend to knock,|sd
A|you just,|%
A|if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way|sd
A|you, people walk in out|sd
A|and, as a, as a westerner in India, and I was often surprised, and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|That, that would be, That would be culturally shocking|sv
A|You know, it very much is.|aa
A|But on the other hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and people would leave, me alone.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.|sv
A|Um, people start paying attention to you very much|sv
A|and they start asking questions and in the sense are invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.|sv
A|But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|And which isn't of, always the case in all cultures,|sv
A|and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.|sd
B|that is true.|aa
B|I haven't thought about that|sd
B|and, and that it's fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|And that's really, um,|%
A|well, I mean, I, I wonder how people have sex, and things like that,|sd
A|I mean, they|%
A|you go to India|sd
A|and it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.|sd
A|Um, but I, I just don't quite, um,|%
A|there's hope, I actually for|%
A|of the time I've spent there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Because anyone can be alone for some period of time|sd
A|but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|And if that's gone, um, I, I really don't know how to live very well,|sd
A|and I wonder, I really do wonder how people do that.|sd
B|That's interesting.|ba
B|Are are there any other specific things that, that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?|qy
A|All the the other classic examples, the Jehovah's Witness or, or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away.|na
A|And there's that sense of, I have now opened my door they now see what I look like, what I live like|sd
A|and and they're doing something that normally I really only invite, people to.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|Because I, any, anyone, any friend, anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me,|sd
A|but no one is just welcome to come by my house.|sd
A|So that is more of a sense of invasion.|sv
B|So, that's another example of the invasion because of the not so ...|%

A|I think it's fun,|sv
A|I like just looking at the billboards.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.|sv

A|Uh-huh|b
B|But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,|sd

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|right.|b
B|And it's going to go to the highest bidder|sd

A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah,|b
B|I would think it,|ba

A|and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you get tired of that.|sv
B|That's typical bureaucracy though.|sv
B|That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go|sv
B|it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know,|h
B|sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.|sv
A|Well, but they can't be though,|ar
A|they don't have as much money.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|Most of the time.|sv
B|but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.|sv
A|Oh man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration,|sd
A|there's so many of them|sd
B|You don't even know who to payoff, huh?|qh
A|I mean, somebody walks in the, a classroom|sd

B|No communication whatsoever.|qy^d
A|No.|nn

A|No,|ar

B|The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|aa

A|They usually pick their own.|sd
B|I bet they do.|ba
A|You know, they've got it all figured out.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they want to see all the horror movies.|qy^d
A|Well, and Ninja Turtles.|arp_nd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Ninja Turtles, got to have those.|aa

A|Just massive rental.|qy^d
B|well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, uh, taking them out to the show.|sv
A|Going to,|%
A|I know.|aa
B|Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one one time.|sv
A|That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just, plug it in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything, decent.|sv
A|I know in|aa
A|It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though|sv

B|That's true.|aa
A|Unbelievable|ba

B|We saw, um, HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was okay,|sd
B|it was kind of slow,|sd

B|It just, it,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|it one of those movies it's not going to be around long,|sd

B|Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.|sd
A|You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|sure did.|sd
A|Well, I was reading the book,|sd
A|and it's called SHOELESS JOE.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|It was so wonderful.|sd
A|And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this author,|sd
A|so I got a, uh, book of his short stories,|sd

B|Who is the, is the author?|qw
A|Don't, don't ask me|no
B|Oh|bk
A|The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.|sd
B|Shoeless Joe.|b^m
B|Was it like the movie?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
B|Okay.|bk
A|quite a, quite a bit.|sd
A|But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|he wasn't in the book,|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|that's one difference.|sd
A|There really wasn't a lot of difference.|sd
B|I didn't,|sd
B|see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.|sd
B|That's interesting.|ba
B|That was a good movie, too.|sv
A|Well, do you think we covered baseball?|qy
B|I think so|na
A|Okay,|fc
A|well, have a good night.|fc
A|Well, um, I'm, uh, pretty pro gun control over all.|sd
A|I, uh, I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control|sd
A|and, uh, I must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which I find very compelling, although most the people who argue gun control with me I find, uh, use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the N R A slogan arguments|sd
A|and, um, uh, see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it. Um,|sd
A|I guess on a one, a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns|sd
A|and I have to admit most of that is, uh, strong personal distaste.|sd
A|I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort. Um,|sd
A|and, uh, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.|sd
B|Well, me being from Texas|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I hope you're ready for this.|qy^d
A|Um, uh, I'll give it a try.|na
A|I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.|sd
B|Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.|sd
B|I was raised around guns, hunting.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I I respect them and what their capabilities are.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's pretty power isn't it|qy
B|And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country,|sd
B|and here, here, here you go,|^h
B|here you,|%
B|this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Okay.|b
B|When you, I mean, you've heard the, the slogan, um, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|That applies to anything as well as guns.|sv
A|a gun.|%
B|Well, you, you've got,|%
B|well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs|sv
B|and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they get out their little Mac tens,|sv
B|they get out their little uzis|sv
B|and they're going to fight with them.|sv
B|And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.|sv
B|If they want it they'll get it.|sv
B|I don't care if, if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it|sv
B|they'll get it|sv
B|and they'll get across the border.|sv
B|Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.|sv
B|If they want to run a background check on me, fine.|sd
B|If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|If they want, want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't,|sv
A|you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope. I mean, because I mean someone|sv
A|the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun|sd
A|and someone the personal sheriff,|%
B|Well,|%
B|the only, well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has, is this guy a convicted felon? Uh,|sv
B|is he a habitual trouble maker?|^q
B|Are we picking him up every Saturday, for a drunk and disorderly|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.|^q
B|You know, just proving that you're a basically a good citizen.|sv
A|But if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen,|sv
A|you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.|sv
B|If, if they want the firepower they can get it.|sv
A|So why|%
B|because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are|sv
B|they'll get it across the border one way or the other.|sv
A|So why have any restrictions at all?|qh
B|Uh, okay.|b
B|go back to that one to ten scale where one, being, full gun control, ten being none.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'd said about an eight.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, we can could be,|%
B|I said the restrictions I would like to see on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun,|sd
B|I would like to see them go through either,|sd
B|I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,|sd
B|but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun.|sv
B|You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to properly maintain it, the three basics.|sv
A|Well, that makes a lot of since to me.|aa
A|I mean, I certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm|sv
A|but, uh, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.|aa
B|Well, the|%
B|in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon, as a, as a pistol.|sv
A|Yeah|b
A|Well, I have a bicycle|sd
A|and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things.|sd
A|Well, I'm still, I'm still puzzled though, what is the argument,|qw
A|how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway.|qw
A|What's the point of putting a|qw
A|basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway|sv
A|they're not going to take those courses.|sv
A|Is it, uh, is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?|qy
B|Well there's,|%
A|If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices|sv
A|does that, uh, mean advantage?|qy
B|Uh, not necessarily a price thing.|ng
B|What is happening at least in this state|sd
B|and I expect to see it in other states very soon,|sv
B|legislation been introduced as that, if a citizen of the state, being, myself, has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course, I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed.|sd

A|hasn't yet used a gun in a, haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony,|sv
A|if you let them all walk around carrying guns|sv
A|in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.|sv
A|You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.|sv
A|It's, it's hard for me to imagine that a, a situation of, you know,|sd
A|take it to a logical extreme,|ad
A|if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.|sv
B|I, actually it's|%
B|it's more of a police action in itself,|sv
B|the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, well, I'm going to mug this guy right here|sv
B|but hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.|^q
B|And if they're if you got to go through a certification course to get where, to where you can carry it in public, then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it.|sv

B|This, this is where the question of gun control comes in.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, uh, that, that was the topic.|sd
B|What, I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Say a person, uh, uh, get,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b

B|As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade.|sd
B|And the only reason I feel comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|he, he just|%
B|any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,|sd

A|Huh.|b
A|That's really,|%
A|I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I never had them growing up,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, you know, I never really had them around me, you know,|sd
A|so I've never owned one you know, since I,|sd
B|Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're very independent,|sd

A|Huh.|b
B|But when he wants to be, uh, he's really affectionate.|sd
B|He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and, and, and snuggle up to you,|sd
B|and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.|sd
A|Huh|b

A|they just, you know, come up,|sv

A|The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.|sd

A|He did it again|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so we chained him up|sd

B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|So, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire|sd
B|Oh.|bk

A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay, uh,|b^m
B|the question was about, uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should.|sd
B|I try to walk.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, last year I would, I did it every day,|sd
B|but I've kind of, in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,|sd
B|but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier.|sd
A|I agree|aa
B|But it's just to get motivated to do it,|sd
B|and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I I do it every night.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's just to get, uh, motivated again,|sd
B|and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.|sd
B|And I was walking,|sd
B|and it got kind of dark.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I was by myself,|sd
B|and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.|sd
A|Ooh.|b
B|And, so I, I kind of got frightened,|sd
B|and I kind of use that as an excuse.|sd
B|All I have to do, is start earlier,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Right.|b
B|I haven't walked since,|sd
B|so.|%
A|It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.|sv

B|Yeah,|aa
B|it sure is.|aa
B|It sure is.|aa
B|How about you?|qo
B|Do you exercise on a regular basis?|qy
A|Um, well, I try to.|na
A|Um, I started at the beginning of this year,|sd
A|I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again,|sd
A|I'm going to be real good,|^q
A|and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, uh, aerobics classes there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they run for two months at a time.|sd
A|And you have to, you do have to pay to take them.|sd
A|And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half,|sd
A|so that was four and a half hours a week.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|And it cost sixty dollars,|sd
A|and I thought, okay, that's not cheap,|sd
A|that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|And I had a friend of mine going,|sd
A|so I was real good,|sd
A|I only missed it about three times.|sd
A|And then, oh, March came around,|sd
A|and I signed up again,|sd
A|and I got, uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I,|sd
A|and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there.|sd
A|And so that was two weeks I had missed,|sd
A|and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's once you get out of that habit you just don't, you don't get back into it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because I teach school,|sd
B|and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.|sd
B|We went in together and hired a private instructor,|sd
B|and she came to our school twice a week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I, I was,|%
B|I would go faithfully,|sd
B|and then I missed once.|sd
B|Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think, if you,|%
B|you just have to stick with it.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April,|sd
A|and this session is about to run out.|sd
A|Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes|sd
A|and some of them require me to go out of town,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone|sd
A|and I've found excuses, uh things like I had the flu last week,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but I'm fine this week.|sd
A|I could have gone Monday.|sd
A|I could have gone tonight,|sd
A|and I didn't.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I'm kind of finding excuses,|sd
A|and now it's kind of like, well,|sd
A|this is the last week.|sd
A|I'll just start fresh next week.|sd
A|But, I better better do it.|sd
A|And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.|sd
A|She started taking tennis lessons,|sd
A|and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So.|%
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah|b
B|that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like it's misery loves company.|sv
B|I don't really love exercise.|sd
B|I mean, some I,|%
B|the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,|sd

B|I don't know what the name of it is anymore.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She just enjoys it so much.|sd
B|And I don't.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I'm the same way.|sd
B|I feel good after I do it,|sd
B|but I hate it when I'm doing it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I just,|sd
B|I don't enjoy it at all,|sd
B|and she just loves it.|sd
B|So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, it's a daily thing for her.|sd
B|So, it, you know,|%
B|and it's so hard for me.|sd
B|I envy her,|sd
B|I wish I could be that way,|sd

A|I do too.|sd
B|and I have an older sister that loves running, too,|sd

B|and I,|%
B|in fact, I don't run.|sd
B|I hate to run.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something|sd
B|and that helps, you know, pass the time.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|walking is kind of boring.|sv
A|I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,|sd
A|and we try to, we used to try to get together,|sd
A|and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.|sd
A|There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And it's not as boring if you get several people|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|and you can kind of talk,|sv
A|and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,|sv
A|and the aerobics isn't too boring.|sv
A|I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. Um,|sd
A|it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I do, I do have to make myself go,|sd
A|and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,|sd
A|and after I get finished I feel great.|sd
B|Oh, it's great afterwards,|sv
B|yeah.|%
A|I mean, I can go in there,|sd
A|I can be,|%
A|like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,|sd
A|and I'll have headache and everything,|sd
A|and I get out,|sd
A|I don't have a headache any more.|sd
A|I feel great,|sd
A|and I'm just,|%
A|it's amazing how much better I feel.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then just in general, I sleep a lot better|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's right.|aa
A|and I just feel much better.|sd
A|I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,|sd
A|and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better.|sd
B|Exactly|aa
B|it does,|sv
B|it gives you energy.|sv
A|But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I'm too tired,|sd
A|or I have a headache|sd
A|or,|%
A|well, I just got over the flu,|^q
A|and I'm still kind of draggy|^q
A|so I better not go|^q
B|It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it really is.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,|sd
B|and, you know, it's silly not to,|sv
B|but, I don't know,|h
B|it's just a put off.|sv
B|I don't know why I don't do more,|sd
B|and I, and I know that it's good for my health.|sd
B|I know, you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.|sv
B|So.|%
A|Right.|b
B|There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,|sv
B|but I don't know.|h
A|It's just hard to make yourself go.|sv
A|And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,|sd
A|and I've been sweaty,|sd
A|and, and it, you know,|%
A|I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.|sd
A|So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, um, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and and, uh, get a reasonable amount of workout in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Does it cost the same for just two nights or,|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it's less expensive.|sd
B|Well, that's good, too.|ba
A|This one was only forty-five dollars.|sd
A|But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go|sd
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|So hopefully.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|it's right there,|sd
A|and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.|sd
A|They've got two different aerobics rooms,|sd
A|they have the mirrors.|sd
A|Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall|sv
A|you don't like to see how you work.|sv
A|But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.|sv
A|But,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then they hire private instructors?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And they have ceiling fans in the rooms,|sd
A|and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. Um,|sd
A|and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.|sd
A|I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I can see that would be, uh, easy.|ba
B|They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.|sv
A|Oh, yeah|b
B|Well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?|qy
A|Quite a few do.|na
A|They have probably, ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,|sd
A|and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. Uh,|sd
A|they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter,|sd
A|and I guess guys can take advantage of that.|sd
A|For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|But there's a lot more guys that do that one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,|sd
A|they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that.|sd
A|So they have big variety.|sd
A|They even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.|sd
A|I've never done that one before.|sd
A|But.|%
B|Oh, you have a pool there, too?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Oh, how nice.|ba
A|They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.|sd
A|They've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need just about.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|It's a real, it is a real nice facility.|sd
A|It's also got a full inside basketball court,|sd
A|and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things.|sd
A|But it's, it is very nice.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should.|sd
B|Now to use,|%
A|I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.|sd
A|But.|%
B|Well, does it cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to to go swimming.|qy
B|Do you have to pay for that, too.|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,|sd
A|and it's about eight dollars a month.|sd
B|Oh, that's not bad.|ba
A|No,|aa
A|not at all|aa
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|Pretty cheap.|sv
B|Um.|b
A|And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,|sd
A|but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.|sd
B|I think so too,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Well, and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
A|Hm?|br
B|People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|in fact, uh, the T I-er's families can come in on these things,|sd
A|Uh, national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|because, uh, the articles that I've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that, uh,|sd
A|what|%
A|stay, stay in line for, uh, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm, I'm sort of mixed on this.|sd
B|I think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that like England has but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.|sv
B|I think that, uh, too many, uh,|sv
B|the problem with, with right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through|sv
B|and, and I think that, I think you, you mentioned Canada.|sd
B|I think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with,|sd
B|I mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one particular, uh, setup|sd
A|Um, I see.|b
B|and that way they, they are able to reduce prices because they've, you know, it's, it's all one, one centralized thing.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I, I think that, uh, again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own, if you don't have a company supporting you in the, uh, picking up the major portion of your health insurance, the cost is almost prohibitive.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|Uh, I, I was listening, uh, on the radio the other day|sd
B|and they were talking that, something like this,|sd
B|I think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,|sd
B|they could make it, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Uh, we're currently, where I'm working now, under Blue Cross.|sd
A|I don't know what the total cost of the program is|sd
A|but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So I assume that probably the total cost is probably, three fifty to four hundred.|sd
A|They're probably picking up about half of it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And that's a pretty good policy,|sv
A|but if you had something like one of these, uh, health maintenance programs, H M O, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest. If you tried to buy something like that, I'm it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|H M O.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and they're, they're fairly expensive.|sv
B|I, I, um, I I was on an H M O, uh, up until last year and, uh, through work.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it was,|%
B|I forget how much I paid a month|sd
B|but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, the reason I, I quite was because of, uh, not because I didn't like it,|sd
B|I, I really kind of did.|sd
B|Uh, the reason I quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O|sd
B|so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, we went to the, to the, the medical insurance that we have at, here at work,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, I, uh, I like the, I like the convenience of the H M O in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're,|%
B|once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.|sv
B|You know, a lot of people complain saying well, I don't want to, uh, have to be told who I need to go to|sv
B|but, you know, if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference. Because you can, you know, if, if you find someone you really like|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|and then, we did find several good doctors.|sd
B|And, um, like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit.|sd
B|And, um, my wife was in the hospital had our, had our daughter|sd
B|and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything.|sd
A|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|Delivery room and everything.|bf
A|Yeah.|b
B|including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay|sd
B|but that was, that was still included in that that cost|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's really nice because they, you know, their, their attitude is different than, than a regular, uh, insurance, uh, health insurance, uh, the, in, in a, H M O, you know,|sv
B|they're trying to prevent a problem by, by keeping the cost down at the front end, you know, and have you come in, you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|they, they charge five dollars|sd
B|a you know, pop,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you're more willing to go in and try, to take care of a problem before it grows big.|sv
A|As to a company's benefit, to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because they don't have to worry about going in and, and paying, uh, seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That's a,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I, uh, I, I really liked it.|sd
B|We both, my wife and I both did.|sd
B|You, you don't have to worry about filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid eight percent of, of whatever.|sv
B|You just pay the, the five dollars right then|sv
B|and then you're done with it.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|But here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals, have become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,|sv
A|you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the rooms are empty.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs|sv
A|and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that. The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and, uh, it being, a four thousand dollar bill.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, they, and you know, they're also|%
B|they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are just have to be there and can't afford it|sv
B|and so they, they know they're not going to get you know, get money from them|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|so they, have to absorb it somewhere else.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|aa
A|My daughter and son-in-law had a baby, here about, uh, what,|sd
A|he'll be three in August.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And like she went in,|sd
A|she had the baby|sd
A|and she was out in two days time.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|the, the deductibles didn't apply.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And so that's one way, one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by, uh,|sv
A|okay,|^q
A|if you'll shorten your stay then we will, uh, waive the deductible.|^q
B|Right.|aa
B|Our, our insurance is, uh, is doing something similar where they're also going to|sd
A|So what movies have you seen lately?|qw
B|Well, I saw, um, lately I've seen SOAP DISH.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|Which was a,|%
B|and that was a lot of fun.|sd
B|It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things.|sd
A|Well, see that's something I want to see,|sd
B|Yeah.|%
A|that's on my list to see.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it was, it was okay.|sd
B|It was not, um, not a wonderful film|sd

A|Oh, okay.|b
B|I saw THELMA AND LOUISE. A couple of days ago, and really liked that.|sd
A|Oh, did you?|bh
B|Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|See that's also on my list.|sd
B|And it's very, it's really disturbing but a good movie.|sd
A|A disturbing movie,|b^m
A|how do you mean?|qo
B|Well, it was,|%
B|um, let's see.|^h
B|The, um,|%
B|it's, it's different,|sd
B|it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, you know, shoot 'em up kind of film.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But it's with women in it instead of men|sd
B|so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing.|sv
A|A switcheroo, huh?|bh
B|And it made me think a lot about, you know,|sd
B|you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this|sv
B|but you might not be so you know, so encouraging, of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it,|sv
B|So, that was kind of interesting.|sd
B|I've,|%
B|but I really enjoyed it.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So, I|%
A|Because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school|sd
A|and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something. Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's kind of what it was.|aa
A|but,|%
B|Right.|b
A|um, yeah.|b
B|They had started out with that,|sd

A|Before we found the shopping malls that's what we did.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on my list then.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I also saw that Madonna movie.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|It's TRUTH OR DARE|sd

A|Scandalous?|b^m
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it was kind of,|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|Madonna she's pretty trashy.|sv
A|I can imagine.|ba
B|And so it was, it was interesting|sd
A|I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is, huh?|sv
B|well, I think she kept saying that, uh,|sd
B|they talked about her,|sd
B|it, it was a film of her concert, um, tour she had taken through all, all around the world.|sd
B|And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome,|sd
B|and she, kept saying that her show was not garbage.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|It had a social message to it|sd
B|and,|%
A|You just had to find it.|sv
A|You had to wade through it and find it|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|We never quite believed that,|sd
B|so.|%
A|You never quite got to,|sv
B|I thought that was pushing it a little bit|sv
B|but, she ,|%
A|All I know about that woman is that she's an incredible marketeer|sv

B|She's rich|sv
A|Yeah,|aa

B|Yeah.|ny
B|What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it?|qo
A|Well, okay,|b
A|see, we're getting back to last year.|sd
A|That's probably the last movie I saw. Um, DANCES WITH WOLVES,|sd
A|I just adored it.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|How can I tell you.|^h
A|Um, a couple years ago, I guess, well, maybe ten years ago I, I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE|sd
A|and, so, you know, just the general theme of the whole movie was, um, pretty,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean I really liked it a lot.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess.|sv
A|Um, and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood, you know, about the American pop, Indian population,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and then everything went away for a couple years,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and now it's back again.|sv
A|And, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, um, what happened way back then.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Of course, no one will ever know.|sv
A|Really I don't|h
B|I know,|aa
B|I was,|%
B|I wondered if, uh, the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be.|qh
A|Well, who knows.|no
A|I mean it, it, it sort of showed like two different types of tribes|sd
A|like one was a warring tribe,|sd
A|and the other one was, uh, vegetarian kind of, you know, feel good tribe. You know, sort of thing,|sd
B|Right|b
A|so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Nobody can get along peacefully|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but I wonder|%
B|I thought|%
B|because they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the, the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe|sv
B|and that, you know, that was so wonderful that they done that|sv
B|and they, uh, uh, I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film,|qh
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|if it,|%
B|you know, you didn't, hear any press about that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Huh.|b
B|I thought it was a very interesting movie.|sv
A|Well, I think so.|aa
A|I, um, I have come to respect a little bit more the, uh, you know, what went on here,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but, but who knows how it's supposed to all end|qh
B|Uh-huh|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|You know on the, on the broad scope I mean, um, like if, uh, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I|sv
A|meaning to me|%
A|I think about, you know, just the meaning of, um, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms. And sort of trampling that|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, so you know it, it meant something bigger I think.|sv
A|But still it was a|sv
A|I loved the buffalo scene.|sd
A|And I thought Kevin Costner was just,|sv
A|I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every, three minutes,|sv
B|I know the|aa
A|but he's the director, you know.|sd
A|Um, but, yeah,|%
A|I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.|sv
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.|sv
B|That was, that was, it was, it was good.|ba
B|I looked at my watch only a few times, which is a good thing.|sd

B|But, uh, I, uh, I do, I do enjoy the reunions.|sd
B|The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's|sd
A|Relatives,|^2
A|right.|%
B|uh, father's.|sd
B|My mother's father's family had quite a few, uh, brothers and sisters.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, uh, from that descendants.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, a lot of those people have,|sd
B|and at time, you know, they all knew one another.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are have, uh, have died off,|sd
B|or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.|sd
A|The next generation,|^2
A|uh-huh.|%
B|And so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used to be.|sd
B|So, I think people feel less of a desire to really go.|sd
B|I know that,|%
A|why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?|qo
B|Well, I, I just think that, uh, you know, at that|%
B|when, when they were|%
B|you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot|sd
B|and or they were all in the same geographical location.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And as, as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth.|sd
B|And now when they come together it's, it's generally, you know,|sd
B|like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but that's just how it is.|sd
B|My mother was complaining last year about you know,|sd
B|it's dwindling down every year,|sd
B|you know, that's just, I think that's just|%
A|Is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes ,|qy
A|we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.|sv
B|Well, yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's, uh,|%
B|yeah,|%
B|I think that's some of it.|aa
B|But, you know, I have,|%
B|uh, I, I,|%
B|it's just the way, you know, I think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit,|sv
B|and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. Of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|Uh|%
A|It really makes an effort on, to, do this anymore.|sv
B|Right,|b
B|it requires a lot of effort to, to, to do that sort of thing.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|I mean, I, I used to enjoy going,|sd
B|I mean I still do kind of enjoy it,|sd
B|but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that I really, really enjoy seeing.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|You know, I,|%
B|it's going just for the sake of getting together,|sd
B|I think for the family.|sd
B|And,|%
A|Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.|qy
B|Uh,|^h
B|Um, um, no,|nn
B|not really.|sd
B|in that,|%
B|but, then again, uh, well, I, you know, I have some aunts that, uh, I, I, I do.|sd
B|That's about|%
B|my mother's sisters, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|but I feel closer to them, because I kind of grew up with them.|sd
B|But, But, uh, as, you know, for the rest of that group, no not really.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion,|sd
B|so, uh|%
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|you do not really feel that that really close to them.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City.|sd
A|They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer,|sd
A|but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it usually goes through me twice a year|sd
A|and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top,|sd
A|and then that's the way it's kept in order.|sd
A|And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person.|sd
A|You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.|sd
B|That's a good idea.|ba
A|So, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And that, that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, I think.|sd
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Right.|b
A|We tried to start that in my husband's family.|sd
A|His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago,|sd
A|and I said, well let's start this letter,|sd
A|and it just never|sd
A|my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us|sd
A|and that's as far as it got.|sd
A|I sent it, on to the next one,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona, for that family.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left.|sd
A|And the sister-in-law died|sd

B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b

A|He kept picking at it|sd
A|and I didn't|sd
A|the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it|sd
A|So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.|sd
A|And I told my husband,|sd
A|I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,|sd

B|Good-bye|^2
A|He loves this dog|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, how do you feel about taxes?|qo
A|Well, it seems like a big politics game|sv
A|like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election|sd
A|so he said the budget was fine,|sd
A|the state didn't have any money|sd
A|and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money|sd
A|so they raised all our taxes.|sd

B|Oh.|b

A|they just keep raising them.|sd
B|I've never seen taxes really go down.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|me neither.|sd
A|Well, actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long|sd
A|so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year|sd

B|Oh.|b
A|I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.|sv
B|I hope they put that in writing|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|they say they're going to lower,|sd

B|You think the rich are paying too much?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month, well, that's ridiculous.|sv
A|Why bother working?|qh
B|Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to,|sd
B|I mean, I'm talking about the really rich.|sd
A|Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That would be fair.|sv
B|Now I'll go along with that. You know,|aa
A|Yeah|b
A|no loopholes or anything.|sv
A|Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Now, I think that would be fair.|aa
A|Right.|b
B|And I, you know,|%
B|no, no ifs, ands and buts, you know,|sv
B|no big elaborate laws that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.|sv
B|It's just, you know, you make this, you pay ten percent.|sv
B|If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,|sv
B|if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's the way our state tax is here.|sd
A|I think it's pretty fair.|sv
B|Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.|sd
A|Oh|b
B|So, and, and you withhold no matter what you do,|sd
B|they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough.|sd
A|Oh, great,|ba
A|so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|so now, you know, when you sign your W-Four form or whatever, W-Two whatever that is, then they always say, do you want a extra amount for state. Which is ridiculous,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I guess you have to check yes|sv
A|or you come down to the end of the year|sv
A|and you don't have it to give it to them.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|unless you have a lot of deductions.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.|sv
A|Really?|bh
B|And you end up owing, you know,|sv
B|you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal|sv
B|and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state.|sv
A|Ouch|ba
B|And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.|sv
B|But, I, I don't know.|h
B|I've,|%
B|they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in, in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,|sd
A|or right now|%

A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.|sv
A|I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I agree. Uh,|aa
B|as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,|sd

A|Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite|sv

B|Yeah.|b
A|I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.|sd
A|It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.|sv

B|Yeah,|b
B|me too.|sd
B|I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.|sv
A|Huh.|b
A|I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.|sv
B|Oh, sure.|aa

B|I mean, people, like,|%

B|it's been,|%
B|I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having effective, effective punishments|sv
B|and, and they're extremely severe.|sv
B|Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because you never know if it's going to be applied. Right,|sv
B|unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand|sv
B|and  and you walk around  the rest of your life with one hand|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and everybody knows exactly what, what for.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh,  and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,|sv
B|or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,|sv
A|I mean, sure, their life is taken,|sv
A|but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,|sv
A|so I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with|sv
A|so it's more of the easy way out than making them pay for the for the you know, what they've done.|sv
B|some people,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,|sv
B|it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. To keep people in jail.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...|sd

A|and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,|sd
A|and I,|%
A|some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,|sd
A|and mine is a standard|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it had a lot more pickup and everything.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing.|sv

B|Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.|qw

A|I think of it,|%
A|I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,|sd

A|Kind of strange|sd
B|You work for a big company, then.|qy^d
A|Work for T I. Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this|no
B|T I, I see.|bk
B|Uh-huh. Um,|b
B|but yeah,|b
B|I, I, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Maybe it would,|%
B|one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.|sv
A|Oh, really.|b
B|Um, and it really saved us some big money once.|sd
A|It did, huh.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,|sd
B|and I had to pay twenty five for the,|sd
A|Oh, that was great.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it was.|aa
A|That's unusual to hear,|sv
A|usually, you know something breaks,|sv
A|you look at the warranty|sv
A|and it's excluded.|sv
B|Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.|sd
A|Oh, I see,|b
A|okay.|b
A|Oh, you got your money's worth.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we did,|aa
B|but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,|sd
B|and of course I'm glad I did it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that is good.|ba
B|But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I've been lucky.|sd
A|Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.|sd
B|Bumper?|qy
B|Oh.|bk
A|It didn't actually dent the car or anything.|sd
A|So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,|sd
B|Well, that was good.|ba
A|and the store will pay for it anyway,|sd
B|Are you.|%
A|so. No big deal.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?|qy
A|Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one|ng
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's a Legend|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|those are nice .|sv
A|um, but it's, it's a used one|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,|sd

A|it was a real old one|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|and we,|%
B|in fact, what I'm driving right now,|sd
B|we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,|sd
B|and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.|sd

A|I know.|aa
A|Yeah.|b

B|I, I,|%
B|you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know|sd

B|What do you use yours for mostly?|qw

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but I, um, I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that.|sd
A|Um, what do you find that you use yours mostly for?|qw
B|Well, I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base,|sd
B|and, uh, about the only thing|%
B|I am, uh, I'm just starting to get into, uh, a little bit more communications now.|sd
B|I've just today ordered a fax modem|sd

B|Uh, are you using windows?|qy

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it's, um,|%
A|I want, I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh.|b
B|Well, the one thing I used to use a, uh,|sd
B|I've never used an I B M actually.|sd
B|I used to use a, just an Apple two E, which of course is looks pretty primitive now.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school.|sd
B|But I don't have any, uh, any real programming capabilities on my, uh, Mac right now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't have, uh, any compilers|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I'm, uh.|%
A|Well, do you use your computer for, um, just things around the house, or in the .|qy
B|I use it in my business.|sd
A|Well, see, what do you do?|qw
B|I, uh, do, uh, consultation and, and testing of various kinds for, uh, English as a second language programs.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
A|Um, and, uh, are these like, uh, do these programs, um,|%
A|are, are they based on, on a, on a, um, other language,|qy
A|or are they based, are they based|%
A|like a lot of the, um, you know, a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of, you know, parts of the world,|sv
A|and the teacher just tries to, tries to teach English, you know, through natural understanding.|sv
B|That's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You seem to be, uh, better informed than the average person on that.|sv
A|Well, it was just, uh, when I was high school, I worked for the community school,|sd
A|and they had a English second language class|sd
A|and it always seemed strange to me that, you know, all these, all these people that, you know, spoke English not too well, and spoke, you know, a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to, you know, you don't have as many cues,|sv
A|you can't, don't have hand gestures and things like that.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Well, now, we, uh,|%
B|what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed, though.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Most of the stuff that I do is not, uh, interactive|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I use it for uh, data analysis on testing,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that.|qy^d
B|Well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, uh.|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.|sd
B|So it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I would imagine so.|ba
A|Um, so, um, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?|qw
B|Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly and with smaller files.|sd
B|I can't believe, you know, I've got, uh, five, uh, megabytes on this one now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It, it's .|%
B|and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|it's amazing, you know, how, how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much.|sv
A|I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you know, then, then we, then I started playing with Apples, you know,|sd
A|and those had forty-eight,|sd
A|or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty-four K.|sd
B|Oh, the old the old Apple, uh, the, the original Apple had, what, yeah, forty-eight I guess, didn't it.|qy
A|Uh, I know, I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them,  is all,|sd
A|and|%
B|My goodness.|ba
A|there's, I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K|sd
A|and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And you know it's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you,|%
A|I'm not sure about Macintoshes,|sd
A|but I know I B M you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, that's, that's your that's the low end. Uh.|sd
B|Well the S P thirty goes up to eight|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.|sd
B|I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.|sd
B|I don't know.|h
B|They say that system seven uses a lot of memory.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I imagine .|ba
A|Okay, Bill,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|right?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay, Bill,|bk
A|have you done much camping?|qy
B|Uh, yes.|ny
B|I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I camp, uh, every month, uh, camp at least one weekend|sd
B|and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year|sd
A|Oh, well, that, that sounds good.|ba
B|I'd say I camp quite a bit.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you do.|aa
A|Um, now do you have a lot mountains,|qy
A|well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you.|qy
A|Where do you find places to camp?|qw
B|Well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|and we, uh, we also, uh, carry all our equipment with us|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so we canoe down the river and then, sleep on the river on one of the, um, sand bars and then get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Oh, my word.|ba
A|Well that sounds adventuresome|ba
B|How about yourself?|qo
A|Well, um, I've done, oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I.|sd
A|Um, we have five children,|sd
A|and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves.|sd
A|So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,|sd
A|and we have gone up into the mountains and, uh, not necessarily roughed it,|sd
A|but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now,|sd
A|they're twelve and eleven,|sd
A|and so, they're involved in the scouting|sd
A|and they do a lot of camping with the scouts|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,|sd
A|and so this year they'll both be going,|sd
A|and so that's been real enjoyable for them.|sd
B|Great.|ba
A|So.|%
B|What, uh, what kind of camping do they like best?|qw
B|Do they like it where they have tents|qy
B|and, uh, do they cook on stoves?|qy
A|Um, yes,|ny
A|they've, well,|%
A|no,|nn
A|actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,|sd
A|and I don't think they've taken the stoves.|sd
A|Um, last year they camped in tents,|sd
A|and this year I believe they will be in tents also.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
B|It doesn't get very cold in Texas,|sd
B|so lots of times we don't even take tents.|sd
A|Oh, is that right?|bh
B|We just use trail tarps.|sd
A|Oh, and what does that consist of?|qw
B|Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh, like a, uh,|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|they're very light weight|sd
B|and we use them when we go backpacking.|sd
B|So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, uh,|sd
B|they're not very heavy, see|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so you carry them with you,|sd
B|and they'll keep you dry or whatever.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|Yes,|b
A|well, see, when, when we go camping here,|sd
A|we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and lots of tents|sd
A|and, I like to sleep on the air matresses.|sd
A|I'm not,|%
A|my bones are getting so old,|sd
A|so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that?|qy
B|yes,|ny
B|in fact, uh, um, last month we went camping,|sd
B|we saw a lot of deer uh, in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
A|My word.|ba
A|Gee.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|so, uh, but, it, even though, uh, it wasn't hunting season,|sd
B|and we were with Boy Scouts,|sd
B|so of course we don't, uh, want to go  hunting.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But we got to see a lot of deer um, out and about|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|and there's,|%
B|of course, we see smaller animals all the time,|sd
B|and, uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because, uh, we have, uh, armadillos.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|Do you know what  armadillo is?|qy
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh, they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff,|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|And possums, and, uh, raccoons.|sd
A|My word.|ba
B|And we have those creatures down here that they like to, uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And so that, that, uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.|sd
A|But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.|qy
B|They will if you attack them.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|But most time they run away from you if they, if they see you're up, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.|sd
A|Oh, my word|ba
B|So.|%
A|Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears.|sv
A|We, we want to,|%
A|Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?|qo
B|Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,|%
B|of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package|sv
B|and I think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,|sv
B|besides, they tend to offer adequate vacation, I guess.|sv
B|And the paid time off is wonderful,|sv
B|and, uh, one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered|sd
B|and I think that is just a, a fabulous one,|sv
B|so. I don't know if you participate in that or not,|qy^d
B|but|%
A|Absolutely.|ny
B|isn't it great?|qy
B|It's just a, it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up, you know.|sv
A|Well, I have to agree with that.|aa
A|You know, I was thinking about, uh, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while I was waiting for, uh, the system to find a, a respondent.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed|sd
A|and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|When I was much younger it was, uh, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.|sd
A|But as I grow older and my family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important|sd
A|and the retirement is more important.|sd
B|I had never really thought of it that way|ba
B|but I guess that's true, I guess that's true.|aa
B|I'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me|sd
B|and the paid time off is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.|sd
B|But, uh, you know, I was just, as a matter of fact, I just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, uh, kind of started looking through the, the book because of that, you know,|sd
B|now that I'm a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean and what is the pension all about|sd
B|and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,|%
B|I'm only in my late twenties now,|sd
B|so you tend not to think about retirement.|sd
B|But, uh, it's,|%
B|I guess now is the time to think about it,|sd
B|so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?|qy
A|I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.|na
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it's not, uh,|%
A|all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.|sd
B|It's not going to build up, quite enough,|sd
B|yeah.|aa
A|So, I have to find a way to supplement that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save.|sv
B|You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,|%
B|but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.|sd
B|And it's probably not a great investment,|sv
B|but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.|sd
B|I kind of have to trade off, you know.|sd
B|If you never see it you don't spend it,|sv
B|so And it's,|%
A|I understand though,|ba
A|it,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, believe me, I do that myself.|sd
B|Do you?|bh
B|Yeah?|bh
A|And I disagree with you.|ar
A|I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world.|sd
B|Do you really not?|bh
B|I, I, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.|sd
A|Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment|%
A|and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
B|That's very true.|aa
B|We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas|sd
B|and, uh, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know,|sd
B|they work up this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do.|sd
B|And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.|sd
B|We have a two year old, you know,|sd
B|and, and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,|sd
B|we have to do that now.|sd
B|And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,|sd
B|and he's two now,|sd
B|in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,|sd
B|and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to,|sd
B|it's, what it costs now is ridiculous,|sd
B|what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.|sd
B|And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college.|sd
B|And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.|sd
B|So, I guess it, you know,|%
B|in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know.|sd
B|We, we can worry about other things|sd
B|so,|%
A|I understand, that approach.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Is it really?|bh
B|Yeah.|b
A|except that mine are a little bit older|sd
A|and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,|sd
A|all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.|^q
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
B|Well, that's what she said to us.|sd
B|She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?|sd
B|And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college.|sd
B|And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.|sd
B|And that was kind of our view on it.|sd
B|It just costs too much,|sv
B|you just can't do it, you know.|sv
B|So, I don't know,|h
B|it's, it's,|%
B|I don't, uh,|%
B|it just amazing,|%
B|it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.|sd
B|I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.|sv
A|And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.|sd
A|Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,|sd
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|and I said, that's wonderful.|sd
A|I applaud that.|^q
A|Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Exactly.|ba
A|And, then her little brother's only two years behind|sd
B|Exactly.|ba
A|and he says, well, I don't know,|sd
A|I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.|^q
A|And I said, that's great.|sd
A|Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q
B|That's right,|aa
B|That's right|aa
B|Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff|sv
B|and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,|sv
B|but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go.|sv
B|I have, you know, all,|%
B|this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've|sd
B|always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms|sd
B|and so I've never had the, the big benefit package.|sd
B|So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.|sd
B|It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered.|sd
B|So, I've been real pleased.|sd
A|Well, that's fantastic,|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.|sv
B|Think so?|bh
A|Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and you can pick what you want|sv
B|and, yeah.|aa
A|now it's up to you|ad
A|it's menu selection, so, to speak.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|That sounds really good.|ba
B|I read a thing,|sd
B|I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you,|sd
B|and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea.|sd
B|You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation|sd
B|but that's really not enough|sv
B|and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year|sd
B|and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,|sd
B|and they're deducting it all along,|sd
B|so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,|sd
B|you're really not being paid for them,|sd
B|the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,|sd
B|but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.|sd
B|So, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in|sd
B|and T I said that they were looking into something like that|sd
B|so,|%
A|Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.|sv
B|Well,|%
B|true.|aa
B|True.|aa
A|Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one|sv
A|or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. Uh, as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate uh, that's running in each department.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well,|%
B|and, yeah,|%
B|and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person|sd
B|and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.|sd
B|But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.|sd
B|It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get|sv
B|so,|%
A|Well, that's for sure.|aa
B|Which is the same,|sv
B|but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,|sv
B|that's,|%
A|Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, just in this size of organization,|%
A|Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.|sd
B|Where do you live?|qw
A|I live in San Antonio.|sd
B|San Antonio!|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, I live in Garland|sd
B|and we're just beginning to,|%
B|we, we just built a real big recycling center, that recycles everything imaginable|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing, they're testing that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, they're really not full, full force into it,|sd
B|but they're trying,|sd
B|so we're attempting it,|sd
B|but I wish we could do more.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio.|sd
A|I used to work for the power company here|sd
A|and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it just wasn't cost effective,  at the time.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city|sd
A|but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign.|sd
A|There's just not any push to recycle.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I recycle my newspapers and, uh, my aluminum stuff.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|that's what I do.|sd
A|But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,|sv
A|it's not very convenient to do.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|when they put centers and stuff like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans.|sv
B|I don't know if you all have those things around.|qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
B|And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,|sd
B|and you can just stop by.|sd
B|Now everything else like the uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers|sd
B|but, but for aluminum that's real nice|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I started doing that at work.|sd
B|Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's really helped a lot,|sd
B|I mean, everybody's pitched in|sd
B|and, you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I really, I really like that,|sd
B|but, people are really concerned,|sv
B|it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which is really, really sad because, I wish we would do more|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|At work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff.|sd
B|They're really trying,|sd
B|I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,|sd
B|but, you know sometimes it dwindles down.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.|sd
B|That's good.|ba
A|But that's about the extent of it.|sd
B|Well that's, uh,|%
B|at least your trying something.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
B|It's just yeah,|%
B|it would be nice if it could be more.|sv
A|And I'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so.|sv
B|Oh do you really.|bh
A|We sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company.|sd
B|Well that's a neat idea.|ba
A|Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think.|sv
A|I,|%
A|not by much, but it does defray it some.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.|sv
B|Well that's, that's really good,|ba
B|I mean at least they're trying.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah|b
B|I know a lot of companies that waste so much that,|sd
B|I'm even trying,|%
B|you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|and I thought, I don't understand this, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff|^q
B|and, and here we are wasting.|^q
B|And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it.|sd
A|Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building|%
A|and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes.|sd
A|Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon|sd
A|and they're good boxes.|sd
B|That's exactly what I did.|sd
A|And they were just going to throw them away.|sd
B|Exactly what I did, exactly.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because I didn't want to waste that.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .|sv
A|Right|aa
A|and, and these boxes are,|%
A|you can unfold them.|sd
B|Right.|aa
A|So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space.|sd
B|Exactly right,|aa
B|well that's very good|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah|b
A|I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
A|I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them.|sd
B|I found about five, uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh gosh,|ba
B|so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes, when, you know, these are perfect,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off|sd
A|so you can't use it anyway.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Those|%
A|and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the nice lids. Those get thrown away.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|right.|aa
A|And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes.|sd
B|That's exactly what I do.|sd
A|Those are perfect boxes to put files in.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|They're good for storage and stuff like that.|sd
B|That's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store her, you know, like her out dated or, out of, out of season clothes in them|sd
B|and they're just perfect.|sd
A|What, what I've done in the past,|%
A|I don't have any now,|sd
A|but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you can stack them up and, and leave them out and put things in them, even.|sd
B|And they look just as good.|^2
B|That's a smart idea.|ba
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|aa
B|I think I'll have to try that.|sd
B|That's really cute.|ba
A|Yeah|b
A|well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.|sd
B|They're the exact same thing.|sv
B|That's all they are,|sv
B|they just made them look fancy.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|aa
B|You saved me some money.|sd
B|And you're recycling|sd
A|yeah.|aa
B|Well that's neat.|ba
B|Well do you all have, uh,|%
B|we have places that, uh, pay for paper to recycle,|sd
B|I know you do yours at work,|sd
B|but for newspaper.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But ours are real hard to find.|sd
B|That's the one thing that really discourages me.|sd
B|I saved you know, I recycle paper,|sd
B|but they,|%
B|it's almost like they don't want the paper, because they don't pay, at all,|sv
B|I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay.|sd
B|And that's really discouraging.|sd
B|I mean, I just go ahead and take it to the, the regular place, where it's, you know, they just accept it.|sd
B|But they, uh, I think they should|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|if they want people to recycle I think it's, uh, you know,|sv
B|like the aluminum, you know,|%
B|it gets people to, uh, doing it, you know,|sv
B|you might, you don't have to pay them a lot.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I live near a Walmart|sd
A|and there's a big, uh, uh, huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front,|sd
A|in fact I think there's two of them, that have several openings,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's for recycling|sd
A|and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't,|%
A|maybe there's two for aluminum.|sd
A|And you don't get paid|sd
A|but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there.|sd
B|Well that's, that's good.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|I,|%
B|the one thing I don't like about the newspaper also is, uh,|%
B|like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk.|sd
B|You have one for paper and one for just your normal trash,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but in, uh, in the paper one you have to separate.|sd
B|You have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You can't throw any of that away|sd
B|and you can't throw certain file type things away,|sd
B|and I just think it's such a hassle,|sd
B|it seems like it would be, it would be easy to take it all,|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|of course, I don't know all that about recycling|h
B|so, it probably is a hassle.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I do get tired of having to separate paper, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It gets to be, uh,|%
A|I guess you have to make it a habit,|sv
A|I mean, you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|And we had, uh, a write up in our paper, uh, this last time at work about, um,|sd
B|they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash|sd
B|and every other day they do your recycling trash.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had, uh, dumped all the trash in the same bin.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And when they were questioned about it they said well, we're running late,|sd
B|or we didn't have time to do those bins or something|sd
B|and that's real discouraging. Thinking you're sitting there working to separate it|sd
B|and then they,|%
A|And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags.|^2
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|so they're, they're really, trying to start keeping an eye out for those, you know|%
B|talking to the people again about, you know,|%
B|separate them|%
B|because that is discouraging when you, when you do that the|sv
B|It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But luckily that will all get straightened out|sd
B|and, and they'll, they'll start separating them.|sd
B|Because, I don't mind doing that,|sd
B|I feel like I'm doing, uh, doing something for the community when I'm doing that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But anyway.|%
A|Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
B|You too.|fc
A|Well, I, thank you.|fc
A|Bye,|fc
A|bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
A|I don't know what the, the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is, is change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff.|sd
A|I haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.|sd
A|I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I had a similar thing, that I've worked on cars ever since I was, uh, a kid|sd
B|And that was some time ago,|sd
B|but I've gotten to the point where, uh, the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that, uh, oh, most of the cars|sd
B|I buy, I try to buy as simple a car as possible.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know what you mean.|ba
B|So, you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs|sd
B|and most of them now, you know, you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or, or fuel injected|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|or fuel injected,|^2
A|and so there's,|%
B|so there goes the carburetor|sv
B|and if the fuel injection system breaks down,  there's  no way in the world you're going to work on that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|No|aa
A|there's no way.|aa
A|Somebody once said, uh, I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it|sd
A|and a woman asked me what that meant|sd
A|and I said that means that I can't work on it.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|basically that's it.|ba
A|You know, they've gotten so complicated  or so high tech that, uh, the guys, average guys can't really go out in the, in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs, uh.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I've got, uh, an eighty-four Chevy van that's, uh, a one ton van with a camper conversion on it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's got the, the, the good old three fifty,  standard  engine in it.|sd
A|Absolutely.|aa
B|Regular gas engine,|sd
B|and that engine I understand,|sd
B|I can, I can actually work on that engine.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I used to have, uh, Chevy van,|sd
A|it was a short van,  that  had the, the three fifty in it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  basically it, it was a motor|sd
A|and you didn't have all the other junk around it,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and  you could get to it to work on it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I had to change the water pump in that, here about a year ago.|sd
B|And it was really fairly easy.|sd
B|Take the grill out and the radiator out|sd
B|and you can just stand there and work on it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.|sv
B|Well that's true|aa
B|You're right, you know,|aa
B|by the time you've finally got down to it,|sv
B|I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went.|sd
A|Well that's kind of the way I was,|sd
A|I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went,|sd
A|and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.|sd
B|A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel|sd
B|and, uh, the,|%
B|uh, it,|%
B|after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it.|sd
B|And, uh, I bought it when we were living in Lubbock,|sd
B|when I came back here, I brought the car back here|sd
B|and, uh, I don't know, diesels got pretty unpopular|sv
B|and you couldn't sell the|sv
B|I mean, though for what you could get for one,  you might  as well drive it over a cliff.|sv
B|And, uh, the injector pump went bad|sd
B|so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it. And, uh, reinstalled that|sd
B|and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time.|sd
A|I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.|sd
B|Oh, well, it, you know,|%
B|diesels don't require mechanics,|sv
B|they require plumbers.|sv
A|Well that's true.|aa
B|And, uh,|%
A|I think the closest thing I've come to, to a diesel is, I've worked for a tractor repair shop, uh, when I was in high school|sd
A|and, uh, we used to overhaul farm tractors basically,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and  they were nearly all, all diesel,|sd
A|but as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them.|sd
B|Well the injector nozzle and stuff in, you know, the big diesel farm tractors, you know, what are about the size of your thumb,|sd
B|and|%
A|Well, yeah,|b
A|and you you can get to them.|sv
B|yeah|aa
B|you can get to them,|aa
B|and the ones in, in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with.|sd
A|Well I,|%
B|I've had a lot of good service out of that car,|sd
B|but, uh, uh, I finally gave it to my son|sd
B|and he drove it literally into the ground, you know|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|He was out at Tech|sd
B|and he, he finished it off.|sd
A|I'm, I guess you're right|aa
A|the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.|aa
A|I don't know exactly why.|sd
A|One of the reasons is|%
A|I, I'm beginning to wonder is, where do you get gas at.|qh
A|I|%
A|I don't know if it's still, uh, limited like it was,|qy^d
A|I don't notice it, probably because I|sd
B|What,|qw
B|the availability?|qy
A|Huh?|br
B|You mean the diesel availability?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I don't, I don't notice|sd
A|but maybe because I'm not looking for it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well I'd bought, uh, a G M C diesel pickup and, uh, loved that thing, you know,|sd
B|I really liked it.|sd
B|But it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, you know,|sd
B|traded it in on the Chevy van.|sd
B|But, uh, sure enjoyed it.|sd
A|But you got the, the three fifty in the van?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah|ny
B|the three fifty regular gas engine.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's what I like because, they've got plenty of power,|sv
A|and, uh, if you treat them right, they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm convinced that, uh, Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake,  years ago when  they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes.|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm convinced that the small V eight like the, the Mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes,  were  good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they had enough power pull all this weight.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  the four cylinders just don't have it.|sv
B|I think that little, the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty, in fifty-five, I think was two sixty-five, something like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Little, you know, not whole lot more than the, than the, than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirty-five or so.|sv
B|But, uh, they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred, small block four hundred that was, uh, the same block, you know, just, just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more, an.|sv
A|I think those those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it,|sv
A|but.|%
B|Well that was, uh, that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|The two little cars I've got now,|sd
B|bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple of years ago|sd
B|and, and it was normally carbureted|sd
B|and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong,  and you know changing the  plugs and stuff.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's kind of like,|%
A|the, the first, well my first car was a fifty-six Mustang|sd
A|and, uh, over the years, uh, all|%
A|I had a, uh, Dodge pickup several years ago,|sd
A|and, uh, I can't remember the size of the engine|sd
A|it was a three oh, seven or something like that,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but,  uh, I remember working on those cars,|sd
A|you'd open the hood|sd
A|and there was basically nothing in there but an engine, and a few things.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Now, you open the hood and it's scary.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes.|aa
B|The friend of ours over here, he's got, uh, sixty-five, or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,  uh, I was look under the hood of that the other day|sd
B|and like you say, you can see the road.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's amazing.|sv
A|Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to.|sv
B|You yeah, you could stand in there if you really wanted to, I guess.|sv
A|My dad's got a new, um,|sd
A|I guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety, uh, Chrysler something or other.|sd
A|It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes, front wheel drive.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And, uh, he was showing it to me|sd
A|and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean|sd
A|and, you know, you can see the three spark plugs there in the front.|sd
A|And I said well where are the other three.|sd
A|And he'd never really thought about it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  he says well, hopefully I won't have to change them, before I trade it off.|sd
A|Yeah,|%
A|it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well when they went to the,|%
B|started with the newer engines, you know,|sv
B|when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much, you know, trouble. Because the three fifty with all the, you know,|sv
B|like well, actually, I guess,|%
B|within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it.|sd
B|The three oh five was that, that,  V  eight that they put in the, the three quarter and, and half ton van.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it had all the air pump and, uh, uh, I don't know, all that, all that stuff.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|the anti-smog pumps.|sd
B|And all the anti-smog stuff.|aa
B|And, uh, boy that was, uh, really a mess back under there under the, in that van.|sd
A|And all that stuff loads the motor down.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
A|So it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things.|sv
A|But that's one good thing|sv
A|I've got a, uh, eight ninety, uh, Chevy Blazer now|sd
A|and it's got one, uh, belt on it a serpentine belt.|sd

A|Yeah.|ny
B|Got a bunch of groves in it.|qy^d
A|I haven't had to replace the thing yet.|sd
A|It looks like it would be, uh, better than having,|sd
A|I've got an, an Olds Toronado that, I think's got six belts on the sucker.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  I had to get all those off, you know, when I was replace that, uh, water pump.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And,  uh, I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck.|sv
B|You know, when one of them breaks,  it's not  the outside one,|sv
A|Oh man.|ba
B|it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering|sv
B|or something that's way back in there.|sv
A|You bet,|ba
A|everything else's got to come off first.|sv
B|Everything's got to come off.|aa

B|how many times have you done this now?|fc

A|do, do you like to cook.|qy
B|Huh, yeah,|ny
B|I really like it,|sd

A|Oh.|b
B|so  we, we definitely have different tastes,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook|sd
A|I'm pretty bad.|sd
A|My husband is really good,|sd
A|he put himself through college working in restaurants.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And, uh, he's much better cook than I am,|sd
A|so, when I was home I still cooked a lot|sd
A|and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.|sd
A|And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago|sd
A|so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking|sd
A|and the kids are thrilled,|sd
A|they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.|sd
B|Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right|qy
A|Yeah,|ny

B|one is, uh, nine months|sd
B|and the other is two and a half.|sd
A|Two and half, oh.|b^m
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,|%
A|I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it|qy
A|Or are you not at that stage yet?|qrr
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it does|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|she can  make, uh, she makes six different meals,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Oh my gosh.|ba
B|Like to have  one thing, you know,|sd
B|one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,|sd
A|Oh my gosh,|ba
A|I couldn't|sd
B|and then she makes noodles with,  uh, with,   soy sauce or whatever,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, all things.|%
A|Boy, I couldn't do that,|sd
A|I|%
B|But, um, yeah,|b
B|our favorite,|%
B|let me think,|^h
B|I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made.|sd
B|I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,|sd
B|and that was, um,  uh, scallops,  uh, scallop, um,|sd
A|What's that.|qw
A|Oh really.|b
B|it has  a French name,|sd
B|it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it|sd
B|and you pour it over rice,|sd
A|Oh yeah,|b
A|what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.|qy
B|Yeah, uh.|ny
A|Scallops Saint  something,|sd
A|or, yeah, .|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|but, uh,  it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh the scallops.|sd
A|Really,|b
A|with scallops.|^2
B|An, and it sounds sort of funny|sv
B|but it tastes really good.|sd
A|No,|ar
A|no,|ar
A|I'm from New England,|sd
A|so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.|sd
A|And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|That sounds great.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|but, uh,|%
A|I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.|sd
A|We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,|sd
A|they had, uh, a murder mystery,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  you came dressed as one of the characters|sd
A|and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  it was really fun|sd
A|and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,|sd
A|but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table|sd
A|and that kind of interrupted the game,|sd
A|so,  so I  was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good|sd
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and then you can make that ahead|sd
A|and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So that's, uh,|%
B|Yeah|b
B|that's another thing|sd
B|I have a problem with my wife,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|she,  uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.|sd
B|She likes the chicken and fish,|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|and, like  I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know,  a lot,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|so|%
A|I know,|ba
A|my husband did too|sd
A|His parents are Austrian|sd
A|and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table|sd
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|red meat, plenty of good red meat.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.|sd
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|My dad  wouldn't know what to do.|sd
A|Oh, gosh,|ba
A|so do you,|%
B|Course, she grew up Catholic|sd
B|so you know, they,  they sort of come  with the,|%
A|Oh, they did the,|%
B|there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have|sv
A|That you do,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|that's just part of it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|we didn't, my family didn't,|sd
A|but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,|sd
A|but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,|sd
A|he never,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There  was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|there were several things that he liked|sd
A|but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.|sd
A|It's just that I cooked|sd
A|so he had to put up with it|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand|sd
A|and that was soybeans.|sd
A|I tried it like once or twice|sd
A|and he just could not eat it,|sd
A|so I never,|%
A|I had,|%
A|I was limited.|sd
A|I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,|sd
A|but.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's hard to get a protein content up then|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|That's true|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|I like, I like them every now and then for a change,|sd
B|it's nice.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|some of the stuff is good,|sv
A|but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking|sd
A|Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  we had little kids at the time, you know,|sd
A|when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,|sd
A|I couldn't, I don't like to cook.|sd
A|And  I'm not really that great at it|sd
A|so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.|sd
A|So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.|ad
B|No, uh,|ar
B|he's all done.|sd
A|He's set,|qy^d
A|oh okay.|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|I set him down.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Do you like to bake at all,|qy
A|or do you, do you get into that's, that,|qrr
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we used to do that, um,|sd
B|my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.|sd
B|But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.|sd
A|Really,|b
A|no kidding.|b
B|And, um, the  sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days|sd
B|and that would be it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|then be gone.|b
A|I know,|ba
A|that's the thing about baking.|sv
A|I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all|sd
A|and I, I can do a pretty good pie,|sd
A|we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother|sd
A|and my mother taught me how to make it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,  um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,|sd
A|but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.|sv
A|We had the same kind of problem.|sd
A|If you make homemade bread,|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I mean,  it's supposed to save you money|sv
A|but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat|sv
A|It tastes so good.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um,|sd
B|you ever seen the, the starter bread,|qy
B|I can't remember what it's called,|sd
B|they call it the, um, Amish bread here|sd
B|but,|%
A|Oh, uh, yeah.|ny
B|uh, it's made  with,|%
B|you just leave it out,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|you  know, and you let it spoil sort of.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|uh-huh,|ny
A|I've heard of that, I've heard of it,|sd
A|but I've never done it.|sd
B|You know, yeah.|b
A|That sounds pretty good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it tasted pretty good, really.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh yeah.|b
B|But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad|sd
B|and then you add all these other ingredients to it,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|and then you you make the bread|sd
A|but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|right,|b
B|you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else|sd
B|and that's how they continue the thing.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|I know, it sounds, it always sounded,|%
A|I don't know how safe that was|qh
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I know it sounded strange to me too,|sd
B|I figure, well you're baking it|sv
B|so, you know, yeah.|%
A|Yeah|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,|sv

B|Nice talking to you too.|fc
A|Take care.|fc
B|Bye, bye,|fc
A|Bye.|fc
A|Well, I don't, I mean, I don't know what you think about the, subject,|qw^d
A|I'd, the, I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the, the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.|sd
A|I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody,|sd
A|and I don't know that that's not a good idea.|sd
B|That's not a bad idea|sv
B|I,|%
B|um, uh, that, you know,|%
B|they probably, need to change it somehow, uh,|sv
B|the whole system needs changing,|sv
B|we've just got too many people in there ,  and, uh,  , are putting too many, uh, people in jail that probably don't need to be there|sv
A|I agree.|aa
B|and it's another form of sentencing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But on that one thing, I, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|I agree.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|uh, I think we're getting  to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, um, majority vote.|sv
B|And that's not going to be good.|sv
A|I don't like that,|sd
A|no,|aa
B|No.|b^m
A|I  don't like that at all.|sd
A|I know my husband served on a, on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton,|sd
A|but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug conviction|sd
A|and I don't remember|%
A|he had some cocaine and it was accused of selling it,|sd
A|and I don't remember exactly how much he had|sd
A|but, uh, actually not selling it ,|sd
A|there's a difference,|sd
A|couriering it is what,|sd
A|is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier|sd
A|and,  he  was a courier.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, they, he's, he sat on that jury|sd
A|and they found him guilty,|sd
A|and they went through the sentencing phase and everything|sd
A|and, uh, you know, they were told that, you know, during the trial that this is this guy's first offense|sd
A|and he's got this clean record,|sd
A|and, and they ended up,|sd
A|the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time to crackdown here, you know,|sd
A|and it was time to do this drug thing|sd
A|and let's crackdown|^q
A|and let's really,|^q
A|and they sentenced him to fifteen years,  you  know, which they thought first offense, okay, this is, they thought that that was, that was a good thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they sentencing him to fifteen years|sd
A|and, um, after it was all over, uh, the they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers, to someone in the let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers|sd
A|and they were told that, uh, he would probably serve three,  of  the fifteen,  and  that he had three previous convictions.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|However, they could not tell the the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|So, the jury didn't know about it,|sd
A|so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,|sd
B|Sure .|b
A|and  so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson|sd
A|but it's not just, you know, horrible,  since  it was first offense|sv
B|Yeah .|b
A|and he'd been convicted three times before, you know,|sd
B|Oh .|b
A|and,  and the jury was very upset|sd
A|and my husband came home, a home, very upset,|sd
A|I mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked, you know,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and  so something,|%
A|I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.|qh
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the judge might know|sv
B|or at least it, it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,|sv
B|if it didn't we can come back for something else|sv
B|or,|%
A|That's true.|aa
A|That's very true.|aa
B|or, or what we've got,|%
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, we definitely need a change in the system|sv
B|and, uh,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|obviously what we are doing is not working, you know.|sv
B|It's not working, too .|aa
A|No.|aa
B|It's just piling up on us.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and there's, you know, there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and  either they're in there,  forever  or when they get out they're, you know, it's a matter of a few months|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and they're going to be right back for the same thing|sv
A|so the system,|%
B|We're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes,|sv
B|so.|%
A|That's very true.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day|sd
A|and I said, you know, I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States, to|sd
A|and,  and  the, and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,|^q
B|Right.|b
A|I  mean, we,|%
A|and, and|%
A|I know people say, oh, it would be cruel to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries|sv
A|and, and maybe so,|sv
A|so tell them, you've got five years. To work out a plan, to make it on your own.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, we will continue funding you for the next two years,|^q
A|after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy you know, seventy-five percent.|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,|^q
A|and in five years, it|^q
A|by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help.|^q
B|Sure.|aa
A|And then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to,  to  work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and we're trying to,  heal the world,  you know,|sv
B|Very serious, yeah.|aa
A|it's just not,  it's just  not working.|sv
B|Oh, yeah ,|b
B|your right , .|aa
A|I look at the, I look at what, you know, what, the aid presented to the Kurds|sd
A|and I, I feel sorry for them|sd
A|and I know they're suffering|sv
A|and I know they're dying everyday,|sv
A|but we've got, you know, kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too. You know, and being,  abused  and neglected|sv
B|Sure.|aa
B|Oh .|b
A|and, you know, I don't know.|h
A|I just have this problem with,  uh, trying  to heal the world when you're so sick yourself, you know,|sv
B|You bet .|ba
A|so.|%
B|Right.|aa
B|Well, we seem to agree on the jury thing|sv
B|and, uh, but, uh , we'll need an unanimous verdict|sv
B|and,  maybe  let the judge have a opportunity to make,  a decision .|sv
A|Yep.|aa
A|I think  we should try it, like you say,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|if  it doesn't work, we can always come back,|sv
A|but I think it would be a good idea to try it.|sv
B|I do too.|aa
A|So, anyway,  well, we all agree.|sv
B|Well, good.|ba
B|Good to hear from you.|fc
A|You too, bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|So I own a, a P C A T at my home.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,|sd
B|I mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,|sv
B|well, who is this,|qw
B|what do you use yours at home for?|qo
A|Well, that's actually a good question.|arp_nd
A|My wife works out of the home, our home.|sd
A|She has an office|sd
A|and in fact she sits in the office|sd
A|and she uses it to compose and print out letters.|sd
B|Okay,|bk
B|well now.|%
A|So that's a very regular use of it that she has.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And in addition to that I tinker around with it.|sd
A|I'm a computer scientist.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|And so I write programs to do little things|sd
A|I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.|sd
A|And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.|sd
B|Uh, huh, well, excuse me, I, uh, uh, well I'm a technician, electronics tech.|sd
B|Years ago T I sent me to their, uh, computer school down in Austin.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, I learned to repair one|sd
B|but you know I never really learned to operate one.|sd
A|Oh, that's a key thing.|sv
A|Well, actually that's a,|%
A|there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today. That just require no programming.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|So that|%
A|in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming|sv
A|but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think you you really hit the nail on the head.|sv
A|For the average person is exactly what he can use it for.|sv
A|And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters|sv
A|or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,|sv
A|whatever|sv
A|there, your issue is then there really,|sv
B|Well, uh, space is a handicap with me,|sd
B|I live in a motor home.|sd
A|Oh, I see|b
A|well.|%
B|And I'm preparing for retirement.|sd
A|I see|b
A|well, congratulations on that.|ba
B|And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|definitely,|aa
B|but just like the computers.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Oh, the calculators you mean.|bf
B|I mean calculators,|na
B|I beg your pardon.|fa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they sure do.|aa
A|Yeah|aa
A|I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.|sd
A|You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.|sv
B|You're kidding.|bh
A|No.|nn
B|Including a printer?|qy
A|Well, actually I wasn't including a printer,|arp_nd
A|but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars|sd
A|so make it seven hundred.|sd
B|A hundred?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Wholly smoke,|ba
B|a respectable one?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,|sd
B|but I'm, I'm, that does amaze me.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|the prices had plummeted,|sd
A|you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,  the  box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|And then the keyboard is another fifty,|sd
A|the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred|sd
A|and then the disk drive is two fifty.|sd
B|Well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive.|qy
A|Well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,|arp_nd
A|you're buying these knock offs,|sd
A|so there's,|%
A|probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's a big magazine,|sd
A|it's twelve inches narrow, the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.|sd
A|But the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses|sd
A|and they're all competing with each.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer|sd
A|that that's called, it's the original P C.|sd
A|So it's,|%
A|we call the T I, I'm sorry an I B M P C compatible.|sd
A|And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.|sd
B|Uh.|b
A|And you mix and match|sd
A|and then you do it by mail-order.|sd
A|But there's no real brands|sd
A|it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.|sd
B|I see.|bk
B|How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?|qo
A|They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that that type of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.|sd
A|And like I said it's about an inch thick|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well, getting back to the P C|sd
B|I'll tell you,|^h
B|I ya,|%
B|first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.|sd
B|And secondly, I did learn this much about computers,|sd
B|they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.|sd
B|In binary.|sd
A|That's right|aa
A|There's great.|ba
B|Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.|sd
A|Oh, yeah|b
B|One and one equals ten.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's great.|b
B|Course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.|sv
A|I understand,|ba
A|that's great,|ba
A|that's a good joke.|ba
B|So what,|%
B|do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?|qy
A|I did for years|na
A|and then I was a scientist over in central research labs|sd
A|and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, now I I type that one,|sd
A|but I don't use it anymore.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well I just recently started using one.  In  connection with my work.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|Uh, I keep track of an inventory here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|I agree.|aa
B|And, well I, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|See I'm with the Q R A lab. Qualification and evaluation|sd
A|Oh, I see|b
A|that's fascinating.|ba
B|so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  they're dated.|sd
B|So I have to keep up with them, uh,|sd
B|and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I just run a printout every week|sd
B|and and it puts me right up-to-date what I'm, what I have to do, what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So a,|%
B|it it is handy.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I must admit that up until I did start using one, uh, it was, I had very little interest in computers.|sd
A|Yes|b
B|But they are amazing.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they certainly are.|aa
A|So let's see, see|^h
A|so I guess with respect to the question,|sv
A|yeah,|%
A|I guess we've kind of covered it.|sv
B|I think we did.|aa
A|Great,|ba
A|nice little conversation with you Jack.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|Mike you take care now.|fc
A|Good day.|fc
B|Good luck  to you.|fc
A|Thank you.|fc
A|Same to you.|fc
A|Uh, I guess I've had to return something|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|but I'm can't decide,|sd
A|mostly it's been because I didn't like the color,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or,  um, I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things, uh,|sd
B|Well, I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned.|sd
A|Oh, are you?|bh
B|So, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|good,|ba
A|so, we'll talk about that some.|ad
B|Yeah,|aa
B|well, we could talk about that,|oo_co_cc
B|and then we could talk a bit about, um, just quality of products in general,  if  they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that.|oo_co_cc
A|Right.|b
A|Okay,|aa
A|I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack,  because  you sound like you're,|ad
A|let me tell you just a little bit about myself.|^h
A|I, for years I did all that shopping and whatnot,|sd
A|but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and  I've had two cornea transplants.|sd
A|Shopping is no fun anymore|sd
B|I can imagine.|ba
B|Well, see I don't,|%
A|I can't see good enough, you know,|sd
A|and, uh, it's hard to tell what I'm doing,|sd
A|and it's just|sd
B|You can't read labels|qy^d
B|and you can't,|%
A|Oh, I just thought of something we have to return|sd
B|Good.|ba
B|There you go.|ba
A|All right.|b
A|It, it'll come to us,|sv
A|okay?|qy
B|Okay.|na
A|Are you ready?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Laurie, all right|b
B|Right.|b
A|All right, uh,|b
A|tell me about your computer, Laurie,|ad
A|I think that sounds fascinating.|sv
B|Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project,|sd
B|and we called up the company and asked them details on it.|sd
B|We bought it sort of, your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with,|sd
B|and they were very happy with the system,|sd
B|and they felt they've gotten a good price.|sd
B|And we went in,|sd
B|we explained what we needed|sd
B|and yes|ny
B|we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to get, to meet these people.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so we went there,|sd
B|we told them about the stuff|sd
B|and the guy said, uh, that the computer would fit our needs.|sd
B|And we|%
B|these things won't make any sense to you probably|qy^d
B|but he told us there were,  we  need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, yes.|b
B|And it's called a user boards|sd
B|or slots is what it's called.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit, sorry, two four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user,|sd
B|and we can put full size cards in there.|sd
B|And so we said, great, you know,|sd
B|we'll buy it,|^q
B|and we put in our order.|sd
B|And a week later we went back and picked up the computer.|sd
B|And then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it|sd
B|and there's only one slot we could put it in.|sd
A|Oh, lovely.|ba
B|And at this point we only have one board|sd
B|so it wasn't so bad|sd
B|so we used it a bit,|sd
B|but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And,|%
A|Oh, no ,|ba
A|the computer was supposed to have two.|qy^d
B|Well, it has them|arp_nd
B|but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it, in it. And even though they told us in advance that you could,|sd
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|they told us there would be no problem because, you know,  the salesman  just doesn't really know.|sd
A|I see.|b
A|In some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it.|sv
A|They probably didn't know what they were talking about.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|That's completely it.|aa
B|The salesman didn't know.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|So, we went back in,|sd
B|and we struck an agreement with the people|sd
B|who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Okay.|b
B|So they did that.|sd
B|And we said are you sure this will work,|sd
B|we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,|^q
B|and they're, they were doing it at their own costs.|sd
B|And so we said, fine.|sd
B|And we went back|sd
B|and we talked to the person a second time and things like that,|sd
B|and then we come, we get the computer home,|sd
B|my husband goes to pick it up last week|sd
B|and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby,|sd
B|and  you  know, life's just a little bit complicated.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh .|b
B|And, uh, he goes and gets it, brings it home,|sd
B|first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out.|sd
B|And then second thing, we still can't put the boards in,  because they  have other things blocking where we need to do it.|sd
A|Oh, jeez .|ba
A|Huh.|b
B|And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again|sd
B|and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors|sd
B|and we hope so,|sd
B|but it's a hassle.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it really is.|aa
B|You you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I think that's the worst part.|sv
A|I,|%
B|So, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card|sd
B|and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,|sd
B|and they said, well, you don't have to pay for it yet.|sd
A|Now that's an advantage, isn't it?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|It really is.|sv
A|I think, uh, uh, there's a lot not to be said for credit|sv
A|but that's one thing to be said for credit.|sv
A|It, how ,  it  gets you some muscle where you need it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|So, and so, you know,|%
A|And I think that's really important.|sv
B|Well, because these guys if they, um, give us a hard time we're going to say, you, look, you know,|sd
B|if, if you can't fix this to our satisfaction,  we're  just returning the computer.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|And if we do that,|%
B|I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge,  even though  they've already paid it.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|No .|aa
B|But they'll just, you know,  undo the credit  that they did to them.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|they will,|aa
A|That's right.|aa
A|They will,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|they  will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,|%
A|We,|%
A|Hal bought me, uh, uh, small, uh, well, uh, uh, little jam box kind of thing|sd
A|so I'd,|%
A|my, I have my ninety-three year old mother living with us,|sd
A|and so I, she doesn't remember anything|sd
A|but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I thought well, if I had, uh, a a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. And then also so that I can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, I, I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace so I figured well this will be good.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, the first, uh, uh, the first time I turned it on, uh, I was recording,|sd
A|and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the,  thing.|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|Okay,|%
A|so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then on the other side, when I, when I, uh, I loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to, uh, to, uh, videotaping they were doing,|sd
A|and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far,|sd
A|and so you can't, you can't get it to run the right, the right way,  either,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, uh,|%
B|What brand is it?|qw
B|Do you know?|qy
A|Yeah,|b
A|so I, I wish I could tell you|^h
A|I really don't know which brand it is.|ng
A|It's ,|%
B|But I was wondering like, you know|sd
B|in our case where we knew we were buying a copy|sd
B|we weren't buying,  on  I B M P C|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I was wondering if you,|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I think this is a, I think this is maybe a name brand|sd
A|and I suspect that it's probably just a fluke, you know.|sv
A|I have the papers and everything|sd
A|and we're going to get, just take it back|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you buy it at some major store?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I think just, uh, just, uh, one of the major, I think it was a, you know, I don't, I think it was, uh, you know, like a Highlands or something like this.|sd
B|Highlands|b^m
B|chain down there that I don't know up here.|sd
A|Do they have Highlands up there?|qy
B|Nope.|nn
A|Don't they?|bh
A|Well, this is, is was a regular, uh, electronics store, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I don't think, I don't think there will be too much problem|sv
A|but I, I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well.|sd
A|I think they deliberately sometimes, um,|sv
B|I think a lot of things are not made as well.|sv
A|Don't you?|bh
A|What, what, for instance, what are you,|qw
B|Um, oh,|%
B|of course, it's hard to think of an exact example,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but  I think that, um,  I|%
A|That's good|ba
A|they're getting a kind of a, attitude of,  not,|%
B|yeah,|b
B|I just have , well, I like electronic stuff,  you  know|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|for one thing. I know their, work, you know,|sd
B|cars I think are not made,  as  well as they could be.|sv
A|Well,|%
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
B|Um,|%
A|I  think that's right.|aa
A|The fact that,|%
B|because I ,|%
B|they want people to replace it after,  a  couple of years.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|The fact that they, that they have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes, uh, dwells on a fact that, you know, uh,|sv
A|I've had, I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, they may cost a little more,|sv
A|but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I had a Toyota|sd
B|and I loved it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|My Toyota did,  really well.|sd
A|It does the,  it did a good job,|sv
A|so, part of it is that we need to develop more of a, of a pride in, in, uh, the kinds of things we do so we make them better.|sv
B|Good.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
A|And it kind of has to start from the top and, and go or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.|sv
A|People,|%
B|Well, I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.|sv
B|The people just don't care about,  what  they're doing.|sv
A|No.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, the whole,|%
B|nobody cares, no, nobody's,  really  paying,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Attitude is, is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do, and,  on,|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|give me  my paycheck, so I can go home.|^q
A|what I'm doing, right.|sv
A|I think that's too bad.|sv
A|And it's a shame too because, uh, when you get right down to it most things, there isn't any, if you do a good job, nobody can pay you enough|sv
A|There isn't,  any  way to get paid enough.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But if you do a good job, you feel enough satisfaction,|sv
A|so whatever you're paid is enough.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and also I think,|%
B|well, I do research|sd
B|and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, and you get satisfaction out of it.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
B|And,  But I think a lot of it, you know, I think things come both from the, uh, individual side and also from the company side|sv
A|I  think they underestimate how much, how much value the satisfaction|sv
B|because the companies that, let, give the attitude that, well, you know,|sv
B|you're the last one hired|^q
B|so you'll be the first one fired,|^q
B|and  we just want you to do your day's work,|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  we don't really care about you,  as  an individual.|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|When you've got that type of attitude on it, the people don't care,  about  their work.|sv
A|No .|aa
B|And so,|%
A|It it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately.|sv
A|Starts with the one person that, you know,|sv
A|and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay, you know.|sv
B|Little value just in whatever you do.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|The, the, the that the value is in doing it well|sv
B|Doing a good job of it.|sv
A|and,|%
A|Well, we, uh,|%
A|taxes,|%
A|everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure.|sv
A|But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases.|sv
A|What do you think?|qo
B|Uh, yeah,|aa
B|I, I think so.|aa
B|I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something|sv
B|and I don't know what to cutback on to,  to get, to get that,  to get that settled.|sd
A|At this stage it's  hard, to tell.|sv
B|And, and, uh, and, uh, I know I'm a real, a real, uh, out of it in terms of taxes|sd
B|so I'm I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas|sv
B|and, and,|%
A|Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because,  like the, the property  taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I think so.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I know|sv
A|I live in Richardson|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals|sd
A|and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I,|%
B|we'd, when we moved to Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that,  because  we supported the,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,|sv
A|and the public,  colleges  also, the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|one  of the,|%
A|uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition.|sd
A|Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think that's right.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
A|That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount,|sv
A|but I eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.|sv
B|I, I don't, I don't know about that,|ar
B|I, I,|%
A|Yeah|b
A|Well, I quit ten years ago|sd
A|so I,  I couldn't afford to start  again|sd
B|I see.|b
B|Okay.|b
B|No, uh,|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, that, that, that would be true.|aa
B|That would be true.|aa
B|But,|%
A|I know, uh,|sd
A|my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know.|sv
A|Well, this, this is a thing|sv
A|I think it's like, uh, back east.|sv
A|You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities.|sv
A|You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.|sv
A|If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that,  and  had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and, uh, construction costs were cheap, you could afford it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But now,  digging  tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive.|sv
B|And,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.|sv
A|Absolutely.|aa
B|Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.|sv
B|And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown,|sv
B|uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area. You know, like New York does,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|yeah.|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|New York|%
A|and some,  people  don't even own a car and know how to drive a car.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.|sd
A|An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.|sd
A|Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|right.|b
A|And, uh, most people are that way. Because they're used to not having public transportation.|sv
B|Yep.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, but I,  here  again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt. So and doing all these studies and the things|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.|sd
A|I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.|sv
B|A little bit much.|aa
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Yep.|aa
B|Yep.|aa
B|Oh, the|%
A|Well, that's about all I can say at this time.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|I I think so,|fc
B|I think that will probably do it,|fc
B|so.|%
A|Okay,|fc
A|it's been real nice talking with you.|fc
B|Good enough.|fc

A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, do you own a P C by the way?|qy
A|I'm guessing you probably do.|qy^d
B|I don't have one in my home here.|ng
B|My, um, parents have one|sd

A|Right.|b
B|They're in Richardson.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|And what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?|qw
B|Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And we got,|%
B|uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,|sd
A|Great.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so we use those|sd
B|and there's some,|%
B|whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game,|sd
B|so, that's part of it.|sd
A|Oh, sure.|b
B|Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. Uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, I tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh,|b
B|I'm, uh,|%
B|my father had a software company,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, they're kind of old older|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Um, I I'm a, a writer by profession|sd
A|and, uh, when, when I was first here in, in Dallas or in Plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because I thought, oh, they're so wonderful.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|I have one of those.|sd
B|Yeah.|%
A|Well, then, um,|%
B|Mine's broke at the moment,|sd
B|but|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|ours really needs to have some work done on it|sd
A|but, but then my husband, um, worked at T I|sd
A|and I got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, but he got a, um, uh, the, the T I professional and brought that home|sd
A|and I learned Wordstar on that,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh,|sd
B|I did some typing for my father when he had the company|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so I learned that on there too,|sd
B|that was,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect?|qy
A|Or,|%
B|I haven't.|ng
B|That's the one that my father,|sd
B|well, I guess I have used it once or twice.|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|He's got on I B M.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That's probably where you've used it.|sv
B|And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah. Um,|b
A|I have that on my, uh, computer here|sd
A|and also, um, I do some work at U T D|sd
A|and, uh, that's what they have there|sd
A|and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software.|sd
A|And, um, I don't know from my own experience, um,|sd
A|WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have.|sd
A|It may be improved by now|sd
A|but,|%
B|That's what I've heard.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's, uh, Wordstar was never very intuitive to me.|sv
A|I mean you know, you,|%
A|some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the computer|sv
A|but, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you had to, memorize it,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|And, but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways.|sv
A|And you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. Because it keeps track of all your footnotes.|sv
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh, that's neat.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.|sd
B|Oh, how wonderful.|ba
A|So, you know, it's just,|%
B|That, I had heard that that was better. That was a better one.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|aa
A|And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything,|sd
A|and oh, it was just awful.|sv
A|So, um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled.|sv
A|But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I agree|aa
A|So, um, well, I have not really paid much attention because I|sd
A|clock,|%
A|although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes|sd
A|so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C|qy^d
B|Not too much.|ng
B|What kind of, what kind of things do you write?|qw
A|Well, um, I was a technical writer for many years, um,|arp_nd
B|Oh|bk
A|and my husband and I actually met in a computer company.|sd
A|Um, I was a tech writer|sd
A|and he was an engineer. And, uh, so I did tech writing for a number of years.|sd
B|to her Go talk to Daddy about it.|t3
B|Excuse me.|ad
A|Oh, sure.|aa
B|to her Go on and talk to Daddy about it|t3
B|Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you.|t3
B|But you don't need to drag it down the hall|t3
A|Got a problem, huh?|qy
A|Um,|%
B|Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged|sd
A|Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|But, um, I have,|%
A|um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, I have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.|sd
A|And, um, for a while I had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist.|sd
A|So I did some advertising and P R|sd
A|but,|%
B|Huh.|b
A|um, now I'm, actually I'm, I'm not working anymore.|sd
A|I'm a student, I'm a graduate student|sd
A|so I'm doing a lot of writing|sd
A|but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I've done a little, a lot of different kinds,|sd
A|but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers|sd
A|so that's been really great.|sd
A|And, uh, I'm, so I'm real spoiled.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm anxious some day to have one here.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm,|%
B|and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again|sd
B|so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,|sd
A|Good.|ba
B|so.|%
A|That's great.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|I've,|%
A|Well, those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on|sv
A|and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|So, um, I think that that would be a real, a real, uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, uh, do it early,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|so. Uh, do|%
B|We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.|sd
A|Oh, neat.|ba
B|And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type|sd
A|Right|b
B|So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.|sd
A|That's great.|ba
A|Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life,|sv
A|so Might as well start now, huh?|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|yes.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|Well, Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly.|fc
A|This is really going to be fun I think,|fc
B|Yeah.|fc
A|and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator|fc
A|and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the,|fc
A|Well, Steve, did you go to college?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|In fact, I'm still going.|sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
A|So you probably could give some great advice.|qy^d
B|Uh, well, I don't know about that,|arp_nd
B|but I, in fact, I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, what's your what's your interest,|qw
A|your, uh,|%
B|Uh, well, computer science and cognitive science.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|That, that's similar to what,|%
A|I'm in a P H D program right now.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|And, uh, my area of expertise, it's information systems, which is a little bit less technical, I think, than, uh, than computer science.|sv
A|But my area of expertise is, uh, uh, human computer interaction.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, uh, because it's of, I'm working with voice systems.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
A|So, so, good luck.|ba
A|I guess we should talk about giving advice, though.|ad
A|what, what type of advice do you think you'd give to a, a parent?|qw
B|To a parent?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, you know, the thing is, when you're a kid and the kid at that age, especially if they're going into undergraduate, it seems like they think they know what they want.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|An, and, I mean, choosing from my experience, you know, I thought, you know, my, I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I don't know,|h
B|at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school,|sv
B|you know, the size of it or,|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I I know very few people that, uh, started in one field and stayed with it.|sd
A|You know, they,|%
A|I think that's what you just said, you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,|aa
A|I think that's much more important.|sv
A|I, I think I'd, I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school, though, that has a number of different types of programs, you know,|sd
A|that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer,|sv
A|but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, I guess around three or four thousand students have a, can offer a broader range of curriculums and things,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so if the kid does change, they don't have to transfer,|sv
A|or they don't have to, uh, uh,|sv
A|I don't know, they don't have to give up years of, you know, of credit transfer and things.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's disruptive.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I normally,|%
A|and, and parents hate to hear this, you know,|sv
A|because I, I actually teach college,|sd
A|I hate to, uh, I hate to talk to the parents|sd
A|because, um one of the reasons is because, you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want,|sv
A|and I always say make sure you major, in something that you like, even if it's not going to be your career vocation, because you'll get better grades.|sd
A|I, I think most employers would probably rather hire, you know, a, a three six in, um, in history, uh, to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Does that make sense?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Well, yeah,|ny
B|I see what you're saying.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I always, you know, tell them that you should major in something you, you're going to get good grades in. Because that, that's always, I think, more important, you know, overall.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't know.|h
B|Uh, give me five minutes.|t3
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, you, you're at the office now?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|At work?|qy
A|Yeah.|%
B|Yeah.|qy
B|I'm just getting ready to go to lunch|sd
B|Uh, yeah,|%
B|that's like what we were saying, though,|sv
B|would you, uh, advise a private school, or a public school,|qy
A|I would, I would, it would,|na
B|you know, what's the trade off there,|qw
B|what,|%
A|I, I tell you,|^h
A|I live in Maryland,|sd
A|and the public schools here are, pretty good.|sd
A|I teach at a public school, actually,|sd
A|and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public a lot of the private schools.|sd
A|And, um, I actually, I would full time at a, at a public school,|sd
A|and then right now I'm teaching part time at a private school, at a Catholic institution.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And, um and I really think, I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,|sv
A|and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated,|sv
A|where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are public, are, are college educated,|sv
A|and I don't, I think because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,|sv
A|they're not,|%
A|it, it's the minimal cost.|sv
A|But I think you can get a good education at public or private|sv
A|but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,|sv
A|I|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|you have to really, you have to look around at the school.|sv
A|I, I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|I think, uh, I would agree with that.|aa
B|In fact, the thing that, I'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school, I was trying to choose .|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, a particular institution might be better for my area|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|yet, like, say, you know, the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something, might have some top specialists in my area.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Yet, if I go to U of I or C M U or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,|sv
B|but it's the same thing,|sv
B|there's, you know, what will the name recognition, get me, kind of thing.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|does it have a big ten football team|qh
A|or,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|That's that's usually the basic criteria.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I mean, uh, yeah,|aa
A|is it a PAC ten school, you know.|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I think,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|see, I'm, I'm at the University of Maryland, so in this, this region, um, though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland, my diploma will still say University of Maryland.|sd
B|Oh .|b
A|Um, you know, it doesn't, doesn't differentiate on my diploma, though I would put it on my resume, what program I went to.|sd
A|But I, I think, you know, I'm actually at a smaller program,|sd
A|I'm not at the the big College Park campus, you know,|sd
A|that's the big one with the football team.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So I, I think, um, I think you're right, that there's a lot of, there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition.|aa
A|Um, you know, when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, you know, in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast as, as, you know, one step below M I T in a sense, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and technical people know that.|sv
A|But I|%
A|yeah,|%
A|I think you're right,|aa
A|you really have to think about that for the job.|sv
A|I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's,|sd
A|and when I,|%
A|now, I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs,|sd
A|I was going to be a teacher,|sd
A|I was just a high school teacher,|sd
A|so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you know, but then when I went, um, for graduate work, you know, or for a new job, people said to me, you know, Shippensburg State, where is that, you know|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
A|And, you know, when I went into higher education, even at other universities, they weren't aware of it, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So I think yeah,|sv
A|that's important,|sv
A|um, I think it depends on if you want to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,|sv
A|you need that first, job or so out of school, too.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I, I guess another thing that concerns me is, uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that job market talking to someone else in|sv
B|and, uh, um, where was I at?|qw
B|Oh, in going to school, you get taught the things you learn in school,|sv
B|but there is also a whole other dimension, I mean the growing up while you're going to school part.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|And, uh, actually, in the Midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like University of Missouri, will have a main campus like Columbia, which is big, multi disciplinary,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and they'll have a satellite campus in a, usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field.|sd
B|So you've really, uh, I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|depending on your technical areas.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
A|I could see that.|ba
A|But, you know, at some of the large schools, I know that at, at, at University of Maryland where I am, you know, in a P H D program, I, I haven't even met, uh, someone outside of my area of information systems except for,|sd
B|Does your family normally have a reunion?|qy
B|Do you have one,|qy
A|Well,|%
B|that's  been,|%
A|on my father's side we've really there, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|On my mother's side we've had several,|na
A|not,  it's  not really on a regular basis,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but usually sometimes every few summers.|sd
A|Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So they're pretty much just reunited always|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.|sd
B|Well, it might be a good time for you to to, to start a tradition.|ad
A|I know,|aa
A|that's|%
B|You could be responsible for that yourself.|ad
A|do that,|%
A|that's true.|aa
B|Sure.|b
A|How about your family?|qo
B|Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual  uh,  reunion.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|you're,  a pro at this.|sv
B|The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.|sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,|sd
B|and they come as far away from California,|sd
B|and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.|sd
A|And then where do you meet?|qw
B|Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Do you have relatives in Vernon then?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Okay.|bk
B|Right,|na
B|uh-huh.|ny
B|A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died|sd
B|and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|So we're talking about second and third great children here.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year,|sd
B|they're grown and gone from home now|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so they, they take their family.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, uh, let's see,|^h
B|that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,|sd
B|okay,|%
B|so it would be the second great grandchild.|sd
B|And so they,|%
A|Okay,|b
A|so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,|qy
B|Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.|arp_nd
B|It's,  a  great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.|sd
B|Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,|sd
B|and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,  that have  been handed,  down for years|sd
A|Potato salad and, uh,|qy^d
B|Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.|arp_nd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|And we choose to bring congealed salad.|sd
B|You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,  as  opposed to potato salad.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,  whatever  you've got to carry for any distance.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I always, take home baked bread.|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family.|sd
B|I do other things very well,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|but  there are others in the family who do them better.|sd
A|Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,  so  that's what they get to cook.|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions,|sd
A|so I learned a lot about them.|sd
A|I haven't,  been  to a lot,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but we talked,  a  lot about the, the rituals,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you all equated the family reunions as,  with  the Protestant.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was, it was an interesting theory.|sd
A|She talked about the, uh, the Catholics|sd
A|all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway,|sv
A|so you usually are living where your parents live|sv
A|and it's all,|%
A|your, you don't have to come home,|sv
A|so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,|sd
A|but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became  their version of the pilgrimage.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|But she had,|%
A|it was interesting, you know,|sd
A|I don't know how valid it is,|sd
A|but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement.|sd
A|Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year?|qy
A|Is there kind of a, you know,|qy
A|salads go first and things like that?|qy
B|Well, it's, uh,|%
B|we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,|arp_nd
A|Right.|b
B|and  they plan the reunions,|sd
B|the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer.|sd
B|Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.|sd
A|Well, that's pretty .|ba
B|We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,|sd
B|and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.|sd
B|And it keeps the family alive,  even, you know, even  though it's very fluid.|sd
A|Sure does.|aa
A|That's wonderful.|ba
B|And they're very dedicated to that,|sd
B|and, uh, it's been really wonderful.|sd
B|It helps you hang onto your roots.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I wish we'd,|sd
B|And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.|sv
B|My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.|sd
B|His family was very scattered and very diverse.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I asked him, I got to talking to him,|sd
B|I said, well, how is his nephew doing.|sd
B|"Well, I don't know,|^q
B|I haven't,  talked  to my brother in three years."|^q
B|I said , "Well, how's your brother doing?"|sd
B|"I don't know."|^q
B|Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think,|^q
B|but I don't.|^q
A|Right.|b
B|I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"|sd
B|"Yeah,|^q
B|but I'm, you know,|^q
B|it's too much trouble."|^q
B|So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family. And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|You're just, uh,|%
A|Oh, that's incredible.|ba
B|Liked to kill me, because I it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,|sd
B|I did,  it  by myself.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes.|sd
B|We had a great big fish fry,|sd
B|and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.|sd
A|Right|b
B|And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.|sd
B|And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them|sd
B|and I told him,|%
A|Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?|qy
B|We did it that year,|sd
B|and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.|sd
B|We sent invitations.|sd
B|We said, "Please let us know if you're coming."|sd
B|It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|and  it,|%
B|his mother was alone, and so they came to support her,|sd
B|and then one by one, his you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,|sd
A|See, that's|%
A|we've we had a problem with that.|sd
B|and it was difficult to hold them together.|sd
B|And then, of course, he died two years ago,|sd
B|so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.|sd
A|Oh.|bk
B|And, uh, it,|%
B|I think that's what happens when they get scattered,|sv
B|the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|That's our,  was our problem.|sd
A|We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so it kind of wound down,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and  then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else|sd
A|so that,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.|sd
B|They'll send out news bulletins.|sd
B|Two or three times a year you'll get a news|sd
B|hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature,|^q
B|or guess who our local sheriff,|^q
A|Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|I agree with that.|aa
A|Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,|sd
B|You were?|bh
A|and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|From what I understand, they act up pretty bad|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|What, uh,  grade is your daughter in?|qw
A|My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.|sd
B|Oh, no,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|They always had a paddle in our school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, they, they just don't do that any more.|sv
B|I know.|aa
A|But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid|sv
A|and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?|qy
A|Yes|ny
A|supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,|sd
A|and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.|qw^d
A|I guess we shouldn't get into that|ad
A|but, um, and what else, um,|^h
A|I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|No.|ar
B|Really?|bh
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|Ooh.|bk
A|I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Um.|b
A|Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.|sd
A|I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.|sv
B|Oh, I do too,|aa
B|I think they're doing real good job.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|so.|%
B|But, then, what do I know,|qh
B|I don't have any kids.|ng
B|No,|nn
B|none at all|sd
A|Yeah,|bk
A|okay,|bk
A|so this is probably a real hard subject for you.|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah|ny
A|Yeah.|bk
A|Okay,|bk
A|well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|It was a joy in talking with you.|fc
B|Well, it was good talking to you too.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|thanks.|fc
B|We'll see you,|fc
B|bye-bye.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
A|Well, what do you know about Latin American policies?|qo
B|Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent, really.|sv
B|Uh, I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.|sv
B|That, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much without, you know, just telling them, running their country for them|na
A|Right.|b
B|but,|%
A|That, that's just it.|ba
B|It's got to be tough,|sv
B|but, I mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|I guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term,|sv
A|and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,|aa
A|but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine from Columbia,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and uh, you know, of course I, I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|but but that is, that's a tough deal,|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|and it,|%
B|I don't think that,|%
B|maybe I, maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it,|sv
B|but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries|sv
B|and I mean, they've been hammering , for the last, you know, ten centuries,|sv
A|Sure.|aa
B|and it's still going on,|sv
B|and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how, some times,|sv
A|Yep,|aa
A|that's about the lump sum of it.|aa
A|Well, um, I was speaking with a, a woman|sd
A|from, I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there,|sd
A|no,|ar
A|she was from El Salvador|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family,|sd
A|and when, uh, the Contras came into power, of course with,|sd
A|uh, oh, gosh darn, what's his face,|t1
A|he's in, in Florida jail now,|sd
A|Marcos|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
A|uh, no,|ar
A|he's, Marcos is Philippines,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|um, well, I'm blank on it.|sd
A|Well, you know who I'm talking about.|qy^d
B|I can see his face forget his name|na
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I know it, uh,|sd
A|anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|kind of nationalized it for himself,|sv
A|Right|b
A|right,|aa
A|and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect,|sd
A|and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance uh, because they were a democracy turned, uh|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Dictator,|^2
A|yeah,|aa
A|right|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|basically a dictator fascist.|sv
B|And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,|sv
B|it just you know, unstable.|sv
A|Sure.|aa
A|Well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico?|qo
B|Well, I think it's long overdue|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I just, you know,|%
B|there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, I'm not, you know, I have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,|sv
B|there's, uh, it seems like there's,|%
B|and I,|%
B|this may be unfair to Mexico,|sv
B|but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|Mexico,|%
A|they're, I know they're trying, they're really trying, the Mexican government is trying,|sv
A|and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves Americanized, I guess and, uh, which is great because that's what they basically need to do.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know,|sv
B|Yeah|b
A|and we don't have the Siesta,|sd
B|yeah.|b
A|and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of life,|sv
A|and we've had our way of life,|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|I think their, their version of the good old boy network going that,|sv
B|uh, you know, has a lot,|%
A|Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on?|qo
B|I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East.|sv
A|I have to agree with you there.|aa
A|I, uh, I think that, uh, for once, we should, we shouldn't even be at, at these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, we really don't have too much of a, uh, real we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is.|sv
A|Just let these people fight it out|sv
B|I agree.|aa
A|you know, we've got so many domestic problems,|sv
A|and, and what does it cost these people over there, you know.|qh
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|Oh, so how about the Soviet Union.|qo
A|What do you think's going to happen there.|qo
A|The break ups?|qo
B|I think that's great.|sv
B|Um, I'm glad to see that,|sd
B|but I, again, I don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, uh, well, uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because I, I don't know,|sd
B|I'm, I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,|sv
B|and so, I'm, I'm not much in favor of it,|sd
B|but I'm glad to see us advising them|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|that's right.|aa
B|But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,|sd
B|even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody who, who is working on that problem.|sv
B|And I, I haven't seen that in the last eleven years,|sv
B|so they don't seem to have a clue.|sv
A|Well, all I've seen.|%
A|Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of, of, of his political affairs.|sv
A|I, I think Bush's kind of followed suit.|sv
A|Um, international is important,|sv
A|but, uh, we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.|sv
A|Uh, you know, and then there's the homeless issue,|sv
A|and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, uh, hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think,|sv
A|and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending.|sv
B|Oh, I agree.|aa
B|I just, I think we got, once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the, the world bank, and as far as aid is concerned,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and I think there's a limit,|sv
B|and we passed it a long time ago.|sv
A|I agree.|aa
A|We've been writing off way too many bad debts|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's another thing I don't understand is, is, is things like selling technology and, uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt|sd
B|to me that just doesn't make any sense,|sv
B|as, as much in debt as we are|sv
A|I know it.|aa
B|I just, I don't know.|h
B|I think it's definitely time for a change,|sv
B|but I don't see anybody,|%
B|I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and Republicans,|sd
B|and it's either one way or the other,|sv
B|this it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|you either do it this way|sv
B|or you do it that way,|sv
B|and there's no in between|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|you're either liberal or you're conservative,|sv
B|and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.|sv
A|Well, I think, uh, it wouldn't hurt,|sv
A|and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a, a, a real force in, in the, uh, in Congress,|sd
A|but, uh, you're right,|aa
A|there's just too many issues that come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, uh, we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.|sv
B|Oh, I agree with you.|aa
B|Well, of course, you know, we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms,|sv
B|and, uh, as soon as, as we can get,|%
B|of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him|sv
B|so, it's not too, it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions.|sv
B|He's, uh, usually on the ninety-eight to two side,|sv
B|he's the one of the two that votes,|sv
A|He's one of the two, huh.|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|he's, very ineffective, I think.|sv
A|Well, let's see,|^h
A|Senators are in for six years, right|qy
B|Right.|na
A|and, uh, when did you guys vote him into office?|qw
B|Oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety.|sd
A|Oh, you're stuck.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we're stuck with him for a little while longer,|aa
B|but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,|sd

B|uh, in fact, I didn't even fertilize it this year,|sd
B|I just mowed it,|sd
B|and I, I mow it, uh, you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down|sd
A|Comes back in the yard|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|so you don't have any one do your yard.|qy^d
A|You do it yourself?|qy
B|I do it myself.|na
A|Yeah,|b
A|we do too.|sd
B|Have a lot of people trying to do it for me|sd
A|Isn't that the truth.|ba
A|A flyer's on every door every day.|sv
B|Hey, I need the exercise,|sd
B|so what the heck.|qh
A|That's right.|aa
A|Well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,|sd
A|he does the yard,|sd
A|and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,|sd
A|but I keep putting off learning.|sd
B|Hey, you've got the right idea.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|But I had recently gone out and planted mums.|sd
A|We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,|sd
A|and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and put out yellow and bronze|sd
A|and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,|sd
A|and she says Well, those are going to die just the first frost.|sd
A|She said, You should have done pansies.|sd
A|And I went, Well, now you tell me.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|So the first night, that around Halloween|sd
A|and we went out and covered them with a sheet,|sd
A|and they did okay that first night.|sd
A|But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,|sd
A|so I guess I've lost them.|sd
A|I haven't gone out to check yet.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't blame you.|ba
B|I wouldn't want to look at them.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|listen,|ad
A|but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here.|sd
A|I guess it was about four years ago.|sd
A|And we did not know in August to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up.|sd
A|Have you ever seen it what grub worms do?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
A|And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,|sd
A|it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.|sd
A|So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.|sd
A|It took a lot of money and a lot of time,|sd
A|so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you, you think that's what it was, huh.|qy
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|we found them|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|yeah|b
A|we found them.|sd
A|We dug under there about an inch|sd
A|and you could see them.|sd
A|They're real fat little white things,|sd
A|and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|those kind of brown, uh, What we call June bugs|sd
A|yeah,|aa
A|but in, but in the,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and some people call them May beetles.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|June bugs is what I'd heard them called,|sd
A|so any how, occasionally I find them in the flower beds.|sd
A|They said that every yard has some|sd
B|Uh, yeah.|b
A|but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.|sd
A|So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I had some of that problem,|sd
B|but mine was freeze.|sd
A|Oh, yeah|aa
A|that too,|aa
A|two years ago, or last Christmas is that what you're talking about?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I'm still I'm still replacing that in the back, especially, under the trees uh, you know, kind of slow, and, as you say, very expensive.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I caught Wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,|sd
B|and, uh I bought about twenty of them.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I guess you did too.|sd
A|It's what they've done in the spring or the fall.|sd
B|Uh, well, I put, you know|%
B|that was late,|sv
B|that was like,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that was like September, I think.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I had to water it, you know|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|gosh.|ba
A|keep it damp.|b
A|Well, my,|%
A|out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in Plano,|sd
A|at least the area where,|sd
A|we're over by Collin Creek Mall,|sd
A|and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,|sd
A|and all those variegated, uh, things died.|sd
A|So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly,|sd
A|and they just live,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they're pretty tough, uh,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you can, you can stand those.|sv
B|Pittosporum is kind of borderline here|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and usually it'll do pretty well,|sd
B|but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it zaps it.|sd
A|Well it's kind of like one of these,|%
B|Oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way.|sv
A|Same way,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|That, they, they warned me of that one finally.|sd
A|And I said, You know, you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,|sd
A|and we didn't know the difference.|sd
A|And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these mums.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Okay,|b
A|next year, I'll do pansies.|sd
B|Your list is growing,|sv
A|And my backyard, we had it really nice,|sd
A|and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy,|sd
A|and so, it was about,|%
A|I guess he's three now,|sd
A|so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|oh, gee.|ba
B|Um.|b
A|So, it's like our backyard is just kind of like,|%
A|as long as he won't damage it, fine,|sd
A|and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,|sv
B|yeah.|%
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Very much,|aa
A|but, uh.|%
B|I had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh,|sd
A|You did.|b
B|It did pretty well,|sd
B|it's, it's like on the side, the apron of the, of the parkway out behind the garage|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley|sd
A|So do ours,|sd
A|yeah.|%
B|and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there|sd
A|What did you grow?|qw
B|Well, I had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,|sd
B|and I had, I had okra,|sd
A|That is amazing.|ba
B|and by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|they kind of came out looking like gourds.|sd
A|Well, put them in a salad, though,|ad
A|and you say, well, I made it though, at least it's mine.|ad
B|But I had squash,|sd
B|I had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,|sd
A|They tell you what our topic was?|qy
B|I think golf, isn't it?|qy
A|Right.|na
A|How much of a golfer are you?|qw
B|Are you a hacker?|qy
A|You bet.|na
A|I'm fifty years old,|sd
A|I've been a hacker,|sd
A|I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than I play right now.|sd
B|I know I, Oh, I know I did,|sd
B|I know I did.|sd
A|And, uh,|%
B|Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know,|sd
B|and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body.|sv
A|Oh, I know,|aa
A|it's just unreal.|sv
A|I, you know, I'm a guy that plays,|sd
A|if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year|sd
A|and that's about it.|sd
A|I figure that's my retirement game.|sd
A|I really,|%
A|I come from a family of golfers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.|sd
B|Sure.|b
A|And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap,|sd
A|but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every,|sd
A|they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That was their deal,|sd
A|they,|%
B|That's what it takes,|ba
B|you, you need to play that often to get a really good handicap .|sv
A|But, uh I just, I just never could do it.|sd
A|I have a brother-in-law who is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro|sd
A|and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf|sd
A|sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.|sd
B|Well, I went to,|sd
B|I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more|sd
B|and I, I went after it|sd
B|and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.|sd
B|Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would *listen go, go back up,|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|yeah,|ny
B|I, I think I need to, uh,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Spend more time on the,|sv
A|I think I'm probably the same way.|sv
A|Lessons do help.|sv
A|I know ever year we buy,|sd
A|I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner,|sd
A|it's a hunter's type affair|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I buy in, in Austin, Texas,|sd
A|I go down to Austin,|sd
A|I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country. You know, at, uh, Horseshoe Bay.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|I'm familiar with it.|sd
A|And we just have a ball,|sd
A|and we play three days in a row, three different courses|sd
A|and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.|sd
A|So,|%
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.|sd
A|You bet,|aa
A|so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly|sd
B|and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better,|sd
B|I, I, I get through the ball better.|sd
B|Uh, and I also, if I,|%
B|I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.|sd
A|You bet.|aa
B|And I,|%
B|my control is a little bit better there.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Uh, so,|%
A|That's super.|ba
A|I haven't learned to hit the ball easy|sd
A|and I just sort of,|sd
A|I'm always wanting to hit it hard|sd
A|and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball,|sd
A|and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone,|sd
A|when I do swing it's an easier swing|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I do, actually, hit the ball better.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I have a two through, you know, two through wedge.|sd
A|I hit a two iron awful lot.|sd
A|Off, now, off the tee.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't hit a driver off the tee.|sd
A|That, that's why I need my driving lessons.|sd
B|Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too,|sd
B|and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.|sd
A|That helps.|ba
B|Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh,|sd
B|I sacrificed distance,|sd
B|but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.|sd
A|Well, that's, that's a good idea.|sv
A|I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more|sd
A|and I'm going to do the same thing.|sd
A|I, I laid off my woods about three years ago|sd
A|and I just use a two wood off the fairway|sd
A|and I'm a fairly strong person|sd
A|so I get a pretty good little drive|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know,|sd
A|if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|absolutely.|aa
A|And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son|sd
A|so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more.|sv
B|If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice uh, range.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, I think there is less frustration factor there, too, uh,|sv
A|Makes good, makes good sense.|ba
B|So, but I, I,|%
B|the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start.|sd
B|Apparently they're very difficult to play with,|sv
B|but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.|sd
B|And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron,|sd
B|it's incredible.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it.|sd
B|And I,|%
B|and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with.|sd
B|He has used a lot,|sd
B|and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron. Uh, distance iron.|sv
A|You bet.|ba
A|My my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be great after that|sd
A|That, boy,|%
A|I just,|%
A|if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know|sd
B|And get away without embarrassing yourself,|bf
B|right|aa
A|Because,|%
B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, do you exercise regularly?|qy
B|There is,|%
B|well, I am a school teacher.|no
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, us,|%
B|there is, uh, uh, girl that went through our school district, I teach in Highland Park who, uh, does aerobics at the Y C A and I say Y, the Y W C A|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|to someone else in the turn that off please,|t3
B|I am recording. talking to speaker|t3
B|My husband just turned on something noisy.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Any way, uh, she comes to the school|sd
B|and there are a group of teachers,|sd
B|and we exercise regularly and, uh, for an hour|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we do it twice a week.|sd
A|Oh. That is good.|ba
B|And, uh, we do, uh, aerobics, for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes|sd
B|and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh.|b
B|So it is an hour.|sd
B|And then my husband and I take, uh, ten mile walks, uh, as often as possible.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, not on the nights that I do aerobics,|sd
B|but if, if he wants to, he jogs,|sd
B|but I, uh, I, we take the fast walks|sd
B|and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, we, we, take it seriously.|sd
B|We enjoy doing it.|sd
B|I  enjoy my group at school.|sd
B|It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself.|sd
A|Yeah.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, well I use to exercise regularly|sd
A|and I haven't lately|sd
B|Oh, oh|b
A|I have goofed off, I guess.|sd
A|Uh, I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, I guess my job change, my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more.|sd
B|Oh I understand that.|ba
A|So, uh,|%
B|I have never been able to do it before.|sd
A|Well, the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day,|sd
A|I just want to go home and not do anything.|sd
B|Well, I and too. I just make myself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I get up at five thirty|sd
B|and I am at school at seven thirty.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|School is not over until, uh, four|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and our class,|sd
B|but it is in the building|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|that is the big difference|sd
B|because there are other people around that, uh,|sd
B|you had better hurry.|t3
B|Go get dressed.|t3
B|You know, there is motivation around there|sd
B|and then, uh, we, we can change right there in the building.|sd
B|I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I just go|sd
B|and we, uh, exercise.|sd
B|And until then, you know I have belonged to exercise clubs|sd
B|and oh I have gone to, uh, oh, like, uh, oh, these gyms, you know that the, like in Plano and Richardson and, uh, where they offer the, uh, rec centers really where they offer aerobics|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I have done that before, but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you are just kind of going Ugh.|sv
B|And I have tried it immediately after school|sd
B|like, try to get some place and exercise from five to six,|sd
B|but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late.|sv
A|That is right.|aa
A|That is right.|aa
A|That is a .|sv
B|It is.|aa
B|It is really hard with our life style when you work to,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I know, some people go during lunch,|sd
A|but, you know by the time I get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work, it is probably two hours or more|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that is just too long.|sv
B|I have twenty-five minutes for lunch.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|That is out for me.|sd
A|That doesn't really do it, does it?|qh
B|No,|aa
B|I don't think so.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh,|sd
B|if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.|sd
B|You know, cause they know we are in the building and coming. Where as, at, uh, another place, you are paying a lot more money|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, it does going to start whether you are there or not|sv
A|That is right|aa
A|That is right.|aa
B|So this has worked out real nicely.|sd
B|In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.|sd
A|Well, that is not much.|ba
B|Huh-uh.|aa
B|So it's, it's,|%
B|we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in, uh, uh, school uh, report card period|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|That is not bad.|ba
B|Huh-uh.|aa
A|It beats memberships at some of these clubs.|ba
A|That is  for sure.|ba
B|You are  not kidding.|ba
A|They are real expensive.|sv
B|I know.|aa
B|We belonged, uh, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and at first we used it|sd
B|and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they offered lots of things,|sd
B|but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So we decided to forget that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That was just a waste of our our money.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well we have one through work|sd
B|Oh no.|ba
A|But, I, uh, I don't know|sd
A|I still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or I don't know something,|sd
A|but I need to do something.|sd
A|If, if its only walk the dog or something.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I need to start doing that.|sd
B|It does make you feel better.|sv
B|The hard thing is getting going.|sv
A|That is right.|aa
B|And if you have somebody who will do it with you,|sv
B|like, for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, uh, jog|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know,|sd
A|What are you guys having for Christmas?|qo
B|What are we having?|^h
B|Let's see|^h
B|Well, I'm not planning the menu.|sd
A|Oh, you're not.|bh
B|No|nn
B|We usually go out to either one of our folks,|sd
B|they both live close to|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, um, I don't know,|sd
B|it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham.|sv
A|Well, funny you should mention that.|sd
A|I'm a pig farmer|sd
B|Oh, you are|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|huh.|b
A|Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else,|sd
A|but we're going to have, uh, wild boar|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|we, uh, we killed a boar the other day,|sd
A|it was, you know, mating with the sows,|sd
A|and you can't use the piglets, you know,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Huh.|b
A|It's about six months of no use,|sd
A|so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham,|sd
A|and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him|sd
B|Is that, is that hard?|qy
A|Well, no,|nn
A|hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,|sd
A|I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|you just, uh,|%
A|you kill him, you know,|sd
A|you probably,|%
A|most guys just shoot them in the head,|sd
A|they go, you know,|sd
A|in a second they're gone|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use *more than one utt??  and then  start a charcoal fire on top of him.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,|sd
A|and it's the best eating you ever had.|sd
B|Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?|qy
A|Yep,|ny
A|just like a pig|sd
B|Does it.|bh
A|I mean,  you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds|sd
B|Oh my.|ba

A|Brisket?|bh
A|It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.|sd

B|Oh.|b
A|and, uh, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|I mean, no,|ar
A|I was kidding.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage,|sd
A|and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of, gristle where it attaches to the ribs,|sd
A|so it's really, really a tough piece of meat|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|So you just take it|sd
A|and you marinate it for a couple of days|sd
B|And that softens it up, huh.|bf
B|Huh.|b
A|And then, uh, you just put it in the oven,|sd
A|takes about four hours to cook one.|sd
A|They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.|sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|And, uh, we're going to have that.|sd
B|Well, what else do you serve with your pig?|qw
A|Oh, well, we'll have cranberries and hominy|sd

A|fresh tomatoes.|sd
B|Oh, we, we just got lots of snow|sd

A|there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down.|sd
A|I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny

A|Well, it's desert, you know,|sd
A|where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, uh, the edge of the desert,|sd
A|I mean, it's part of the Great Plains.|sd
A|So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten|sd
B|Oh, gee.|ba
A|and at night it goes down to about sixty.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours.|sd
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|So everything that lives around here is real tough|sd
B|Oh|b
A|That's trees, you know,|sd
A|we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.|sd

A|That's all the bigger they get,|sd
A|they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.|sd
B|What, what,|%
B|how do you get your main source of current events?|qw
A|Well, uh, until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL,|sd
A|and I thought that was a good way,|sd
A|but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things.|sd
A|You know, it's a week or two late,|sd
A|but, uh, that's how I'm staying up.|sd
B|I either watch the news|sd
B|or, or occasionally I'll read the paper.|sd
A|Uh, do you like how it's presented on the news?|qy
B|Um, no,|nn
B|I think the media's a little bit too manipulative.|sv
B|They allow you, uh,|sv
B|they, they try to lead you too much, I believe,|sv
B|and sometimes they're not very open,|sv
B|I, I don't know,|sd
B|I think they're a little bit biased sometimes.|sv
B|Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case.|sd
B|The coverage on that was, you know,|sv
B|when it first happened it was, he was guilty, he was guilty, he was guilty.|sd
B|You know, they try to have you form opinions or whatever,|sv
B|and then I, I didn't like the the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that.|sd
B|You know, basically I, I, I think they don't present the, the whole sides of, of everything.|sv
A|So, it, it makes you feel like they're, uh, wanting you to take their opinion.|bf
B|Right.|aa
B|It's, it's, it's, instead of reporting the news, it's more like an editorial, I believe on a lot of issues.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I've noticed that too,|sd
A|and it's kind of distressing, isn't it?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|And they just, I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words, uh, usually, uh, just that sway the whole, uh, report that, you know, by just a couple of words.|sv
B|Well, when, when I was in school, I, um, I was a communications major,|sd
B|so I, I, I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking, and, and so forth|sd
A|So, communications, huh.|bf
A|Were you looking into becoming a reporter|qy
A|or,|%
B|I was,|na
B|and, um, I I ventured off in a whole entire different field, field.|sd
B|I went with the state.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I, um, went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability,|sd
B|calculate benefits.|sd
A|I bet that's a interesting job.|ba
B|Yeah.|aa
B|So the,|%
B|so, and, you know, working, you know, working for state government you hear all about current events, about things going on within the state itself.|sd
B|So that, that's another source that I, I, where I keep up with current events|sd
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|there's one that I'm reading right now.|sd
A|It's INFORMATION WEEK.|sd
A|It says A T and T to account for the, the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability.|sd
A|It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three, to account for that.|sd
B|It's a lot of money.|ba
A|And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.|sd
B|It's a lot of money.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|sd
A|And, yeah, you have to stay up on stuff,|sv
A|and I bet in your, your job that you have to,|sd
A|do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|well, no,|nn
B|I, I, I primarily deal with the state employees,|sd
B|but I, I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the, like the state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.|sd
B|And I really know what the budget is,|sd
B|and, and, uh, uh, when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes, and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that,|sd
B|and, you know, I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has,|sd
B|and it, it's just funny.|sv
B|You know, so that's, that's, that's,|%
B|so I don't have a whole lot of faith in, in, you know, the news.|sd
B|Course it's,|%
B|they, they get what they hear from,|sv
B|but, you know, it's not always I, I think one hundred percent reliable.|sv
A|Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective?|qo
B|I think they need to do a little bit, go into a little bit more depth, uh, before they would just report, like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that,|sv
B|because I mean, another example is the, uh, AIDS issue or whatever.|sd
B|You know, someone said, Oh, I found a cure.|sd
B|They immediately,|%
B|the headlines on the news or whatever is, Someone says they found a cure for AIDS.|sd
B|And then two months later it's discovered it's not, you know,|sd
B|before they, before they come out with something like that they need to, to research the matter, I believe, a little bit more.|sd
A|I guess they do that so they don't get scooped, you know,|sv
A|so they have the big story.|sv
B|Well, that,|%
B|well, yeah|aa
B|I, I,|%
B|it,|%
B|I think the,|%
B|Let's see, *something missing? A.1?|^h
B|my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,|sd
B|but, I, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas,|sd
B|but basically he does all the heavy stuff,|sd
B|and I do all the fun stuff|sd
A|Well, we have it just opposite here.|sd
A|My wife works in, you know, at, at, at the T I,|sd
A|and she's, uh, sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I see.|b
A|And we have about ten acres,|sd
A|and she tries to mow about half of it|sd
B|Wow.|ba
B|Wow. That's a, a big job.|ba
A|Well, yeah,|aa
A|it keeps, uh, well,|%
A|it's doing real well,|sd
A|because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and now, you know, since we've been mowing it,|sd
A|and, you know, of course we water a little bit,|sd
A|that's just too much to water all at once,|sd
A|but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.|sd
B|Oh, sure.|ba
B|Oh, I bet it's beautiful.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers.|sd
A|We have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The rest of it is just like wild flowers|sd
B|Wild flowers.|b^m
A|and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're about, oh, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds lovely.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, the wild flowers are beautiful.|sv
B|I think, um, I was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets|sd
B|or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.|sd
B|Then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, she enjoys mowing.|sd
A|I can't believe it.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I know a lot of|sd
A|I mean, I hate it|sd
B|uh-huh,|b
B|a lot of women do. Um,|sd
B|I've just never really, you know,|sd
B|maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow,|sd
B|but, um, my husband takes it on,|sd
B|and I'll help rake up the grass,|sd
B|and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um,|sd
B|because, we don't have that much property,|sd
B|but we're on a corner lot,|sd
B|so there's a lot of edging to do|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country,|sv
B|you don't have to worry about any of that|sv
A|We don't even have any concrete or asphalt.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh, that's nice,|ba
B|I,|%
B|this is different for us because the other,|sd
B|in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,|sd
B|and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees,|sd
B|and we do miss that.|sd
B|Um, if we had a chance to move, I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as, as far as that goes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|but, you know, we do everything together.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the,|sd

B|Wow that's,|ba
A|and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and I, uh, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|So.|%
B|Right.|b
B|Well, I put,|%

A|And we got a few, you know,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.|sd

A|Oh.|bk
B|But as, as|%
B|I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either.|sd

A|and I spend a lot of time|sd
A|and I probably get more exercise than your average person.|sv
A|But, it's not a, a structured sort of thing,|sd
A|and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well I, I've,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
B|and,  and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.|sd

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, it makes it less of a chore?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And, it's got,|%
B|and I've always enjoyed dance.|sd

B|I, I can't get out to dance all the time|sd
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|would that we could|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and it's, and it's more regulated,|sd
B|I mean you're, you're using different parts of the body.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|So, it, it is like dance,|sv
B|and it's structured like that,|sv
B|but you have the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting, so, it makes it easier for me.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's move that way, instead of me having to think about it so much.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|aa
A|You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise|sv

B|yeah.|aa
B|But, I'm like you,|sv
B|I also, um, like to participate in, uh, things like,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from, all over the country.|sd
B|You wouldn't know that|sd
B|Oh, I,|%
A|So, it's the, it's, it's the, the well it's actually,|%
A|it's interesting, because there are real regional differences.|sv
A|Um, in California there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that,|sd
A|I'm, I'm, I'm not. Uh,|sd
A|there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban California.|sd
A|And, maybe not,|aap_am
A|I don't know about rural California too well.|sd
A|But, in urban California it's just, you know,|sd
A|for all I know aerobics started out here.|sd
A|I don't know where they actually started,|sd
A|but they, you know, the craze really picked up big here|sd
A|and before that there was the running craze.|sd
A|And, they,|%
A|California gets, you know, tends to be a bit faddish,|sv
A|but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, there must be something to some of them.|sv
A|And, uh,|%
B|Well, I think people are, are more um, um,|sv
B|people from California seem to be more health motivated all around. I mean, as far as the diet, and everything. Uh, the diet and, uh, just your health consciousness,|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|And, I,|%
B|it's curious, I don't know why, don't know if it's,|sv
B|do you,|qy

A|Well, there's a sense of it being a package,|sd
A|I think. There, there is a sense of, you know, whole,|%
A|there's a lot of, you know,|%
A|you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.|sd
A|It, it's on fairly solid scientific ground.|sd
A|Uh, it's just dispensed with these distinctions.|sd
A|It says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so that they, they combined them all together.|sd
A|And, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time.|sd
A|Um, there's been some progressive medical schools out here, that have taken that approach.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|And, um,|%
B|Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program.|qy
A|Boy,|^h
B|Do you  think the program came  first or the,|qy
A|yeah,|ny
A|that,|%
A|there's a,|%
A|I, I can say there's a correlation, but I couldn't say which, which caused the other.|sv
A|They sort of, you know, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the more money they put into it.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|And,|%
B|I can see that.|bk
B|And, cause, I,|%
B|knowing|%
B|from institutes of learning like that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere,|sd
B|and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,|sd
B|so,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
A|And, part of it is California, you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements|sv
A|and some of them fizzled out|sd
A|and some of them were disastrous|sd
A|and others of them, um, had an impact on the society around here.|sd
A|And one of the ones that had an impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices,|sv
A|I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved medicine.|sv
A|Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things out here.|sd
A|And, and you could have them around long enough|sv
A|and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.|sd
A|The irony is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise.|sv
A|And, I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks.|sv
A|The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally,  the laborers,|sv

A|last thing,|%

B|we always had horses around,|sd
B|and I really enjoyed that,|sd
A|Oh, that's great,|ba
A|sounds like you,|sv
B|and I was disappointed when I went to Texas.|sd
B|I didn't see that many of them.|sd
A|Horses?|br
B|Yes|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you really don't.|sv
A|Yeah,|%
A|the,|%
A|you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh,|sv
B|I know,|aa
B|I know,|aa
B|it's true.|aa
A|there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people|sv
A|and that's about it down here,|sv
A|and so,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, that's great.|ba
A|Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|you too,|sv
B|you too.|sv
A|Well, great,|ba
A|well look, uh,|^h
A|I know it's probably late for you,|sv
B|Okay.|b
A|I enjoyed speaking with you|fc
B|Me too.|fc
A|have a good weekend.|fc
B|Okay.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye, now.|fc
A|Well, the thing is, is that I, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|since I'm in school I don't, like, basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad,|sd
A|but the thing is, is that, um, I have to keep it under control because, for example, you know, it's like the, the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything, everything is pretty rough,|sd
A|but he controls that part|sd
A|but, then whenever, you know,|%
A|it's like, once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is.|sd
A|And the only thing that I, I basically spend my money on is just food|sd
A|and, um, so,|%
B|What about tuition and rent?|qw
B|Who takes care of that?|qw
A|Well, the thing is, is that I live in a dorm.|sd
B|Uh.|b
A|So, uh, what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And then the tuition is also the same thing.|sd
A|So, the thing is, is basically that I spend, like, maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks on, on groceries|sd
A|and that's about it.|sd
A|But the thing, uh, also is that, you know, like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, um, you know, three times a week.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|you can't do that very often.|sv
A|So, I mean, it's,|%
A|for, for us, you know, it's like, I, I can spend, I can spend that money|sd
A|but it's not, it's not what I want to spend it on, you know.|sd
B|Are, are you working anywhere while you are going to school?|qy
A|No.|nn
B|Okay.|bk
A|Because, um, they don't allow me to work since, uh, I'm a foreign student.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|And so they, the government doesn't allow me to work.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so all the money comes from home.|bf
A|Uh-huh.|aa
B|So, you got to make, uh,|bf
B|so how do you keep track of where you are in, in your monthly spending?|qw
A|Well, the thing is, is that, um, I I basically know how much I have, right?|qy
B|Right.|na
A|And so, the thing is, is that I, I can tell like, uh,|%
A|I, I get all my money out of the teller.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call, you know, international.|sd
B|Where do you call to?|qw
A|Argentina.|sd
B|Argentina?|br
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Wow.|ba
A|And so the|%
A|one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|talk too long.|bf
A|Well, that's,|%
A|they, they want me to call down there every so often.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, I told my dad, Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often, you know,|sd
A|he goes, we want to keep in touch|sd
A|so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you.|^q
B|Yeah,|b
B|so you call him collect?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|Because it is more expensive that way.|sd
B|What makes you , think so?|qo
A|Any, any, um,|%
A|basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, um, because it's considered a luxury in other countries.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|So, you just call him direct|bf
B|and then,|%
A|Right.|aa
A|Since it's his money anyway, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And he gets the, and you get the bill and send it to him?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|Um, I got money to pay that, too.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|So, it's basically, you know,|%
A|it's like, it's not too much money,|sd
A|and it's not too little money,|sd
A|so I won't have to, you know, rush a letter to him or something,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because, um, he really wants me to concentrate on my studies.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|What are you, what are you studying?|qw
A|I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering.|sd
B|And what do you think you'll do with that?|qo
A|With those degrees?|bf
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Well, I can, I can work up, um, here up to a year.|sd
B|And?|qo
A|And hopefully get a job after that.|sd
B|You want to get into some kind of manufacturing,|qy
B|or what's the specialty that your looking for?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Um, computer communications and data transmissions.|sd
B|Oh, okay,|bk
B|so you want to find a, uh, data transmissions,|qy^d
B|you're looking for, uh, um, long distance type stuff.|qy^d
A|Right.|na
A|Yeah,|ny
A|you know, anywhere from, um, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, you know, all that,|sd
A|and so, well, you have a family, right?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I have a wife and two children|sd
B|and, um,|%
A|And does, does your wife work?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|She doesn't work,|sd
B|she does, uh,|sd
B|well, it's kind of hard to say now days, um, other than taking care of the house, she does a lot of sewing herself.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|And she gets paid for that|sd
B|so she brings some money in.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|She is trying to start her own business where she does that full time. Alterations and sewing. Stuff for the public|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.|sd
A|And so, and you have a monthly budget?|qy
B|Well, sort of.|no
B|We're probably like most American families, I guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and we know what bills have to be paid,|sd
B|and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with, with the monthly budget,|sd
B|so.|%
A|So, you don't have any problem in, um, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.|qy^d
B|Oh sure.|na
B|We're like everybody else, you know,|sv
B|we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|You know, that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff.|sv
A|Well then, uh, see, uh, that's, that's one of the points which I don't see,|sd
A|like I, I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas|sd
A|and I, you know, I don't I don't like to give any at all|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because the thing is, is that, you know, it's like if I want something I'll, I'll ask somebody, you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|like, like, uh, for uh, for Christmas my roommate goes, what do you want.|sd
A|And I said, I want a backpack.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You no,|%
A|I told him if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's something that you can use.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|because I, I needed a backpack.|sd
A|So, he gave me a backpack,|sd
A|and I, I knew he needed an alarm clock.|sd
B|Yeah. Utilitarian.|b
A|So, I bought him an alarm clock.|sd
A|So, the thing was that, that,|%
A|Right,|aa
A|but|%
B|Necessary things , no frivolous gifts.|bf
A|right,|aa
A|but, um, the thing is, especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was, to me it was ridiculous,|sv
A|because you know, you have to,|sv
A|once a year you go out|sv
A|and you spend all this money on all these people,|sv
A|and some you don't care about, you know,|sv
A|it's like,|sv
B|That's true,|aa
B|why bother.|bf
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so, but the thing is, is, that, um.|%
B|Well, especially being a college student your,|sv
B|I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving, you know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|that effects the budget especially around, uh, Christmas time|sv
B|at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|aa
B|What about when you have breaks like, um, Christmas or between sessions?|qw
A|Well, for example, we had spring break now,|sd
A|and I went skiing|sd
A|and I spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.|sd
B|I expect so.|ba
A|So, uh, but you know, its like, um.|%
B|You've got to budget that though.|sv
B|You've got to save up in able to do that, right?|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|I mean,|%
A|Because it's like, you know, say, you know, it's like, we were saying, let's go eat out before spring break.|sd
A|I go, let's not go eat out, before spring break.|sd
A|Let's see how much money we have afterwards.|^q
B|Right, .|b
A|And if I felt like I spent way to much then, um, I won't go out, you know,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and so, like my roommate went home,|sd
A|I went skiing in, over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything,|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|but, um, but it was, you know, it was, I guess it was worth it,|sv
B|Sure it is,|ba
B|any time you can get away, and, and, get away from, from the daily grind.|sv
A|You know, it was a nice place.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|especially if you live on campus, and you don't have a car, you just go crazy.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I know the feeling.|sd
A|So, oh well, let's see how long have we been talking here|qw
A|six minutes and a half.|sd
A|Okay.|fc
B|Is that okay?|fc
A|Yeah.|fc
B|All right.|fc
A|All right.|fc
A|Well, nice talking to you.|fc
B|Nice talking to you.|fc
B|Have a good time.|fc
A|All right.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
A|Well, do you think, uh,|%
A|I mean I wonder,|%
A|the assumption is that it is a problem, uh,|sv
A|and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem, though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem|sd
A|and, uh, but it's not clear to me that it is.|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|Um, it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically, or in terms of their opinions.|sv
A|But if those who don't vote, if you made them vote|sv
A|and, it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, you know, in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem, um.|sv
B|Um, that's, that's interesting,|ba
B|because I had thought,|%
B|I feel that it's a problem also,|sd
B|but, I see your point on that.|aa
A|I mean, I, I assume that those who don't vote,|%
A|I mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote, they tend to be, you know,|sv
A|poor blacks, for example, vote very little, and things like that|sv
A|and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter.|sv
A|But I don't know if that's the case.|^h
B|Uh.|b
A|In  fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't.|sd
B|Apparently they don't think it's a problem|sv
A|Uh, I guess not,|aap_am
A|I'm, I, I vote religiously,|sd
A|I really do.|sd
A|Um, I guess, I guess I'm a fan of democracy|sd
A|and, uh, wish I could vote on more things frankly.|sd
B|That's right, um,|aa
A|But it's funny because here in California things are getting, uh, increasingly democratically oriented, in, in the sense of people being able to vote for things.|sd
A|I mean, we have these initiatives, state initiatives now.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|The  first really popular, you know wide spread one was, uh, Proposition Thirteen which was a, uh, tax revolt,  against property taxes.|sd
B|Right,|bk
B|I|%
A|Uh, and, you know, now we're,|%
A|and that was whatever, ten years ago|sd
A|and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that.|sd
A|I mean, we've just,|%
A|there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals|sd
A|and you had to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them|sd
A|and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them|sd
A|and it was incredibly complicated and difficult.|sd
A|And a lot of people revolted against that,|sd
A|they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,|sd
A|you  know, that's, that's, that's why we hire people who, uh, you know, to, to make these decisions for us.|sv
B|I, I kind of feel the opposite, though.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things.|sd
A|I do|aa
B|I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us|sv
B|but they're not speaking for me.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I wouldn't mind having, oh, more votes than I get to have, frankly|sd
B|That's true.|aa
A|Anyone who  doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote.|sd
A|That  would make me happy though.|sd
A|Maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would.|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|it's interesting, uh, some countries voting is obligatory.|sd
A|Uh,  it is in Australia, for example.|sd
B|Is that true?|br
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|I didn't  know that,|sd
B|I was|%
B|that is one solution to it.|sv
A|I don't know how I feel about that.|sd
B|But I don't,|%
B|that's not really democratic. Not  what I'd consider truly democratic.|sv
A|Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States.|sd
B|As,|%
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And it's  not for me to say that they're not.|h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, they, they feel,|%
A|I mean here you have the right to vote|sd
A|and they simply define it as a duty there.|sd
A|You know, we have, just as we have a a duty to pay taxes, you know,|sd
A|is that democratic?|qh
A|I mean, we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country,|sd
A|we have the duty to pay taxes.|sd
B|It's a duty, right.|aa
A|And in that country  it's a duty to pay taxes|sd
A|and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent.|sd
A|And it's not clear to me that, that's so much less democratic.|sv
A|Um. I don't know,|h
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but part of me rebels against that,|sd
B|I, it's, that's,  it's complex question when you start thinking about it, isn't it|qy
A|but then I'm  an American.|sd
A|Yeah.|ny
A|And some people don't vote,|sd
A|I mean there is|%
A|like three or four percent of Australians don't vote|sd
A|and I think they're eligible for a fine.|sd
A|I don't know if they actually are fined or, or what happens,|h
A|but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's interesting.|ba
B|I have people here that I know that have never registered to vote.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I think, I think they feel they can criticize if they don't|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I was sort of,|%
B|I told them if they don't  vote they don't have the right to criticize.|sd
A|Well I,|%
A|that's how I feel.|sd
A|I mean, if if you vote and your guy looses well you you least tried|sv
A|and you can say something|sv
A|but if you don't vote, I sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, you know.|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|I feel|%
A|And certainly that's true in  the overall,|sv
A|I mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole,|sv
A|I sort of feel that way. When they especially when someone, they, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for, or something like that. *listen: two utts?|sv
A|And, you know, I say well, you know, voting for the lesser of two evils is still important.|sv
B|I think it is too.|aa
B|Sometimes it is a difficult choice.|sv
B|You don't feel as though you have much of a choice,|sv
B|but|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I mean, you, I mean, it's, it's funny because technically you do.|sv
A|I mean you have the right to do a write in candidate.|sd
A|But of course that's, that's not really a vote.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|It doesn't really gain anything.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|it really doesn't,|aa
A|and so it's, it's a complicated situation,|sv
A|but I would like to see,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|I, I, I'm, I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia|sd
A|and,  and perhaps  I'll call you back and let you know what, how the Australian system works.|sd
B|Is that|%
A|I  mean, not because of the I mean I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting,  but just  because of a job opportunity.|sd
B|Not|%
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|And, uh, I,|%
B|I'm are you a T I employee, I'm interested.|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I'm not.|sd
B|Not,|b^m
B|okay,|bk
B|I  just wondered.|h
A|And, uh, so I'm, I'm really quite, quite curious, how that would work, to have both, I mean, you know,|sd
A|and I believe in the, in a certain, uh,|%
A|Soviet bloc countries you are, are obliged to vote too.|sv
A|In fact, it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for, up until fairly recently|sv
A|and, that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote.|sd
A|But when you actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its two party system, um,|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|I kind of,|%
A|part of me is wary|sd
A|and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty, um.|sd
B|Well, uh, maybe they should,|sv
B|perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age.  Required to register  and vote for four years,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well that's a thought,|ba
A|or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have,|sv
A|I don't know.|h
A|The right to write your,|%
B|Maybe it should go with a driver's license|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's, see that's an example of a right, not a, not a,|sv
A|actually|arp_nd
A|that's considered a privilege, not a right.|sv
B|That is a privilege,|sv
B|right,|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|but technically people, most people,|%
A|technically it's a privilege,|sd
A|but most people think of it as a right.|sd
A|I mean, in other words if the government denies you driving, denies you a driver's license, people get very upset.|sd
A|But actually it's a privilege,  which is  allowed to be revoked.|sv
B|It is.|aa
B|That's correct.|aa
A|And, fortunately voting isn't that.|sv
B|Maybe it should, maybe it should be.|sv
A|Except, well except if you're a felon,|sd
A|if you're a felon it is taken away from you.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, they will take away your right to vote, under certain circumstances.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Um, so, gosh,|^h
A|so we don't have a great solution yet do we|sv
B|Don't have a great|b^m
B|I, I think I checked that as a question I'd be willing to discuss too|sd
B|Oh.|%
A|But I, I also, I also, I don't know if you've, uh, read any of the, um, oh, what do they call those. The, uh, the early republican, uh, republic documents, uh, when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|I haven't.|sd
A|Um, oh, I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party now,  versus  a democratic, uh, government and, arguing successfully, why, the United States should be a republic, not a democracy. Which indeed it really is, a republic, not a democracy.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues.|sd
A|In other words, you vote for representatives.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the whole idea was, um, presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,|sd
A|Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.|sd
A|And, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process,|sd
A|because anytime you have a majority, um, they can change the law in a a fully democratic process|sd
A|and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case. Um,|sd
A|oh, you know, a|%
A|if there's some minority that people don't like because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote vote against them.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And  cases like that, he argues, need to be constrained,|sd
A|and, and actually I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote|sd
B|Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, I, I mean, I feel that, I feel that|sd
B|I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well their job is to be reelected, by in large,|sv
A|and, so they work on that job.|sv
A|And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, you know, where government is misspending your dollars|sv
A|and, and they're all fools,|sv
A|and you know, throw, throw the bastards out,|sv
A|that kind of thing.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange,|sv
A|because, I mean, if I'm hiring a plumber, I want a real plumber,|sv
A|I want someone trained in,|%
A|Well, uh, what what do you think about the metric system?|qo
A|Uh, do you, uh, find it useable?|qy
A|Have you tried much with it?|qy
B|Well, with an engineering,  degree,  it's, of course, it's a whole lot easier.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because,  uh,|%
A|To use you mean,|bf
A|uh-huh.|b
B|yeah,|aa
B|if, if somebody  is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human nature being what it is we don't like to change.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|Uh, it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|We,|%
A|well I've lived both in the United States and, and in a country where they do use the metric system|sd
A|and, uh, so I've, I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.|sd
A|Um, the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and,  pounds  to uh, uh, kilograms,|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|and, I  think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|how  on earth am I every going to do the math? *spelling|^q
B|Right.|b
A|And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or whatever, and, you know, and leaving it at that|sv
A|and, uh, you know, a kilogram weighs about this much|sd
A|and get used to it from scratch,|sv
A|cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters|sd
A|but I'm perfectly comfortable using either.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I think the real problem with this, this weird conversion, you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, you know, whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour, you know,|sv
A|people, you know,|%
A|it's hard to take it seriously.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,|sd
A|you just say, well look read the miles per hour one,|sd
A|the other one must be for someone else.|^q
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, I don't know,|h
A|I mean even Britain has converted over|sd
A|and we inherited this mess from them|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|That's right,|aa
B|it's all their fault.|sv
A|Well, I mean, it's more  our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,|sv
A|I don't know why they um, were more able than we were|%
A|except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now|sv
A|and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to|sv
B|Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more,|%
B|is much more necessary for them than for us.|sv
A|That's true,|aa
A|that's, that's probably true|aa
A|and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.|sd
B|There's an expression for that,|sd
B|With eyes on the past, backing confidently into the future.|^q
A|I've never heard that one,|sd
A|that's very nice|ba
A|Oh, so I'm all for the metric system and converting over|sv
A|and I think,|%
A|I guess, my feeling is the way to do it is, is to just start giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert.|sv
A|Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound,|sd
A|this is a package of dates mind you,|sd
A|it's, was, presumably something you weigh fairly precisely,|sd
A|it said one pound|sd
A|and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda|sd
A|cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um,|sd
A|every time I see something like that I think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, uh, I, I don't think it'll, it could ever happen with, with a quick transition.|sv
A|You don't?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|I, I think that would be the easiest way|sv
B|but human nature being such as it is,  I would  think it would take, probably, two or three years before people could completely cut the cord.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh, oh, that's what I was thinking by quick transition,|sd
A|I didn't mean, you know, I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,|sd
A|at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.|^q
B|Did they switch?|qy
A|Uh, I believe so,|^h
A|yeah,|ny
A|and I think they did it overnight|sd
A|cause you know, you can't do it gradually.|sd
A|That's an example of something you can't do gradually.|sd
B|Well that's true.|aa
B|It, it has to be kind of a discreet transaction|bf
A|Yes,|aa
A|it does|aa
A|A quantum leap from left to right hand drive|sd
B|Interesting.|ba
A|And they,|%
A|but, you know, that must have taken, uh,|%
A|that was something that had to be done quickly,  you know,  because of external circumstances,|sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe,  or  the rest of continental Europe|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, you know. But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm sure.|ba
A|Um, so I, I, I, I, I think it's essential that it's done|sv
A|and I think the real trick is to avoid the you know,|sv
A|a little more attention to human psychology|sv
A|and, whereas, people want round numbers|sv
A|and after all, the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers,  so they  don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch|sd
B|Exactly,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|and so what the exact,|%
A|the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented.|sv
A|Really, I think.|sv
B|Well, we do have the two liter soda pop bottles.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|I saw that,|sd
A|I saw that the other day.|sd
A|I don't drink soda pop,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but  I saw a two liter soda pop bottle|sd
A|so, yeah,|%
A|things like that are a good start|sv
A|and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers,  you know,  two point two pounds or something. I think people will start getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|Yes.|aa
B|That's true.|ba
B|Well, sure have enjoyed our talk.|fc
A|Yes,|fc
A|well get back to what you're doing|fc

B|First question,|sd
B|do you own your house?|qy
A|Uh, right,|na
A|well, we try.|sd
A|I mean it's a big mortgage in the sky|sd
A|and someday, maybe, we might even own it,|sd
A|but, um, for all practical purposes, I guess we hold the mortgage|sd
B|Our name is on the till,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|so that implies ownership.|sd
A|No one else has offered to pay for it.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|I would not object if anybody did.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|really they could move right into the spare room|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.|sd
B|Before that we lived in Garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park.|sd
B|It's a, uh,|%
B|I don't know if you have been up here,|qy^d
B|but it is a residential homeowners, association.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
B|So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land.|sd
B|But, uh, we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market, you know,|sd
B|it could not possibly have gone any lower|sd
B|and so we were wrong|sd
A|Oh, five years ago.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
B|I think,|%
B|what,|%
B|it bottom out about a year later.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, well,|%
A|I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out.|sv
B|Oddly enough, two years, you know,|aa
B|I, uh, I think that,|%
A|But, maybe not in your area,|sv
A|see, it was just different areas,|sd
B|not in, in, uh, this area.|sd
B|Cause this is about like the,|%
A|That's a really nice area.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Besides, it's, you know, it's not, it's not Richardson. Is it?|qy
A|It's still considered Garland.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|it's, it's Richardson.|sd
A|Oh, ok,|bk
A|yeah.|b
B|It's, Richardson|sd
B|and, hold on a second.|ad
B|to someone in Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well,|t3
B|I don't want to hear you.|t3
B|You are being rude.|t3

A|It sounded good to me|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I hate to say how long that will last too.|sd
B|No,|^h
B|this area up here is, uh, all custom homes,|sd
B|and, it's,|%
A|Right.|b
B|I don't think that many by the builder that built this house.|sd
B|And, we were not the first people, the first owners,|sd
B|I think we are the third owners.|sd
A|Uh, okay.|b
B|It was built by the architect for himself, who never moved into it. Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|Oh, yeah,|ba
B|caulking windows was a great mystery to them.|sd
A|Oh, gee.|ba
B|So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet.|sd
B|But, it's a Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything,|sd
B|it did not really mean anything to me  except,  I liked it.|sd
A|I, I,  kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere,|sd
A|so,|%
B|He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now.|sd
B|I think he got out of the lower end market. And decided,|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|but, the houses here in, in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|well but, still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, heavily wooded off the golf course.|sd
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|and the guy around the corner is being transferred|sd
B|so he said, uh, well, he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars,|sd
B|let's see what,|^h
B|I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek, or, if it was eighty and a hundred.|sd
A|Well Yeah.|b
A|Probably  eighty.|sv
B|I think  it was sixty, eighty.|ar
A|Sixty, eighty.|b^m
B|I think.|h
A|Well because, I know our, our little house over here stuck in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, I think fifty five,|sd
A|so, I think the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there|sv
B|Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot|ad
B|No,|ar
B|it could not be,|sv
B|because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet,|sd
B|and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Just never.|sv
A|Well|%
B|Now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for, uh, brand new,|sv
B|or that's pretty much what it was built for.|sv
B|It's got an awful lot of nice things in it|sd
B|but, you know, I don't think, I think it's going to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really, uh, desirable.|sv
B|It's seems like people go for square footage only now|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, cause. Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back here?|qy
A|Um, the ones that look like brick houses|br
B|The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I think those are awful.|sv
A|I'm sorry,|fa
A|I just don't see the designer's,|sd
A|I just see him as trying to squish as much space, you know, as much house into the space as possible.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well see that's,|%
A|the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I,|sd
A|because there's just the two of us|sd
A|and the two cats, um, can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard.|sd
A|And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know.|sd
B|See, when you have kids, you like to be able to, send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|But, I have been watching these houses go up|sd
B|and I, I don't, well,|%
B|somebody was telling me,|sd
B|I know somebody who lives back there,|sd
B|I have always questioned the quality of construction|sd
B|and I, I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house.|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house.|sd
A|Oh, that's amazing.|ba
A|Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a deck put on in back,|sd
A|and these guys are phenomenal.|sd
A|They just, they, they are doing such a terrific job back there,|sd
A|I mean, you know, you pay for it too,|sd
A|but it's, it's like, really worth it.|sd
A|They are putting in a deck, a redwood deck,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job.|sd
B|We have got three different levels of decking, because, this lot slopes way back down|sd
A|I'm really excited about it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, the house is built around the trees.|sd
A|Great.|ba
B|And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up|sd
B|so, it's real, real shady.|sd
B|But, that's one of the few things that really, uh, immediately pays back on return.|sd
B|But, what I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|when the people from M C I come down|sd
B|and they are, you know, they are used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial look  what the,|sd
A|Looks like  the George Town brownstone|bf
B|Right,|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars,  which is probably  about what their equity is, that they got out of selling their house.|sv
A|Must be a dream.|^2
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because those things are selling like hot cakes.|sd
B|But, one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred  dollars  a month.|sd
A|Oh.|b

A|Yes, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|I think that it has to really hit home before, the message sometimes.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Or you have to grow up with it being important in your life, um, oh, oh, um, before the message really takes hold sometimes.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, I don't know,|h
A|it's, uh it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am than I, even myself, than I used to be, a few years ago.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, like I, I'd go to the, um, to the U T D, um, cafeteria for lunch sometimes|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they use styrofoam plates, when they wouldn't, need to use styrofoam plates.|sd
B|Um.|b
B|Right.|b
A|You know, and I think to myself that's, that's crazy.|sd
A|I wonder if, you know, maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and, and, uh, I'm seeing more and more of that,|sd
A|and, and I think it's, uh, just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of, of styrofoam, uh, boxes that they use, for hamburgers and stuff,|sd
B|Right.|sd
A|I think is a good, good example, you know, that even, industry is willing to do it.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|I, I think the big question too we're looking at is, would you be willing to pay more for a product, so it can be recycled.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I think that may, that's kind of what it's coming to, I'm sure.|sv
B|That's, that's right|aa
B|and, and, uh, do we have to wait until all the landfills, are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage.|qh
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|That's right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|Or, and I don't,|%
B|with the mind set of the American public, I think what they will do is start paying Mexico That isn't, that isn't harmful. *sv|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Wow.|ba
A|That doesn't , wouldn't surprise me.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah. I know it,|b
B|That's the way we solve problems.|sv
A|and unfortunately.|%
B|And it's sad.|sv
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what kind of house do you live in?|qw
B|Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas|sd
B|and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back|sd
B|and, It's about thirty-five hundred square feet.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.|sv
A|I live in one,|sd
A|I don't have a swimming pool.|sd
A|And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But the four bedrooms|sd
A|and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike.|sd
A|I think it's pretty much typical for this area.|sv
B|It is.|aa
B|Have you been living there very long?|qy
A|I've been in the house|no
A|I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.|sd
B|So you've been there longer.|sd
B|We built this one about, uh,|sd
B|it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we subcontracted it out ourselves.|sd
B|We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then we subbed it out,|sd
B|so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I bet you,|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My husband got his big garage.|sd
B|He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines|sd
B|and, so he has all the work space he needs.|sd
A|Well, that sounds interesting.|ba
A|I bet he's enjoyed having it that way|ba
B|He,|%
A|because|%
A|kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.|sv
B|It is,|aa
B|and that's why we decided to build.|sd
B|We looked at things that were already, uh, built|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.|sd
A|Well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're kind of rare.|sd
B|So we put a three car garage in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.|sd
B|All of it was taken up with just car space.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well that,|%
A|my, we've just got a two car garage,|sd
A|but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.|sd
B|Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.|sv
A|Now, mine does not work on cars,|ar
A|he just piddles on this and that.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|ba
A|But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.|ba
A|It really is.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,|sv
A|and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having,|%
A|and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I, someone,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.|sd
B|Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.|sd
B|His parents come|sd
B|and also the kids have friends who come and stay|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I still,|%
A|all three of my daughters are married,|sd
A|but, I don't know,|h
A|I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|Oh, I understand|aa
A|And we've got grandchildren now,|sd
A|so when they come, they have to have a place.|sd
B|Well, we,|%
B|That's true|aa
B|and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|you sure don't.|aa
A|At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.|sd
B|Well, I I haven't reached that point yet.|sd
B|I've heard people say that.|sd
B|But, uh, my middle son is engaged,|sd
B|my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|He's out of college and has a good job,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,|sd
B|but she's still in college|sd
B|and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's what she plans to do.|sd
A|Well, I don't blame you for that.|ba
B|So, I hope so.|sd
A|Well, I have the three girls|sd
A|and then we ended up with four grandsons.|sd
B|Oh, ho-ho.|ba
A|And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.|sd
B|A whole new world.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses|sd
B|I can understand.|aa
A|It feels,|%
A|after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,|sd
A|they know everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, they're fun.|sd
B|So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.|bf
A|Well, I just watch them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I I never did put things up when my kids were little|sd
A|and I haven't with them.|sd
A|I try to teach them not to get into things.|sd
B|Well, that's the same thing that I did.|sd
B|I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.|sd
A|I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.|sv
A|At least my daughters have.|sd
A|They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.|sd
A|So it's worked pretty well.|sd
A|There's,|%
A|I don't really think anything's been broken.|sd
A|Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.|sd
B|Um, uh-huh|b
A|But, all in all, they mind pretty well.|sd
A|But, I guess most of the|%
A|what kind of roof does your house have?|qw

B|Oh, I don't know.|no
A|Yeah,|b
A|okay,|%
A|well back to crime,|sd
A|I guess we're supposed to talk about that.|sv
A|They say what aspect are you worried about,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex,|sd
B|you know, there's so much going on here.|sv
A|I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.|sd
B|Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|golly|ba
A|I know.|aa
B|and,|%
A|Have they done that in Garland?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I,|%
B|not that I'm aware of.|sd
A|Now, um,|%
B|I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so, um,|%
A|Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school,|sd
A|so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.|sv
B|Uh-huh. Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|So. Yeah,|b
A|it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school|sd
A|and you wonder if he's going to get shot.|sd
A|I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.|sd
B|I know|aa
A|What next?|qh
B|I know,|aa
B|it's, it's, it's getting,|sv
B|it's been out of hand, I think, for a while,|sv
B|and it just continues to get worse.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this,|sv
A|they just can't do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's,|%
B|I|%
B|I agree,|aa
B|I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right|b
A|and,|%
B|and that may impact it as well.|sv
A|I think so,|aa
A|and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all|sv
B|Yeah|aa
A|I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.|sv
B|they don't think twice about it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,|h
A|I think it was just rare,|sv
A|I really do.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now.|sd
A|She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California,|sd
A|and she was dating this millionaire's son|sd
A|and he wanted to marry her,|sd
A|and she wouldn't marry him|sd
A|and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,|sd

B|You're kidding.|ba
A|No,|aa
A|I'm the one,|%
B|Himself and her?|qy
A|Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,|sd
A|but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks|sd
B|Oh, wow,|ba
B|I bet.|ba
A|but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas|sv
B|Oh, I know,|aa
A|it's just, you know, another killing.|sv
B|Well, they were,|%
B|I was watching some show the other day,|sd
B|and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently,|sd
B|and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,|sd
A|Um.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|lots of their picture and life story and everything.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|and then you get to their life story,|sd
B|Oh, they came from a broken family|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|oh this person had mental problems|sd
A|Right.|b
B|oh duh, duh, duh you know,|^q
A|Right.|b
A|I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I think it was on a Hard Copy,|sd
A|she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,|sd
B|Uh, I remember seeing that,|sd
A|Remember that?|qy
B|I saw that on Hard Copy|na
A|Right,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|that's, uh,|%
B|Yes.|aa
A|My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.|sd
B|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|can you believe it,|qh
A|that's just, uh,|%
B|I'm trying to remember,|^h
B|he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something|sd
A|Taco Bueno,|sd
A|right,|aa
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and he just shot them himself and her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|aa
B|I remember seeing that.|sd
A|Yeah, uh, uh,|b
A|isn't that weird?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|there's just too many crazy people out there these days.|sv
A|I know,|aa
A|and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.|sv
A|You know, he was just begging her on the phone,|sv
A|that's not doing anything.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids|sd
A|not be a very good conversationalist on fishing.|sd
A|I don't do a lot of it.|sd
B|Well, I do love to fish.|sd
A|Well good,|ba
A|maybe I can learn something.|sv
B|Well, I don't know how much you can learn.|arp_nd
B|I'm not so sure I'm good at it,|sd
B|but I do enjoy doing it.|sd
A|Do you?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, it is fun, what little I do.|sd
A|Of course, I don't, you know,|h
A|I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing|sd
A|I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm|sd
A|He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about|sd
B|Well, I hope it is,|sd
B|there's not a whole lot of different kinds.|sd
A|That's about the only kind I know how to do.|sd
B|I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,|sd
B|I, because I get seasick,|sd
B|but we have a lot of lakes here in this area|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I do a lot of fishing for, uh, bass.|sd
B|We have a lot of, uh, uh, couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.|sd
A|Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.|bf
B|I do.|aa
B|Uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,|sd
B|and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Fishing's a good way to do that,|sd
B|and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing.|sd
A|Do you have a boat?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I don't.|sd
B|I have a friend who has a little inflatable raft,|sd
B|and we use that sometimes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I wish I had a boat,|sd
B|but I don't.|sd
A|I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas.|sd
A|The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes, you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That's the same way here, isn't it?|qy
A|Is it?|qy
B|You have to get back in the sticks in the,|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|My in-laws live on a lake, uh, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,|sd
A|and the lake is beautiful,|sd
A|and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,|sd
A|but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.|sd
A|I catch a lot of little old, uh, I think they call them perch|sd
B|Right.|aa
A|and then the, the, uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit|sd
B|We don't have, We don't have a big problem with turtles,|sd
A|but it's kind of fun.|sd
B|but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.|sd
A|Um I would be afraid of that.|sd
B|And I, Well, I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them.|sd
A|Do they ever get on your hook?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|we, uh,|%
B|occasionally I'll catch an eel on a, on a hook, but never the snakes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They just kind of,|%
A|Are they poisonous snakes?|qy
B|Uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,|sd
B|so yes|ny
B|they are, definitely|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in,|sd
B|so I seem them swimming by every once in a while.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|We, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.|sd
A|It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.|sd
A|Great big snake,|sd
A|and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know,|sd
A|but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you, you know.|sd
A|But it looked so bad|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,|sd
A|but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know|sd
B|Definitely.|aa
A|But they're scary looking.|sv
B|Do you have bass?|qy
A|Yes, uh,|ny
A|I think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, that's pretty much the same way here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I,|%
A|Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments.|sd
B|Well, we have those.|sd
B|I don't|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well that's kind of,|%
A|we've never entered a tournament or anything.|sd
A|We're not that big into fishing,|sd
A|but I see a lot of people,|sd
A|you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,|sd
A|and they'll say, Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,|sd
A|and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.|sd
B|Oh, yes.|ba
A|So I think there's a lot of people that have, you know, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,|sv
A|they're really into it to try to win.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|oh, definitely.|aa
A|My.|%
B|Certainly here they are.|sd
A|But it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.|sv
A|The peace and calmness is really relaxing.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's what I do a lot.|sd
A|I've never tried taking a book with me.|sd
A|I'll have to try that one of these days.|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter|sd
A|you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out.|sd
B|It's a good game though.|sv

A|One of the two, uh,|sd

B|I, I agree.|aa
B|It definitely has changed.|sv

A|Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.|sv

B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do,|h
A|but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either|sd

B|Right.|b

A|but I'm just speaking overall across the country.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Something is definitely wrong.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing,|sv
A|so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year|sv
A|and they truly can't read|sv
B|Right.|b
A|so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math.|sd
A|So, um, that's definitely a problem.|sv
A|Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, um,|%
B|So do you, what do you think is good about the schools?|qw
A|That is good about,|%
A|well, it depends on where you are.|sv
A|They're all so different.|sv
A|That's another thing about the United States.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|There's no national curriculum, you know,|sd
A|I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class|sd
A|you may have half literature for the whole year,|sd
A|whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature,|sd
B|Grammar.|b^m
A|it's up to the teacher, in other words.|sv
A|So that's kind of you know, that's kind of odd to me.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or is how you end up|sv
A|Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,|sd
A|so I guess we lucked out when we moved here.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, yeah,|b
B|that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point,|sd
A|and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So.|%
B|But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?|qy
A|I don't know.|no
A|I just read about that the other day,|sd
A|and I had never even thought of it.|sd
A|Actually it makes sense to a certain extent,|sv
A|because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh,|sd
A|they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know. and according to her plan,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|That's, that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more more citizens percentage wise that can read and write,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.|sv
A|I don't know.|sd
A|Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet,|sv
A|so I probably can't|sv
A|But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write|sv
A|because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read.|sd
B|Uh-huh. Yeah *aa|b
A|So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades|sv
A|and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago,|sd
A|and that's a big jump.|sv
B|I believe that|aa
A|Did you go to school in Plano?|qy
B|I did.|na
A|Through high school.|qy^d
B|Uh-huh,|ny
B|uh,|%
A|Up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?|qy
B|We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem.|sd
A|Do you really?|bh
B|Our summers are extremely, uh, hazardous|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and during, uh, certain wind directions because we get the, uh, Gary, Indiana Chicago pollution|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh coming up along the lake.|sd
A|That's horrible.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|In the winter it's not as severe.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,|sv
B|but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, triggering, uh, awareness.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|So what's the conditions like in Dallas?|qw
A|Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver.|sd
A|I grew up in Denver,|sd
A|and, and I've lived there most of my life,|sd
A|and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days.|sd
A|Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down,|sd
A|probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|Uh, due to that the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.|sd
B|Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for, uh, their pollution control equipment,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So, they've, they've tried to do a lot of that|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I|%
B|you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets,|sd
B|and we were talking earlier about Madison|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in Wisconsin|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use of any of the states.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And there is a, a real promotion of, of biking|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, um, there are still a lot of people who insist on, on driving their own automobiles uh, to go everywhere.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I find that a little irritating, because I don't think it's always so necessary.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|it, it becomes, uh,|%
A|maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is.|sv
A|Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be.|sd
B|Send, send them to Wisconsin,|ad
B|and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, uh, the, uh, acid rain|oo_co_cc
A|Oh really|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they'll, they'll, they may wake up, you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|%
B|how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain.|qh
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here.|sv
A|Do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles|qy
A|or does it come mostly from industry up there?|qy
B|I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of, of the Gary area|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that causes the acid rain.|%
B|That I'm a little uncertain of,|sd
B|but I do know that, uh, it is a problem.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I had talked with my parents.|sd
A|I, I grew up, uh, I was born in, uh, Muncie, Indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute,|sd
A|and I had asked them before, uh,|sd
A|I went back to visit recently, about a year ago,|sd
A|and I asked them,|sd
A|I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was,|sd
A|I'm sorry, um|fa
B|That's okay,|bd
B|I didn't hear.|sd
A|hobbies.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|Let me see,|^h

B|I like, uh, most sports.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do you like to do?|qo
A|Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it|sd
B|Well, I'm sure you probably are.|ba

A|not really.|bd
B|You like it,|sv
B|that's the main .|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative, but not the ones that give me the ability to be.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|So, I always try.|sd
A|I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity.|sd
A|Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm,|sd
B|Oh, boy, that's hard sewing.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, it isn't and it is.|aap_am
A|It is, you know,|%
A|actually the sewing isn't the hard part,|sd
A|it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room.|sv
B|Measure it and get it to,|bf
B|Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it.|aap_am
B|If you get pleats and all kinds of,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I've been doing that|sd
A|and, That,|%
B|That's a lot of work.|ba
A|yeah,|aa
A|that,|%
A|but usually have to do the pleats by hand.|sd

B|Oh.|b

A|Yeah,|b
A|and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through|sd

B|That feels really good.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it.|sd
B|To do it,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish.|sd
A|Keeping fish, I guess is my biggest hobby.|sd
B|Keeping fish .|b^m
B|Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.|sv
A|Um, yes and no.|aap_am
A|It depends on how frequently they die, and how much that bothers you.|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
B|How much that bothers you,|b^m
B|and you probably have to clean out the tank too.|sv
A|That's,|%
A|you don't have to do as much as, as I thought.|arp_nd
A|In fact, my problem,|%
A|I had fish as a kid|sd
A|and they always died immediately,|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean|sv
B|Oh, you're kidding|ba
A|because you have,|%
B|because they need to have a little bit of the,|bf
A|Right,|aa
A|you need to let the bacteria build up,|sv
A|and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.|sv
B|I see.|b
A|And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|and it would kill all the bacteria,|sd
A|and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again|sd
B|And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably.|bf
A|so.|%
A|Right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
A|So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|and I don't try and sterilize things|sd
B|Don't go through the whole nine yards|bf
B|and they kind of need a little bit of that.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|So you've had fish for a long time.|bf
A|Well, I've had them,|%
A|I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here,|sd
A|and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank.|sd
A|But that never worked well. I have fifty-five gallons now. *sd|sd
B|What size do you have now?|qw
B|Oh, that's a good size.|ba
A|It's a lot easier.|sd

A|No|nn
A|No,|nn
A|not yet.|sd
B|Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.|sv
A|That's right,|aa
A|I really do.|sd
A|But, you know.|%
B|Do you have all kinds of different fish|qy
B|or,|%
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I just have, you know, what they call community fish guppies, and platies and, and basic things.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't get into the|sd
B|Real exotic.|^2
A|right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|The expensive ones.|sd
B|Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of|sv
B|and,|%
A|They are.|aa
A|They're very expensive|sd
A|and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment.|sv
B|Yes,|b
B|I bet it is.|ba
A|You lost an investment|sv
A|so,|%
B|Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|not really.|sd
A|Only if there's baby fish.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You always have to isolate those.|sd
B|Then you have to,|%
B|how do you isolate them?|qw
A|You get a|sd
B|A jar or something|qy^d
B|or.|%
A|well, no,|nn
A|they have breeders.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|It's a little plastic things that sort of floats|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|and you put the mother fish in there|sd
A|and then it's got like a trough underneath her|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough|sd
A|and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And that's, you know,|%
A|it kind of works,|sd
A|but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate|sd
B|Right.|b
A|it'll fit out the slots.|sd
B|It'll go through the slot.|bf
A|That's right,|aa
A|so. But, you know, it works, I guess.|sd
B|That works all right then.|qy^d
B|They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.|bf
A|Oh, they'll eat them.|sd
B|They will.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Isn't that odd.|qy
A|Yes.|ny
B|You wouldn't think that.|sv

B|You're kidding.|ba
A|Oh, no.|aa
A|All the time,|sd
A|and, um, I,|%
A|and she's supposed to,|%
A|her variety, it says they won't eat the babies,|sd

A|So.|%
B|And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?|qy
A|Oh, it's|%
A|well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different|sd
B|Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.|bf
A|We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't,|sd
A|but you know, that's the way it is for them.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's kind of the way they do it.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's it.|aa
B|Survival of the fittest or something.|bf
A|Yes,|aa
A|because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough and go hide.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Go hide from them,|bf
B|well and then, you think, well, how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that,|qh
A|So.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.|qy^d
A|No,|nn

A|I, I try.|sd
A|I also, I play a couple of instruments.|sd
A|Well, uh, I don't know.|h
A|I think the budget is really out of hand right now,|sv
A|and especially in this election year, I think that, uh, there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering, you know, their token little tax cut program, you know, when it's when it's just such a bad time for it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right,|b
A|and, uh, well, as you said, mostly they are token cuts.|sv
A|Uh  especially what, for instance, George Bush is offering.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|The ninety-seven cents a week|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|ninety-seven cents a week.|aa

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Another ninety-seven cents,|sd
A|hell you can buy a coke or something for that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut,|sv
B|it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld, you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, yeah|b
B|I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot.|sv
A|That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either.|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|Uh, I, I haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either,|sv
A|especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I mean, you know, in retrospect, um, was it, was it Mondale or Dukakis that said, you know, I'll, I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes?|qy
A|I believe it was Dukakis|sv
B|It was Dukakis,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|but I, I can't.|%
B|I have a lot of respect for him|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said, No,|sv
A|I will not and then, you know, ten months later he said, well, sorry, you know, I, I can't follow through on this.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it seems to me that, uh, that the budget is so out of hand,|sv
A|and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over|sv
A|and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of,  you know  of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go,|sd
A|because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace, so-called  peace dividend.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's.|%
A|I mean, if they could actually put something together and make,|sd
A|I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste money, also,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties, or whatever.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|I, uh, I, I think that would be a great idea, you know, like the conservation corps, you know where.|sv
A|Right, Exactly|aa
B|It it it would help unemployment greatly.|sv
B|And it.|%
A|and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|infra structure is in, is in,|%
B|I mean, we, we, we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty  years in the  cold war.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and  and there's no way that we can ever really recover from, from the state that we're in right now, unless, at least I feel, unless we focus on the infra structure,|sv
A|and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree totally|aa
B|Um, I mean, this, this, it just seems so, you know, so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen.|sv

B|what,|%
B|I had you know, the required political science class a couple of years ago.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And one of the things we discussed was, you know, where our, where the budget how the budget situation just got so out of hand.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And essentially what happened was,|%
B|I think it was like in the, um, tax year of eighty-one, um,|sd
B|Ronald Reagan basically said, you know, I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and, and, created this, this ludicrous budget that he knew, that, that, um, that the Congress would not in their right mind pass|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, you know, bye-bye, you know, bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and created, you know, that, that, that, you know, created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And you just, .|%
A|You, you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington.|sv

A|Yeah,|aa
A|uh, well, it's, it's more than a loaded,|%
A|it's a loaded cannon.|sv
A|I mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job of spending that money. Uh-huh. *b|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|um, what really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were to say, you know, well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're , we're going to have to do some unpopular things, I mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected.|sv
B|I mean, it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing, you know where people just want, want to have, you know, whatever will make them feel good, right now, you know.|sv
A|For, for the moment,|aa
A|and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said|^q

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|It,|%

B|Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,|sv
B|and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .|sv
A|I probably agree with that.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh.|%
B|You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.|sv
B|They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's probably true.|aap_am
A|Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?|qy
B|Um, well, I've been to,|%
B|I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.|na
B|Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't think it's as bad as L A either.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|We, I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that seems to be true.|aa
B|Um, yeah,|%
B|if you've ever been to like New York City|%
B|and you can just, you can just, as you walk through the street on a given evening, you can see crimes being committed.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's that obvious.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|You know, walk you know, walk with, you know, with just walk in a confidently,|sv
B|With a big stick|^2
B|or.|qy
A|and, you know, don't, don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Sure.|ba
B|Right,|aa
B|don't, don't walk down a, an alley|sv
B|or don't get|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, yeah,|%
B|there are times when you can't avoid all that|sv
A|Uh.|%
B|and, and then you're kind of on your own|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|have you, have you ever, have you ever been mugged in Atlanta?|qy
B|Uh, no.|nn
B|The only thing I've ever had, was I've had my wallet lifted|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but that was in a more of a, a setting where there was a number of people around,|sd
B|and I kind of got,|%
B|I was much younger at the time|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and kind of a couple of people, they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off, so I didn't know who had it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've had that happen,|sd
B|but that's, that's about it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged.|sd
A|Um.  Yeah,|%
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I think I've only actually seen like one, you know, one actual robbery with a gun|sd
B|Um.|%
A|and that's been about the only, you know, real violent crime where, you know, potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta.|sd
B|Really,|ba
B|well, I've had my.|%
A|And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've had my car stolen,|sd
B|so maybe that counts.|sv
A|Oh, really.|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Oh, where was, where, where was that?|qw
A|Was that downtown|qy
A|or,|qy
B|Oh no,|nn
B|that was in the northern um, up near Cumberland Mall area.|sd
A|Really.|ba
B|It's actually Cobb County,|sd
B|but it is Atlanta|sd
A|Metropolitan,|^2
A|yeah.|aa
B|and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I've actually, I've known, known some people that have had their cars stolen.|sd
A|Uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem to, the A P D seems to recover them, you know in various states of disrepair Up on blocks.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah|b
A|My friend had a V W Rabbit,|sd
A|and when he, when he got it back his, um, dashboard was sitting in the front seat|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|mine was just, it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage,|sd
B|but they didn't, they didn't strip it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I got it back.|sd
A|Well, you're probably luckier than.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|than most.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, so like does insurance pay for the body damage,|qy
A|or was that all there was, body.|qy
B|Right.|na
B|It was about three grand to put everything together.|sd
B|They cracked the steering column of course, to steal the car.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you got to, you crack the steering column|sd
B|and you pull the,|sd
B|there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you can start it up, basically pretty easily.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So how do you know this much about, um, stealing cars?|qw
B|Well, after I found mine I had to, I had this,|sd
A|Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list|qy
A|and their either offering a service|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|or they're introducing some new product in the area|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|and normally when they call, you're either in the shower,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|or you're in the middle of cooking something|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|and you have to stop everything to run to the phone.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yes,|ny
B|yes.|ny
B|Is, is that one that you're talking about.|qy
A|That was the big one I'm talking about.|na
A|I work weird hours,|sd
A|and invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,|sd
A|you either hear, the as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already.|sd
B|That's true,|aa
B|or the ones that are, are generated by a computer.|sd
B|It's just a computer voice that comes on the line.|sd
B|Those are the ones that I really, really hate too.|sd
A|I've even had some of them,|sd
A|the, they're voice activated|sd
A|and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|sometimes I, I get them on my, uh, answering machine at home|sd
B|so, and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages|sd
B|and I go through them|sd
B|and most of them aren't from anybody at all.|sd
A|What I would love to see done to stop all of this,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we've got a thing in this country,|sd
A|you can have your phone number unlisted,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people,|sv
A|I think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything,|sv
A|but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes,|aa
B|see I have an unlisted telephone number,|sd
B|but I still get all of those calls|sd
B|and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand.|sd
B|So, yeah,|ny
B|I do,|sd
B|I really feel that's, uh, an invasion of my privacy.|sd
B|I agree with you on that particular subject there.|aa
B|Let me see.|^h
A|That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences,|%
A|I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products.|sd
A|If I wanted their products, I would have either gone to the store to bought it,|sd
A|or I would have called for their salesman to come out.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
B|Living in an apartment complex though, you know you can't, um, you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, uh,|sd
B|but they still come up to the front door and, uh, you know, walk around.|sd
B|So, usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey, there's people coming around, you know,|sd
B|and they're trying to sell something|sd
B|or, or they're from a religious organization|sd
B|and I really hate that.|sd
B|I really, really do.|sd
B|I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago|sd
B|and, uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too.|sd
B|It wasn't even what I would consider, you know, family hours,|sd
B|time to, you know, start going to bed|sd
B|and uh, and it was somebody from, um, oh what was it, the, uh, Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,|sd
B|and uh, I've read a lot about, uh, that particular sect|sd
B|and I don't particularly care for it,|sd
B|so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and, and try and talk to me.|sd
A|Now, I agree with their right to, uh, pursue their religion of choice, in that, whatever manner they want to,|sv
A|but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an apartment.|sv
A|I'm on my turf,|sd
A|if I want them there, I'll call for them,|sd
A|otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|no,|aa
B|I, I agree with you there.|aa
B|If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, you know, as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in.|sv
B|And, and I don't like the way that they do it either,|sd
B|and, and, it's their mission that they do it.|sd
B|They go door to door|sd
B|and they go out into the public|sd
B|and they actually have the, uh, teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work|sd
B|and, uh, I don't know,|h
B|I just, um, don't particularly care for that at all.|sd
B|And that, that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though, is, uh, you know, people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh, you know, to try and get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion,|sv
B|because I have my own.|sd
A|Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting,|sd
A|I've even gone so far as to put that,|%
A|I've got a storm door on the front of the house|sd
A|and I've put, in,|%
A|I don't know how much clearer it can be,|sd
A|it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.|sd
A|I should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|No|aa
B|I don't, uh, I don't have, I didn't go that far|sd
B|but, uh, yeah|%
B|I probably could do the same thing, uh, you know,|sv
B|I don't have a storm door,|sd
B|but I'm sure I could rig up something.|sd
B|But you know I don't think that that would stop people.|sv
B|I, it's like they see that word|sv
B|and it says go instead of stop.|sv
B|Oh, goodness.|ba
A|and then reverse it,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|and do,|%
A|well that would be technically illegal,|sd
A|it would be harassment.|sd
B|Oh gosh.|ba
A|But, I consider an invasion of my privacy, a harassment in itself.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|that's true, um.|aa
B|Well what else?|qo
A|I believe we've pretty much summed everything up.|sv
B|I know,|aa
B|but I remember you, you talked about something,|^h
B|you started off and said,|^h
B|well let me think,|^h
B|you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door.|^h
B|You said something else.|^h
B|I can't remember what it was,|^h
B|and I thought yeah,|sd
B|that, that kind of touched a nerve right there,|sd
B|but we got uh, we got to talking about the, uh, uh, people coming to you at the front door.|sd
A|I'm drawing a blank.|^h
B|Oh goodness,|ba
B|okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|is our five minutes up?|qy
A|Uh, pretty close to it.|na

B|Okay. Well, no that's really when I grew up,|aa
A|And, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind?|qy
A|No,|ba
A|not a seventies baby.|qy

B|I mean,|%
A|Is it disco,|qy
A|or is it like,|qrr
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|not that kind of music|sd
A|but,|%
B|No,|nn
B|more like, uh, rock, um, you know, like Led Zepplin type|sd
A|Oh, okay.|b
A|So, so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin.|bf
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's cool.|aa
B|Right.|b
A|And, how about the Rolling Stones?|qy
B|Oh, sure,|ba
B|sure|ba
B|I went to their concert last year when they were here.|sd
A|Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured.|sd
A|How about, um, Pink Floyd?|qy
B|Sure,|na
B|yeah,|ny
B|I like them.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|So, so then we got, we got some same things|sv
A|because,|%
B|Okay,|b
B|well, I just didn't know that much about music|sd
B|and I wasn't sure what kind of music.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|it's very hard|sv
A|because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, you know,|%
A|I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.|sd
B|What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about?|qw
B|What,|%
A|We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.|sd
B|Okay,|bk
B|like, give me some examples.|ad
A|Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company,|sd
A|what,|%
B|Oh, well, Bad Company's not bad,|sv
B|that's not,|%
A|well, they're like, for example, A C D C.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|A C D C|b^m
A|Why,|qo
A|have you heard of them?|qy
B|Yes|ny
A|Okay.|bk
A|And, stuff like that.|sd
A|That's, that's, that's not really hard rock.|sv
B|Well, okay.|b
B|Okay,|ba
B|I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.|sv
A|Okay.|bk
B|I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like Cinderella, you know.|sd
A|Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal.|sd
B|Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella|sd
B|But, I like A C D C's okay.|sd
A|But, see, for example, they have, see what,|sd
A|but other bands consider it like really hard rock.|sd
A|It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar,|sd
A|and the guitar is set like, really low,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|No,|b
B|I don't really care for that too much, I guess.|sd
A|and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music|sd
A|and then they start dancing around,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they just bump into each other,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, then, you knock people down,|sd
A|and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.|sd
B|Is that the kind of music that you like?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I don't like that music.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|But, that's, that's what they do.|sd
A|That's, that's what some people call like really heavy metal.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also.|sd
A|Like really, like heavy metal, is considered, like the words heavy metal|sd
A|and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, just hard rock has,|%
A|they, they don't talk about that,|sd
A|they just talk about, like, life in general.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.|qy^d
B|Oh, sure.|na
B|Of course.|na
A|Yeah.|b
B|you, you're talking Queen,|bf
B|is that what you said?|br

A|especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera?|h
A|Don't they have a,|qy
A|no|ar
A|let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in the background.|qw^d
B|Oh! Right,|ba
A|Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.|sd
B|right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that was great.|sv
A|I heard that the other day on the radio|sd
A|and I pumped it up.|sd
A|Because, I mean, I just love that song.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that, that was a real good one.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|but they had,|%
A|that, that whole record was pretty good.|sv
A|But then, they started going downhill like everybody else.|sv
B|Well, that's true.|aa
B|They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|they're, they're still around,|sd
A|they've got a new C D out,|sd
A|but I, I wouldn't buy it.|sd
A|Because see, what happens is, the old, see|sd
A|I like, I like the old Rolling Stones.|sd
A|I don't like the new stuff.|sd
B|Of the Stones?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
B|That's the|%
B|the older stuff is the best of it.|sv
B|The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I, don't really care for today's rock and roll too much.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yes,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this,|sd
A|and then he came out with, uh, see, for example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That was good,|sv
A|but it was on his way of going downhill,|sv
A|because he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone,|sd
A|and then he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis|sd
A|and that really,|%
A|like now, I hate Phil Collins,|sd
A|I can't stand him.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Because, I look at him|sd
A|and I say, you know, you were singing at this time, and with these people,|sd
A|and you were great,|^q
A|and now you're singing all this stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record,|^q
A|it's still going to be a number one hit.|^q
A|And so, that's, that's what gets me mad.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|not yet.|sd
B|I guess I've been, kind of considering it.|sd
B|Have you seen it yet?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|I saw it when it opened.|sd
B|Was it really good?|qy
A|Yeah. you know, like those guys that criticize movies?|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|na
A|And, they both loved the movie, right?|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They said the music's great,|sd
A|it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that.|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, one of them said, well, everything is great,|sd
A|but I'm going to give it thumbs down.|^q
A|And they go,|sd
A|but why?|^q
A|Because it's like, the end is, like, really depressing.|sd
A|And so,|%
B|Oh.|b
A|But it, but it's like the movie is so well made,|sv
A|and the music that goes with it just picks you up, see,|sv
A|I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Did, did you go to college?|qy
B|Well, no.|nn
B|I'm going right now|sd
A|Oh, that's cool.|ba
B|But uh, no|nn
B|I didn't go then.|sd
B|But see, I graduated high school in seventy-eight,|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really heavy, you know,|sd
B|and real, um, I don't know,|h
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|disco was pretty much dead by then.|sd

A|All right, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I think the topic was crime in the city.|sd
B|Right.|aa
A|I do not live in a city.|sd
A|I live in a real small little place.|sd
B|Where is that?|qw
A|Uh, it's about thirty miles from Sherman.|sd
B|North, south, east, or west?|qy
A|It's north of Sherman.|sd
B|Well, you live almost in Oklahoma|sv
A|Not too far.|aap_am
B|Yeah .|b
B|That's kind of ironic, because I don't live too far from Oklahoma either.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|You know where Saint Joe is?|qy
A|Uh, I've been through there.|na
B|I'm about eight miles south of it.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I had been through Saint Joe,|sd
A|but, um, just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad.|sv
B|Well, you know, I've, I've seen those statistics and everything,|sd
B|and you know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert with high tech weaponry, you know,|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I mean, the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry,|sd
B|but they had mortars and machine guns, tanks and all that.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|And, they didn't kill as many people in, in forty-five days,|sd
B|and they were intending to kill people,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I mean, that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C.|sv
A|Oh, I know,|aa
A|I know.|aa
A|I know.|aa
A|Um, I think nowadays people just, really just, murder is nothing to them, you know.|sv
B|Well, I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, I guess.|sd
B|And, I've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought to me, even, that if a guy is convicted, or a gal is convicted, of a crime, rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven not to work, just let them go.|sv
B|Say okay, you're convicted|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and just let them go|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|because, uh, most likely that will happen, won't it, that, you know,|sv
B|Well, I think that the best hope to eliminate crime, as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job.|sv
A|No.|aa
B|You know.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|They can't be accepted into society.|sv
B|You know, if they're not going to be accepted into society, then everybody's going to become sociopathic.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And, you know, who's to put the limit on it?|qh
B|I mean, I was watching a thing last night, up in Washington State.|sd
B|If you get convicted of, uh, sexual offenses, on a regular basis|%
B|You know, I mean, some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And they're still let out on the street after one or two years.|sd
B|Well, in Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let you out.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|So you serve your prison term,|sd
B|and then you go into the mental hospital,|sd
B|and if you're pronounced cured, they'll let you go.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Well, they may find a cure for it,|sv
B|but there is no known cure now.|sd
A|Um. So you're, you're kind of thinking,|bf
A|in other words, if you get, if you do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,|bf
B|Hey , people make mistakes.|sv
A|yeah,|b
A|to go ahead and let them go,|bf
A|but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then, uh.|bf
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|use that|sv
B|or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know,|sv
B|you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against.|sv
A|Oh.|b
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|You know.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|At least they might have get some benefit in that,|sv
B|and if the people they committed a crime against, feel, at some later date, that these people have learned their lesson, are, are okay, you know, well, they can free them.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|But, uh, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar on a guy's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property.|sd
B|I mean, it will just in incapacitate them.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And, you can put a collar around a guy's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|But, you know, putting them in prison, my God, that doesn't work.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|apparently not,|aa
A|because look how many years they've been doing that|sv
A|and look|%
A|I mean, yeah.|%
B|Well, you look at places like Turkey.|ad
B|Turkey has the death penalty, for just about everything.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I mean, if you get convicted of, uh, you know, drug trafficking, they just kill you.|sd
B|You get convicted of, uh, you know, heinous crimes, they just kill you.|sd
B|I mean there's no two ways about it.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And, uh, you look at their society|ad
B|and the repeat offenders are very few.|sv
B|You know, and you look at our society, almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison, has been in prison three or four times.|sv
A|Three or four times,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|I mean, You know, the way to stop that kind of behavior is, is two-fold.|sv
A|That is true,|aa
A|I know.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|One, you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven.|sv
B|I, I think that's very important.|sv
A|Oh, I'm, I agree very much so on that,|aa
A|I,|%
A|yeah.|aa
B|And then, if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason take the kids away from the parents.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because, you know, we are what we teach.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Because that's what our society becomes.|sv
B|We have, We have just a bunch of people,|sd
A|comes,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|and I've, and I've, I've lived in that, that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work.|sd
B|You know, and these guys, they come to work every morning|sd
B|and they're stoned to the bone.|sd
B|I mean, their so high, they could fly up to the top of that building *spelling: they're|sd
B|and they work all day,|sd
B|and they go home|sd
B|and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs|sd
B|and when they run out of money, they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money,|sd
B|and then they go back to work on Monday.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And, the kids of these people .|%
A|Sure,|b
A|they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ...|qy
B|They're sociopathic.|no
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been.|sd
B|I had one kid threaten my life, Threaten my life.|sd
A|In the first grade|ba
B|Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death.|sd
A|Oh, know|sv
B|You know, and they flipping me the finger and all that|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and I just said to this kid,|sd
B|I said, you got two choices kid,|sd
B|you can step into mainstream society|^q
B|or you can die.|^q
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Because you will eventually be killed.|^q
B|And, I just, I'm just totally aghast at a what's going on.|sd
A|Oh, I know.|aa
A|I know, um,|aa
A|I work in school. You know,|sd
A|that's something I do|sd
A|and I, it really is|%
A|I'm like you|sv
A|astonishing what the younger ages know,|sv
A|and they react to what they see at home. You know.|sv
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids at school.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
A|You know. It really is,|sv
A|and that's kind of sad.|sv
B|Well, you can see it in the work place, you know.|sv
B|Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just, you worked with it|sd
B|and you got through it.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Now, you know, people get fired,|sd
B|or what's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Or, one thing or the other.|h
B|You look at another kind of society like the Japanese.|ad
B|You put that many people on that small of a space, they've learned to live together.|sv
B|Okay.|%
B|It's in their culture.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, while Japan was becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those companies, worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five, as they did when they were eighteen.|sv
A|Teen.|b^m
B|And the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people.|sd
B|If they weren't fit for the job they were hired for, they didn't just can them,|sd
B|they made a position for them some where.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|You look at Frito Lay.|ad
B|My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist.|sd
B|You know, transcribing stuff into the computer.|sd

B|and he says how do you get that from there to the material|sd
A|Not that hard.|sv
B|Oh, it's not.|aa
A|I really enjoy it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|it, yeah, it can add up quick.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have,|sd
A|and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know,|sd
A|just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|I see.|ba
B|Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar.|sd

B|Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,  it's  such a big area|sd

A|It doesn't matter to me.|sd
B|Well, uh, I'll tell you something,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|um, I, I have a sister-in-law from Israel,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,  and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.|sd
B|They, they believe that they, they belong there|sd
B|and they've belonged there forever,|sd
B|and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less,|sd
B|they, they consider them second class.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,  they're really quite arrogant about it.|sd
B|I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.|sd
A|Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States intervening with Patriot missiles,|qw
A|did, did they,|%
B|Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,|sv
A|Uh-huh|b
B|but, I  didn't really talk about that with her.|sd
B|She, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, Switzerland.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an,|sd
B|and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them,|sd
B|and they really treat them like second class citizens.|sd
B|They, they don't really want them around|sd
B|but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they, they really do,|sd
B|they look down on them.|sd
B|And, I don't know, being,|%
B|I, I live in, uh, Vermont|sd
B|and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black.|sd
B|We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people|sd
B|because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know,|sd
B|it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.|sv
B|And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals|sd
B|and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs|sd

B|So it's just a different world.|sv
A|Well I live in San Antonio|sd
A|and fifty percent of the population is minority.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,  um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|do they call it the barrio down there.|qy
A|That's the barrios|na
A|but it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city.|sv
A|It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|but I heard that San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it it just has a really bad problem.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  we're just so protected.|sv
B|But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians.|sd
B|You know, the Israelis can do anything they want|sd
B|but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd.|sd
B|Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities|sd
B|and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|So they don't have that.|sd
B|But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq?|qo

A|it,|%
A|I|%
B|It's just what do you do for them,|sv

B|They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us|sv
B|so we're just going to let them go,|^q
B|but really we didn't think about the people that he was going,|sv
B|and I mean, he, he's just,|%
A|Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait.|sd
A|And once that was accomplished it,|sd
B|They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  right,|%
B|what they were going to say.|sd
B|And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So they were, they were playing it very safe,|sv
B|but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done|sd
B|and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because he had the|%
B|he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.|sd
B|it was going to make such a mess.|sd
B|I mean I feel really sorry for these people,|sd
B|these people are middle class people, just like us.|sd
B|Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood,|qh
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  you knew this,|qh
B|these people are going to come|sd
B|and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you.|sd
B|Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry|sv
B|and you're going to run.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.|sv
A|I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come.|sv
A|I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.|sv
B|Well you know what I was hoping?|qh
B|I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know,|sd
B|and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know,|sd
B|but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives,|%
A|They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I know,|aa
B|it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict|sv
B|but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians,|sd
B|why they didn't go save,|%
B|I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish,|%
B|I know the Shiites are their people.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I don't know,|h
B|I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds.|sv
A|There are some Kurds living in Iran.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I think they should have just done more, uh,|sv
B|and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.|sv
B|It's, it's just so complicated.|sv
A|I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|well, you,|%
B|knowing them, they're very, um, oh,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|almost compare them to a very egotistical man.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You're damn right,|aa
B|I'm going to protect my family, you know,|sd
B|so, I, I was amazed too.|sd
B|I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it.|sd
B|But,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.|sv
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|I was, I|%
B|that part scared me.|sd
B|That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out|sd
B|and I just saw atomic bomb,|sv
A|Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um,|sd
A|I, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on|sd
A|and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.|sv
A|That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about,|sd
A|because I, because we never went to war.|sd
A|I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out|sv
A|and I,  I  feel like it went on and on.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And I, I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what was happening.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You know, I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman|sd
A|and I'm not sure that's our role,|sv
A|but.|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I, I agree with that,|aa
B|I was, I was fairly young at the time too,|sd
B|I, I really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And,  uh, my husband is a Vietnam veteran|sd
B|and you know, he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on, he,|%
B|it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have, from the people or the administration, either one.|sd
A|of static throughout Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time?|qy
A|I mean I do think that, it's been too long in coming|sv
A|but I feel like maybe the American people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that  that  those,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|so many people were opposed to the war,|sd
A|what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it|sd
A|and those guys were there doing their duty.|sd
B|That's right,|aa
B|I mean, they weren't there by choice|sv
B|and, and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|and I, I think that we learned from that|sv
A|and I think it, it's one of those things that you learn the hard way.|sv
A|It was a tragic mistake,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|the  way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around. Just now, you know, trying to be rectified|sv
A|and I'm, and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally,  on  so many of the people.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|No,|aa
B|I don't think you can|aa
B|and I, I agree with you that I, I think that the, the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in, in, in every aspect of it|sv
B|and I, I agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.|sv
B|I mean they're still not settled over there.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|they're not.|aa
B|And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not sooner.|sv
A|Well I, I appreciate the|%
A|I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot.|sv
A|He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  then he has backed out,|sd
A|he has pulled out.|sd
A|And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein,|sd
A|so why aren't you helping us?|^q
A|And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.|sv
B|I think it would too.|aa
A|And I don't think the U S will stand for it.|sv
A|I don't think he would do that,|sv
B|No,|aa
A|uh,  I think we learned too much of the effects.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I agree with that.|aa
A|Uh, you know whether it was justified or not, I know, that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.|sv
A|I, I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and,  and  beat the communism,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, but I think somewhere that got lost.  You know,  in the long term effects of the, of the war|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and,|%
B|you have to, you know, you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he, he said that's what we were going there to do|sv
B|and he did what, what he said|sd
B|and he did pull out before it got any further than that where,  where  it would have turned into more of a police action. Uh, or more of a political action I guess, you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as, as another country.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I  mean, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries|sd
B|and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address.|sv
A|That we don't get fixed.|bf
B|That's right.|aa
A|I know.|aa
B|And, and that's what frustrates me more than anything.|sd
A|And I, I believe that we have to have a military|sv
A|and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward.|sv
B|I think there's a lot of waste|sv
B|and, and they don't, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start addressing some of the other issues,|sv
B|I think we could take care of everything. And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world,  you  know, who just end up using things against us later on anyway.|sv
A||b
A|I know,|aa
A|I do think that in the Middle East war, um,|%
A|I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|An, uh, and I think that's good, you know,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I  think that's a good,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|a lot of good has come from this one.|sv
A|I think so too.|aa
B|And I think, I guess, in, in, uh, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war|sv
B|because like we, we said earlier, that, you know, the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of, of that war|sv
B|and and,|%
A|And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly.|aa
A|So, I, I, I do think that, we've learned from it,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you  know, I, I, I wish there weren't war|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|no kidding.|aa
A|But, uh, I do think we learned.|sv
B|And I just, I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid,  for,  you know, nothing.|sd
A|Yes.|aa
B|I mean, it was, they're, they still don't know what they were there for.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal,|sv
A|no,|aa
B|No.|aa
A|we  went in|sd
A|but what did we do.|qh
A|We lost lives|sd
A|and, and what were we trying to do.|qh
A|Who knows.|qh
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|And, I, I think you're right,|aa
A|uh, I think you're right there.|aa
A|Um, I do remember when it was over.|sd
A|I remember when they were coming home.|sd
A|Uh, but, I remember the feeling back then, you know,|sd
A|like I feel like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, yeah,|b
A|there's a lot of people that aren't for war.|sd
A|I'm not for war,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right.|sv
A|I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I just remember,|%
A|oh yeah,|^q
A|our guys are over there|^q
A|and it's sad|^q
A|and we shouldn't be fighting a war|^q
A|but there was no, let's support them, you know.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|the,|%
B|when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and, you know,  their,  all the demonstrations that were going on.|sd
A|Yeah.  That's right.|b
B|I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity|sv
B|because those kind of people, I mean, you know, they're the kind of people who are, who've always got to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent.|sv
B|They've got to have a cause|sv
B|and,  and, I,  you know, nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're, you're supporting the war.|sv
B|you have to support the people that are there.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|And for some reason those people don't see that.|sv
A|They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|no,|aa
B|they don't|aa
B|and, you know, they're just real shallow people.|sv
A|I would agree with you there|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I agree.|aa
A|Um, and I, and I recall when President Bush said that, you know,|sd
A|he said look,|sd
A|I, you know, I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war.|^q
A|There's a lot of us that are opposed to war|^q
A|but, uh, you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing.|^q
A|And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|But,|%
B|I  mean they're not helping anybody.|sv
B|That's the, that's the whole point,|sv
A|not.|%
B|they're not  doing anything for anybody except themselves.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves. You know.|sv
A|Uh.|b
A|Giving a soapbox to stand on|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|But, well, I just, I, I'm glad we've learned.|sd
A|I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm especially sorry for the people that are, you know, have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally,|sd
A|because, you know until the past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that,  for them.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, and I think that's where we as American people really failed, you know, failed them.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b

B|there's, you know, there's benefits|sd

A|and, uh, it was practically new when I moved in here|sd
A|and the carpet was new|sd
A|and,|%
B|Huh.|%
B|Do you live in the high-rise?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|it's not a high-rise.|sd
A|It's just a, a two story building.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|bk
A|Uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings|sd
A|but it's just two stories.|sd
A|Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio|sd
A|but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.|sd
A|On the first floor, um, where I am, there's a patio.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|So, so you just, you have one floor all to yourself?|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|The rooms are nice and large|sd
A|and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms.|sd
A|And, uh, ,|%
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|Do you get your own washer, dryer?|qy
A|Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area|no
A|and I, I did buy the washer and dryer,|sd
A|but they didn't provide it.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them,|sd
A|and that's one of the reasons that I did move.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That is nice.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|So, tell me|ad
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've always, uh, been pretty lucky.|sd
B|The real estate out here's been pretty good.|sd
B|It, uh, the, the prices of, well, the prices came down last year.|sd
B|We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|The past, uh, uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It just , It's a real good ,|sv
B|It just never happened before.|sd
B|So it's really surprising everybody.|sd
B|All the developers don't know what to do|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's a good time to buy, if you're in the market.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|we're, uh, we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we have a three bedroom house.|sd
B|And it's pretty much filled up right now.|sd
A|Oh, so you want a bigger one.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|uh-huh.|ny
B|Get an extra bedroom or a basement.|sd
B|Right now it's just a, a single level rambler.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|One thing about the houses in, uh, in Dallas, they don't, uh, utilize basements the way they did in New York.|sd
A|My parents in New York had, uh, a, uh, three family house.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Actual a,|%
A|two family house where the, the, um, the downstairs and the second floor they had,|sd
A|and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you know.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, they had a basement,|sd
A|and they, you know, they finished the basement,|sd
A|and they were able to rent that out also.|sd
A|But, uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|And I've looked at a lot of them, you know .|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there,|sd
B|and that's what he said was that, you know, it just wasn't something that people had down there.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|it's|%
B|They put pools and garages on, but, uh, no basements|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|And, uh,|%
B|Maybe it's all the sand.|sv
B|Is there a lot of sand in,|qy
B|I always think it's like a desert,|sd
B|I don't know.|h
B|Dallas always,|%
A|Well, no.|ar
A|No,|ar
A|no,|ar
A|no,|ar
A|you know, I don't see that kind of sand here. Um,|sd
A|there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the, to the, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or the foundation is sinking or something. You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.|sd
A|But you, you have to know the right spot, to, to pick where that doesn't happen.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh ,|%
B|Well, out here we, um, we live in what used to be, uh, like a prairie or whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, they,|%
B|it's just, you go down four inches|sd
B|and you get to well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast|sd
A|I see.|b
B|It's just solid sandstone.|sd
A|Huh.|%
A|Where did you say you're at, Colorado?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|Virginia.|sd
A|Virginia,|b^m
A|Virginia.|b
A|That's right .|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's sort of unusual really.|sv
B|Most of Virginia is clay.|sd
A|Anywhere near, uh, Virginia Beach?|qy^d
B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
B|My, uh, my folks used to live there.|sd
B|Back before I was born, they lived there.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind,|sd
A|in, uh, in Texas I'll say|sd
A|because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, in the, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, uh, Texas is a big state|sd
B|so I imagine the, the type of houses and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well,|%
B|But, uh, that's the same way out here|sd
B|because, um, well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway.|sd
B|That's why we came out here.|sd
B|This is called the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C, twenty-five from the city.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|But, um, it's considered the country since it's, uh, you know, that far out.|sd
A|Well ,|%
B|But, um, yeah,|b
B|we live out by Dulles Airport.|sd
A|I see.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|and, uh, that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia|sd
B|they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here|sd
B|and, you know, it's, it's still pretty rural.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.|sv
B|Land has gotten so expensive|sd
B|they just can't afford to have low income housing like that.|sv
A|So, is your house in an area by itself?|qy
A|I mean,|%
B|No,|nn
B|we're in a development.|sd
A|it's not connected to another one?|qy^d
B|There's, uh,|%
B|yeah,|ny
B|there's another one half an acre away, or a quarter acre away rather.|sd
A|Oh.|%
A|But it's not, they're not connected are they?|qy
B|Oh, no.|nn
B|Huh-uh.|nn
B|You have to, uh, stay in one single family home.|sd
B|I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids|sd
B|but, um, for the most part they, they always had, you know,|sd
B|and Pennsylvania always had a single family home|sd
B|and so, you know, as soon as we could we, we got a single family home,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's all I ever knew growing up,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so. I stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up enough money to, to get a,|sd
A|Hello.|fp
B|Hello|fp
A|Hi, um,|fp
A|this is Betty|fp
A|and I'm in Richardson, Texas.|sd
B|I'm Nola|fp
B|and I'm in Plano.|sd
A|Oh, okay,|b
A|well here we go|sd
A|I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are, that did some stuff over in the Gulf. Um.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|now, did you push one?|qy
A|Yeah, uh,|ny
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|no|nn
A|I haven't pushed one yet.|sd
A|I just,|%
B|Okay,|b
B|but, I think it's,|sd
B|I just started doing this|sd
B|so I don't know too much about it.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|we're just sort of getting acquainted here.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|Um, you know, I, I just wanted to see if, you know, you had an opinion about this,|sd
A|or, you know.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, so, if that's okay with you, then I'll just press one.|oo_co_cc
B|That will be fine.|aa
A|Okay|b
A|Well, hi,|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|Good morning. Um,|fp
A|I think I mean, if, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are,|sv
A|and I mean they think differently|sv
A|and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours.|sv
A|And, and right now, I, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just,|sv
A|well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there,|sv
A|I think we should just leave them alone.|sv
A|I really do. In, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's the way, the course that they should go,|sv
A|I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,|sv
A|but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.|sv
A|The, the thing with Israel and Palestine, I believe that should be settled between them.|sv
A|And also, um, you know, the other thing is their idea, or our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them.|sv
A|I mean, I mean, I'm talking about the whole middle|sd
A|and, and maybe this is too general,|h
A|but I just believe that, um, they do not look at democracy the same way we do.|sv
A|They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, so, you know, trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just, you know,|sv
A|I don't think that that's the way to go in this|sv
A|and, um, you know, it, it. Oh, well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I guess, you know, I'd like you to maybe express something here.|ad
B|Well I, I, I think overall that's right.|aap_am
B|I think it's kind of sad though, that, for generations they've been taught to hate each other.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And that's, you know,|%
B|if,|%
B|somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way.|sv
A|That's,|%
A|yeah.|b
B|You know, an, an, I, I think that, um,|sv
B|true we do have completely different ways of looking at things, at a lot of things,|sv
B|but, uh, at the same time, I think there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do, as far as example|sv
B|and, and, uh, I think some different things could come from what's happened, than what we expect.|sv
A|Well,|%
A|well, yeah,|b
A|um, I, I guess we could be a catalyst for their change.|sv
A|I, um,|%
A|the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there|sv
A|and I don't think we'd be talking about this, you know, the Israeli situation, Palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a war.|sv
A|I mean that was one thing, that came out of it, good or bad,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I don't judge any war as good or bad,|sd
A|it's just a war.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I don't see any winners or losers,|sv
A|I just see dead bodies.|sv
A|I'm sorry. You know,|sv
A|but, um, I, I just think, you know, you're right|sv
A|and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along.|sv
A|It's not going to be that we're going to, uh, you know, sort of, tell them to go to their room|sv
A|and that's going to solve the whole problem.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's going to be them,|sv
B|But, that's the type of thing they understand.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|They don't understand any other way.|sv
A|And, you know,|%
B|And so at that, at that, you have to work at their level, to an extent, too.|sv
A|It's,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that, that's true too,|sv
A|I, um.|%
B|They wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war.|sv
A|Oh, well yeah,|b
A|they, they understand violence.|sv
B|There was nothing else.|sv
B|Yeah.|%
A|They love violent leaders, to, you know,|sv
A|I mean look at, you know, the leader they had.|ad
A|They, they just adored him, because he was so strict and cruel,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, you know, for a while there he had them,|sd
B|I can't figure out why they adored him.|sd
A|Well it has a lot to do with their religion.|sv
A|I got to say, that over there, um,|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this,|sd
A|because I, I've, you know, traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that|sd
A|and one, one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life, um, is from that area of the country|sd
A|and I mean he is just overly, he, he is abounding in kindness, let's say.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And his wife is so godly, I mean, every thought,|sd
A|they have a totally different life than we have.|sv
B|Huh.|%
A|You know, and when you add the, um, commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they have very basic life, um,|sd
A|well it's just a very basic life|sd
A|and they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's, you know, everything is to the glory of Allah,|sv
A|and, and, you know, and, it, it's almost like,|sv
B|What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well that's, see using that,|%
A|yeah.|b
B|yes,|b
B|and they abuse that.|sv
A|And it's always been military|sd
A|and it's always been,|sd
A|and that's, that's always been the way of the world. Don't you think|qy
B|Which I think that that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|So it's really hard,  when you see the leaders, compared to the people.|sv
B|But I think in a, in a way the war,  uh, I think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing.|sv
B|And there are a lot of people who are good people.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|You know, there's,|%
B|and I, I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and, trying to get out of that situation.|sv
A|Right|aa
A|and surrendering,|sd
A|that was,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, and, the, you know,|%
A|it just really comes down to people are people, you know,|sv
A|you have to have some compassion some humanness.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Doesn't matter where the boundaries are. Um, you know,|sv
A|there are political boundaries|sd
A|and those are man made boundaries,|sd
A|but, you know, for heaven sakes, that's something that's been going on for ages,|sd
B|and I, I think so much of it is what you're taught.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|You know, they teach their children, uh, in such a way that,|sv
A|Well, hi.|fp
A|I guess, uh, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, uh, a gourmet club here. Um, which means that we have like eight, eight people, four couples.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And most of the husbands,|sd
A|this is really peculiar,|sv
A|most of the husbands cook.|sd
B|Great.|ba
A|I mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day.|sv
A|Um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,|sd
A|but it was the guys that got together and did all this.|sd
B|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|And, um, like my husband just, he really, really likes to cook in terms of, um, oh, barbecue,|sd
A|and I mean all guys, I think, like to barbecue.|sv
A|I think it's caveman,|sv
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|I'm telling you,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|but, um, he really does cook|sd
A|and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't, you can't knock that.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|But all these other guys do too,|sd
A|and so we've gotten together|sd
A|and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.|sd
A|And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do.|sv
A|You,|%
B|How often do you meet?|qw
A|Well, we try,|%
A|I mean, because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that.|^h
A|It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well|sd
B|Oh, yes,|b
B|yes.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids. Um,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|then we would, we tried to do it every other month,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but lately it's just been once every six months|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Well, that's much more reasonable.|sv
B|I was involved in a, a club like that for, um, that, you know, where we tried to really do gourmet, uh, meals.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, we, we were a little bit too frequent I think.|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|I don't remember if we were once a month|sd
B|or anyway it was, it was difficult.|sv
B|By the time we went around it was, uh, four couples|sd
B|so, uh, by the time we got around, uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost tired, you know. Um, partly because, um, gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining.|sd
A|Really,|b
A|really|b
B|It's too rich.|sv
A|Oh, it is absolutely.|aa
B|And, so, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|Um, so, uh, we, we kind of,|%
B|and then one of the couples, uh, moved|sd
B|and so we sort of didn't, didn't continue it,|sd
B|but, um, and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as much time for, uh, regular entertaining,|sd
B|but, um, uh, uh, when, when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, um, kind of good for everybody|sd
B|and that's, that sometimes means you can't do gourmet, because depending on who your guests are.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Well, yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|sv
A|And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish|sd
A|so I mean he can get within,|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
B|Uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh, well, I take that back.|sd
B|Uh, she can't eat some cream cheese.|sd
B|But that, that really limits,|sv
A|It sure|aa
B|um,|%
A|it makes you, uh, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out, for something like,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Right.|b^m
A|So we, we try to keep all that in mind,|sd
A|but otherwise, um, I guess, you know, entertaining, um,|%
A|I, I guess I have recipes|sd
A|I, um,|%
A|but that's, that's basically what we do is the gourmet,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, but it's fun.|sv
A|I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|and, you know, you get all prepared|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but you're right.|sv
A|It's very, very rich|sv
A|and I'm glad we don't have it every,|sd
A|because it is, it's a, quite a treat|sv
A|it really is.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um,|%
B|Sounds wonderful.|ba
A|Right,|b
A|but so, you like food|qy^d
A|and I just love the, the community of food.|sd
A|I just, think it's neat.|sv
B|Oh, sure I do too.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just love sharing meals and, and whatever you can do, you know, to do that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I don't think you have to be, you know, more than hamburgers and hot dogs out, in the backyard and the, and the coleslaw and potato salad.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|But, but,|%
B|Sure.|b
B|Well, my, um, daughter is graduating, uh, Sunday|sd
B|and so we're having, a, uh, few people in Sunday afternoon.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And I did a cop out on to it|sd
B|I'm buying cold cuts|sd
B|Well, I have to, make a cake|sd
A|What are you providing ?|qw
B|and I have to make hors d'oeuvres|sd
B|and I have to make dessert|sd
B|so, I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|There you go.|ba
B|Uh, so, oh, I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on.|sd
B|But I can't do it, you know, working full-time|sd
B|and, it's just too much.|sv
A|I know.|ba
A|We're all not built like, uh, what, what, oh, Martha Stewart, you know.|sd
B|Those people that try to do everything.|^2
B|Yeah|b
A|We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and, and time to, you know,|sd
B|Ugh|ba
B|Wouldn't that be nice?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|Shot a video of the whole thing,|sd
A|I don't know .|h
B|Yeah,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|But it's, it's really kind of a neat thing.|sv
A|I get a kick out of it.|sd
A|I, I really do.|sd
A|Everything, all parts of the food,|sd
A|I mean I love to make things from scratch, you know. Making breads|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and you know people really pretty much appreciate it.|sv
B|Oh, they do.|ba
B|it's very difficult to purchase, um, items that are as good as what you can make yourself.|sv
A|Oh, I think so.|aa
B|Um, in spite of, uh,|%
B|or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.|sv
B|In fact, uh, I just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts|sd
B|and I, I bought turkey and pastrami and, and barbecued ham at a, an Amish market near here.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And I've never been there before. And found that there's, uh, individual vendors|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and the foods are wonderful.|sd
B|And one of the, uh, the, um, vendors had cakes. All sorts of wonderful cakes. Uh, they, fresh strawberry cheesecake now and, and so on.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. Um, which is really not such a bad price.|sd
B|I decided I, I just couldn't quite make myself, um, buy it because I do make cheesecake|sd
B|and somehow I didn't want to do that because it,|sd
A|There you go.|ba
B|but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful,|sd
B|and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|That but those are homemade.|sd
B|They are not, um, commercial bakery made.|sd
B|And in that they are made in their homes, um,|sd
B|so it, it's kind of interesting, uh,|sv
B|it's out there if you want to pay the price|sd
B|but,|%
A|Oh, it is.|aa

A|The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.|sd
A|I've, uh,  uh,  become available to come and go more often,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I said "hey, it's worth it,|sd
A|I'll just go at the matinee hour|^q
A|and I can see what I please."|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's no more costly than renting one.|sd
A|The last,|%

B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, and he was|%

B|COCOON?|qy^d
A|COCOON,|sd
A|uh-huh.|ny
B|Okay.|b
A|He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|I don't, I don't know what his name is.|sd
B|Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND.|sd
A|That was with Richard Dreyfuss.|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|And, that one was just a very poignant story,|sv
A|it, it, it had people,|sd
A|it was, it was you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,|sd
A|but it was,  a  very, it was a poignant humor|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there was, it was like, uh, uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS.|sv
A|The characters played very well off one another.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And there was humor involved,|sd
A|but the story was a very dramatic story,|sv
A|and I enjoyed it very much.|sd
A|What are some others that you have seen lately?|qw
B|Oh, I'm trying to think, uh,|^h
B|just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,  again|sd
A|Oh, whoa,|ba
A|yes.|b
B|and that's  one that,|%
A|That's one I can watch,  over  and over and over again.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I was going to read while it was on,|sd
B|but then when it started, I just couldn't, you know, read.|sd
B|That was a really good movie.|sv
A|It sure was.|aa
A|And, you know, the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.|sv
A|There are a number of good movies like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|there's quite a few, uh, movies out now that I would like to go see.|sd
B|My husband,  is  not a real big movie goer,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Plus, by the time you get a baby-sitter, and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|You don't work?|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|I stay at home.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day.|ad
B|Yeah.|b
B|Go during the day,|bf
B|that's right.|aa
A|That's right.|sd
A|There's nothing wrong with that.|sv
A|Go in the early hours,|ad
A|it's a matinee,|sd
A|it's not crowded|sd
A|and the price is as reasonable as renting a video.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's the way I do it|sd
A|and I go quite frequently.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|If you are going to be planning on doing that,|sd
A|now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that is, you know, magically shot into the present time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded,|sd
A|there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.|sd
A|But,  uh,  the action was comfortable|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.|sd
A|So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore.|sd
A|And there were some others,|sd
A|but they were done a little more tastefully.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet|sd
B|Uh.|b
A|and I could not handle that.|sd
A|I said "whoa, I'm glad I have not had dinner".|sd
A|Then, uh, I saw AWAKENING,|sd
A|that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.|sv
A|I, uh, I, uh,|%
B|Robert De Niro?|br
A|Robert De Niro,|sd
A|what did I say, Peter?|qw
B|I think you said Peter.|sd
A|I said Robert De Niro.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, uh, disabled person.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing.|sv
A|Even when he's sad, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.|sd
A|I guess, I can wait another month|sd
A|and they will be videos.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.|sd
A|I've heard a lot about that one.|sd
A|They say if you really want to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see.|sd
A|And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television. Uh.|sd
B|Well, you know, I think I read about that too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then THELMA AND LOUISE,|sd
A|I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.|sv
A|It's about time for one of those.|sv
A|I want to go see that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES.|sd
B|Oh, you haven't,|qy^d
B|I've heard that is wonderful.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|I've heard it's wonderful too,|sd
A|but I, it's just that they are both very long uh, movies,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and the matinee starts before I can get away from work.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've heard that's,|sd
B|we, uh, we, uh, rented the other one,|sd
B|I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, uh, Harrison Ford,|sd
B|I guess he's in there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I thought that was really good.|sv
A|You know, I saw that|sd
A|and I really I cannot remember too much about it.|sd
B|It was the one where he was a defense,|sd
B|uh, not defense,|ar
B|he was a|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A office.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then he ended up being accused of it.|sd
A|Oh, that's right,|aa
A|I remember now.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I remember.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies.|sd
A|I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones.|sv
A|I realize that he would like his career to develop,|sd
A|but I don't want to see him in other things.|sd
A|But, uh, I tell you, Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,|sd
A|I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies.|sd
A|I don't know|h
A|he was too .|%
B|I was never into those movies, either.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|I didn't care for the type of movie,|sd
A|but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed|sv
A|and I didn't like him.|sd
A|But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I thought he looked real good with a beard, too.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|he does|sv
A|and there is just a, there's a,|%
A|I don't know, uh,|h
A|I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time.|sv
A|And, I enjoy those,|sd
A|and I enjoy some of the Michael J. Fox movies.|sd
A|I didn't care too much for the last one either.|sd
A|It just was not enough to it.|sv
B|What was the last one?|qw
B|I'm trying to think.|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|Uh, the last,|%
B|like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one .|sd

A|Hi.|fp
B|Uh, books,|sd
B|I've, actually I am reading a couple of different books, uh,|sd
B|one is, uh, a story,|sd

B|it is a collection of, uh, of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes, uh,|sd
A|Oh.|%
B|that was, uh, that was,|%
B|it came out a couple of years ago|sd

B|I have had it a couple years,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
A|Who wrote that?|qw
B|Oh, I do not remember the man's name,|sd
B|he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two,|sd
B|and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell,|sd
B|and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|They, on|%
B|I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles,|sd
B|they used to have a,|sd
B|or, I guess they still do, uh,|sv
B|had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices|sd
B|and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected,|sd
B|he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything,|sd
B|he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away|sd
B|and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for|sd
B|he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, And had ended up,|sd
A|I see.|b
B|he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect,|sd
B|and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from Hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main assistant back, uh, in the fifties and well, I guess, in the sixties, up until his death.|sd
A|Well, that is interesting.|ba
A|Right.|b
B|So, it's pretty interesting work|sv
B|so,|%
A|That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard|sv
B|you have to plod through it|sv
B|and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.|sd
A|And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|I have not seen it.|sd
B|But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh,|sd
B|it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have.|sd
B|I am sort of rereading it.|sd
B|It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle,|sd
B|but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian,|sd
B|he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know,|sd
B|he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,|sd
A|Uh.|%
A|Explained , *listen; could be br|sd
B|and, you know. Uh, and the reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen.|sd
B|And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all|sd
B|but it's, uh,|%
B|Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two,|sd
B|and they were, they were lost|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|they were.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so, and in the book, you know, even,|sd
B|he wrote this book back in the seventies,|sd
B|and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water.|sd
B|And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth.|sd
B|And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?|qy
B|Uh, no,|nn
B|I have not.|sd
A|I, I think that would be,|sv
A|I am sure there is something out there, uh,  ,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I would  I would like to, too,|sd
B|because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of of where she  ,|sd
A|I thought she  was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.|sd
B|Uh|%
A|Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course, you know, it is so weird,|sv
A|cause no one will ever really know,|sv
A|it's, it,|%
A|so but it's entertaining|sv
A|and it makes you think about things.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That is for sure.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|So, that is pretty much for right now,|sd
B|that is, what I have been reading.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I kind of like to read different stuff|sd
B|and, uh, I like to read a novel every now and then,|sd
B|but, uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, I, I guess I just have not read|sd
A|I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's|sd
A|and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|And I just really, really liked the way he writes.|sd
A|It's just, incredible.|sv

B|My, uh, you know,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book,|sd

B|and then about,|%
B|that is when it really got big.|sd
B|And, uh, so I,|%
A|That was good, I think.|sv
A|And, and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year|sd
A|and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, uh,|sd
B|OF THE VANITY ,|^2
A|BON|%
A|yeah.|aa
B|I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.|sd
A|Uh.|%
A|Yeah|b
A|I,|%
A|that was really, really good,|sv
A|the movie was nothing compared to the book.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that is what I have heard.|sd
A|And.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|I saw the movie,|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Oh, the movie was a joke compared to,|sv
A|I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
A|and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie|sv
B|Right.|b
B|I know.|b
A|And, anyway, we are not talking about that,|sd
A|but, uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden|sd
A|and, uh, And, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that|sd

A|you know I have a list too|sd
A|and I have never gotten to it|sd
B|Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list,|sd
B|cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know,|sd
B|I have book shelves|sd
B|and I have them all out|sd
B|and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh,|sd
B|I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is|sd
B|the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book|sd

B|Recently,|sd
B|my most recent trip was last year,|sd
B|and that was Detroit.|sd
A|Detroit?|br
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?|qy
B|Well, it wasn't really.|ng
B|It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.|sd
A|Right,|bk
A|okay.|bk
B|And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?|qy^d
B|No.|nn
B|The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.|sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|And that was real nice. Uh,|sv
A|Did you scuba dive there?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.|sd
A|Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.|sd
A|Oh, that would be enjoyable.|ba
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|that's, a nice break.|ba
B|Huh.|b
A|I haven't been on vacation in a while either.|sd
A|Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
B|Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.|ba
A|So it's a lot of fun.|sd
A|I worked up there last summer,|sd
A|so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long|sd
B|Oh, well, that's nice.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Worked at a camp there,|sd
A|and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.|sd
A|So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.|sd
B|Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,|sd
B|and that's canoeing.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,|sd
B|and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,|sd
B|and they've really enjoyed it.|sd
A|That's nice.|ba
A|We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.|sd
B|It's a whole new,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|It's really, really pretty.|sv
A|I was a little kid then,|sd
A|and we to have, uh,|%
A|we stayed at some park|sd
A|and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,|sd
A|and he would give a little talk about mountain things.|sd
A|You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,|sd
A|but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,|sd
B|Sure.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we would have to, we'd|sd
A|and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found|sd
A|and, That's a good family place to go,|sv
B|Oh, that's neat.|ba
B|Sure.|b
A|and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,|sv
A|but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was like,|sv
B|Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,|sv
B|and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And you're more receptive.|sv
A|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Well, we, um, let's see,|^h
A|the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then I went to England a few years ago.|sd
B|Oh, that's exciting.|ba
A|I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place|sd
A|and it's, there's not a language barrier|sd
A|so you don't,|%
A|I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,|sd
A|and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,|sv
A|but it's, it was really fun.|sv
A|I, I, I really enjoyed that.|sd
A|I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,|sd
B|but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,|sd
B|because she really has a great desire to do that,|sd
B|because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.|sd
A|It, it's really nice.|sv
A|I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city,|sd
A|because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are|sd
A|and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,|sd
A|but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,|sd
B|Do your own thing.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I had a great time doing that.|sd
A|It was really interesting.|sv
B|That's wonderful.|ba
B|There's a lot out there to see,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know,|ba
B|I'll say .|ba
A|I keep wanting to get up to,|sd

A|I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,|sd
B|Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So that was, that, that's a nice place.|sv
B|Canada is very nice.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|that would be nice.|sv
A|I had a friend from there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,|sd

B|Oh, yes,|aa
B|absolutely.|aa
B|Sure,|b
B|somebody that knows their way around.|bf
A|So, yeah,|aa
A|that's why, that's why England was nice.|sd
A|Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,|sd

A|most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,|sd
B|Well, you've been quite a few places there|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we have.|sd
A|We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.|sd
B|Once you think about it, huh.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,|sd
A|and you slept on the train at night.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|But there wasn't a,|%
A|it was strange,|sv
A|it was kind of sad,|sv
A|there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English|sd
A|and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's great.|ba
A|So we were kind of pitiful.|sd
A|We found one restaurant we were in and got seated,|sd
A|and then no one knew English in there,|sd
A|and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|But it was,|%
B|What did you wind up with?|qw
A|Oh, I had fondue.|sd
A|That was easy to say|sd
B|Oh, okay|bk
A|Tried to get fondue and white wine,|sd
A|and that was,|%
B|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.|sd
A|There were some people at the next table who spoke English,|sd
A|so we elicited their aid for a while|sd

A|and, they were very helpful|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so, It was, it was a pleasant time.|sd
B|Well, good.|ba
A|I'd, I'd love to go back there.|sd
A|There's just not time|sd
A|There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.|sv
B|I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.|sv

B|I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death|sd
B|We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever.|sd
B|Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,|sd
B|we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April is when we went,|sd
A|Okay.|bk

A|Sure.|b
B|but,|%
A|Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?|qw
B|Oh, we take little nature hikes|sd
B|and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.|sd
B|Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and roast the marshmallows and what all.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
A|I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills|sd

A|my dad would take us,|sd
A|there was, there was four of us kids,|sd
A|we'd, he'd take us,|sd
A|and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,|sd
A|and it was always fun, uh,|sd
A|because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot|sd
A|and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,|sd
A|and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,|sd
A|and hopefully we'd catch our supper,|sd
A|but we never did|sd
B|Um.|%
A|but it was, it was always fun.|sd
A|We'd always,|sd
A|Mom was always prepared|sd
A|and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,|sd
A|so we always had, something along to eat,|sd
A|but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,|sd
A|and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.|sd
A|Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,|sd
A|I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,|sd
A|and, uh, there's no hills,|sd
A|it's flat,|sd
A|and then I was in high school,|sd
A|and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,|sd
A|but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,|sd
A|but, it, it was always fun.|sd
A|It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, in the hills we, we would do like you you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,|sd

B|Right.|b
B|Well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so. But,|%

A|our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me,|sd

B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Especially when you're in a hurry|sd

B|yeah.|ny
B|Usually in the week I'm .|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Some days it's real, real bad here,|sd

B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|But,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've traveled quiet a bit,|sd

B|It's pretty busy|sv
A|It really is,|aa
A|and pretty noisy.|sv
B|Yeah|b
A|It really is.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I live right on a main thoroughfare,|sd
A|so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy|sd
A|because it, at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night you know, when you go to bed.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And every time a, a fire truck or anything went down the road, I would wake up,|sd
A|but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|I suppose you do.|sv
A|And, uh, I just close it out, I guess, because I don't, I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I am a real solid sleeper though|sd
B|so that probably wouldn't bother me.|sv
B|I'd sleep right through it|sd
A|They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|It takes a lot.|sd
A|Let's see. What else is an invasion?|qw
B|I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I was mad because those were mine ,|sd
A|Well, did you have has name all over them?|qy
B|No|nn
B|It was a, a letter from a girlfriend of mine.|sd

A|Yeah.|%
B|Right.|aa

B|I was mad about that and my privacy there.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what do you think about, uh, the self insurance business?|qw
B|Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, uh, General, ex, uh, Surgeon General Koop.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he talked about Canada's system|sd
B|and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,|sv
B|but the expensive stuff, heart, uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.|sd
B|And they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in San Francisco.|sd
B|So in one city of, in America, there's as many, uh, hospitals that are equipped to do uh, heart operations as in the entire area of Canada,|sd
B|and that's kind of spooky.|sv
A|Well, I, uh, I understand what you're saying,|sd
A|and there's probably some truth to that.|sv
A|I think that, uh, generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities.|sv
A|However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession, it eventually leads to that,|sv
A|and I think the costs and the, uh, the way the medical profession has, every year|sd
A|I, being in my own business, uh,|sd
A|in the last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs,|sd
A|and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I think they're asking for it.|sv
A|I, I think the medical profession is just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|Do you  think that it's just, uh, medical guys?|qy
B|What about, you know, you know how expensive new equipment and technology is.|qw
B|That's where I think most of the cost is coming.|sv
A|Well, I, I think a lot of it is, uh,|sv
A|I, I don't disagree totally with that,|arp_nd
A|but, uh, my wife this last summer, uh, when we were on vacation tore up her knee,|sd
A|and, uh, uh, it was ligaments, uh, in her  knee,  as it turned out, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|she came back that, uh,|sd
A|we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened|sd
A|and, uh, she got home,|sd
A|and the leading orthopedic man, who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come,|sd
A|I mean, he knows knee problems  okay,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it.|sd
A|Well, she goes in,|sd
A|he says, well, I think this is what it is,|sd
A|but, uh, you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things.|^q
A|A thousand dollars for this, uh, oh, magnetic, uh, resonance imaging type thing.|sd
A|And my wife said, well, do I need that?|sd
A|And he says, well, uh, you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this.|sd
A|I mean, uh, you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing.|^q
A|Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital.|sd
A|Now, a,  thousand, uh, uh, dollars for thirty-five minutes.|sd
B|Oh, great.|ba
A|I mean, doctors routinely send people in for anything.|sv
A|Now, for years they didn't have this|sd
A|and they solved these problems,|sv
A|and, you  know,|%
B|Yeah .|b
A|I said to her, well, look, you know, if you feel you got to go, go,|sd
A|but I, I think a thousand dollars,|sd
A|these guys,|%
A|I don't know what it is,|sd
A|but  there's,  no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day.|sv
B|Uh-huh .|b
A|And even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at, uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, uh, that's ridiculous.|sv
A|I, I don't care what anyone says.|sd
A|You know, the costs are not,|sv
A|it's a picture.|sd
A|It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that, you know, reasonableness.|sv
A|But they aren't reasonable.|sv
A|Fifty, a hundred dollars.|sd
A|They don't have to pay them back in three months time.|sd
B|No.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I'll have to  agree,  with you there,|sd
A|You know .|%
B|but there's another problem,|sv
B|and that's the, how litigious our society is.|sv
B|If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court.|sv
A|Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem,|sv
A|but that's part of our legalese problem.|sv
A|And that, the government eventually will address too just, you know, because it's out of control.|sv
A|I, I agree with you.|aa
A|You know, uh, I was on a jury|sd
A|or I, I didn't make the jury,|sd
A|but there was a, deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Like it was three days after it was born,|sd
A|and he was the one that delivered it.|sd
A|And they got four attorneys,|sd
A|one guy out of Houston, he introduced himself as snake so-and-so,|sd
A|and he says, well, anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars,|sd
A|and I says, yeah,|sd
A|I got problems with|^q
A|I mean, you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back, you know,|sd
A|I mean, as sorrowful as it is. Uh, you know, if the doctor is wrong, you know, he should be pulled from his license,|sv
A|but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, you know,|sd
A|it, it doesn't make logical sense to me,|sd

A|Uh, that's,|%
B|You think about AIDS research?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Um, well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,|sd

A|Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?|qy
B|Um, well, not, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,|ng

A|Yeah,|b
A|it sounds awful.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's, it's a very nasty thing.|sd
A|Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly|qy
A|and,|%
B|Um, yeah,|ny
B|that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,|sd
B|and the white blood cell count goes down,|sd
B|which is, that's AIDS Related Complex,|sd
B|but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS|sd

A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|tell me about the car that you've got.|ad
B|Well, I have a Honda, um, hatchback, nineteen eighty-four.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, I'll be honest with you.|sd
B|I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, uh, put together|sd
B|and it, it does its job.|sv
B|All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles,|sd
B|and I, I did have to put two, two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles,|sd
B|but that car just purrs like the day it was built.|sd
B|I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town.|sd
B|It's a five speed straight stick machine.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I can carry more in that, uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars,|sd
B|and I have a large, um, Pontiac,|sd
B|and I have a sixty-nine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old,|sd
B|but it's in beautiful shape.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other bigger cars.|sd
A|Well, that's very interesting.|ba
A|I've had, I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got.|sd
A|It's a,|%

B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yours is a four door.|qy^d
A|Four door,|na
A|yeah|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and very, very comfortable car.|sv
A|Big roomy trunk|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|uh, and, uh, and very happy with it,|sd
A|and I must admit it's, you know,|sd
A|if, if, if, uh,|%
A|my only consideration were, were, you know, buying another car just to tool around town in and make, you know, brief trips and things like that,|sd
A|I would very, very seriously consider buying one. Uh,|sd
A|I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|they are.|sv
A|Um, my, my real concern with, uh, uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, um, trip down the road about once a month, because I'm divorced|sd
A|and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina|sd
B|Um, uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, I drive, down Interstate Ninety-five,|sd
A|and it's just an absolutely wild highway.|sv
B|Ninety-five is wild in any car.|sv
B|There's no doubt about that|aa
A|Yeah|b
A|and,|%
B|because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to,|sd
B|I'm retiring the end of this month|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.|sd
A|And, you, well, you've got it,|aa
A|and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, that, uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past,|sd
A|and uh, I've, I've,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service,|sv
A|but, uh, I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.|sd
A|Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,|sd
A|and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, need to be taken care of, and so forth.|sd
A|And I guess that's one thing that, that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood,|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|Yes,|aa
B|it just, just sits there and purrs,|sd
B|and you, all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.|sd
B|I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.|sd
A|Oh, I know.|aa
A|It's really amazing.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It's, uh,|sv
B|Beautiful, beautiful machine.|^2
A|Absolutely,|aa
A|incredible|ba
A|So, um, yeah,|%
A|anyway, I've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,|sd
A|and I think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about, the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own|sv
B|Is that right,|bh
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, um,|%
B|Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?|qy^d
A|Well, certainly some of the top end ones.|na
A|You can still get, get, uh, even the, the low end wagons, um, for less than twenty thousand dollars|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we get, you know,|sd
A|in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here|sd
B|Um, uh-huh.|b
A|so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any week,|sd
A|and I sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth|sd
A|and so, um, anyway, and that's, that's the other thing is that I've, I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life,|sd
A|and I've tended to, um, to, uh, buy cars that are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.|sd
A|This Honda that I have I bought used,|sd
A|and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.|sd
A|I've just rolled seventy thousand miles,|sd
A|and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.|sd
A|So|%
B|Well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it|sd

B|Well, it was around here last night,|na
B|I'll tell you that|sd
A|Well, actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, uh, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, uh, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirty-two.|sd
B|No kidding.|bh

B|Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.|ng
B|This is, uh, this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in.|sd
B|This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime.|sd
A|Oh, I guess so,|sv
A|yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|b^m
B|the, the air systems are reasonably calm.|sd
B|We don't have, uh, the turbulence have a, uh, little bit of chop,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's not like it is in the spring time.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|aa
A|Well, we moved actually down here from another location,|sd

B|Spectacular is the right word for them.|aa
A|Pardon me?|br
B|Spectacular is a good word for them|aa
A|I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas.|sd

A|actually I've, I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky,|sd

A|It's, it's fabulous.|sv

B|Oh.|b
A|and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and, and sleigh riding and everything else.|sd

B|usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and February,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they're up over sixty-five or|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|should begin. *listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay.|aa
B|All right.|aa
A|Uh, I can begin this, um,|sd
A|basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the, the benefit program we have here is really quite good.|sv
A|I'm, I'm pretty pleased with it.|sd
A|They cover, uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, you name it,|ad
A|and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much,|sd
A|so I'm pretty satisfied myself.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, what's your situation?|qw
B|I work for the University of New Hampshire,|sd
B|and uh, our benefits package isn't, uh, isn't quite as good in some ways. Uh, you know,|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|overall I'm satisfied with it.|sd
B|We don't have the vision care,|sd
B|we do have the health care and the, uh, and the or the dental.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|Are you a professor there?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I work in, I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,|sd
B|and I, effectively I run the telephone switch at, uh, at the University of New Hampshire.|sd
A|Oh, I see,|bk
A|okay.|bk
B|Uh, so the, uh, the benefits,|sd
B|uh, probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.|sd
A|Oh, no doubt|aa
B|We get fifteen days a year sick time,|sd
B|and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, that's good.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is, uh,|sd
A|I used to work with the Army Research Institute,|sd
A|and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But here you don't get that.|sd
A|You maybe get two or three a year.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it's really,|%
A|unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, that's, that's kind of a drawback I think.|sv
A|But, uh. I don't know.|h
A|What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of, of the different benefits?|qw
B|Well, I think, uh, the, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, uh you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'm, I'm a little disturbed about that,|sd
B|but I think that's a national trend,|sv
B|and I don't know that, uh, I don't know what the solution is to it.|sd
B|It's bigger than just the benefits part.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night,|sd
A|they, uh, they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward, uh, nationalizing health care and that kind of thing.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|It's kind of an interesting plan.|sv
A|It's kind of cold though.|sv
A|They've essentially made up a list of, uh, oh, all the different, uh, medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff,|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by, by, uh, subsidized health care,|sd
A|and the ones above would.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|So it's kind of like drawing this line|sd
A|and, and if you have it great,|sd
A|if you don't, you're kind of out of luck|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, um, it was kind of an interesting show.|sv
B|Um.|%
A|I think you're right,|sd
A|I think health care is probably the, the most pressing uh, the pressing one,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but I'll tell you, I, I don't mind having dental, you know,|sd
A|sometimes dental costs can be, um, just about as expensive, if not more,|sv
A|and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I'm not sure that's, that's widely followed any more.|sv
A|I'm not sure,|sd
A|how, how does, uh, University of New Hampshire handle it?|qw
B|Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, uh, depending,|sd
B|and, and the cost between them is very, is very little.|sd
B|I think it costs me something like five dollars a, a month for the dental plan.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|But it pays, uh, a substantial amount.|sd
B|I mean, the examinations and, and, uh, checkups every year, or every six months are free|sd
A|Great.|ba
B|and, uh, it, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.|sd
A|Is that, uh, let me interrupt, is that the same for both, uh, professors and, and also staff and administration,|qy
A|is that generally across the board, do you think|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, yes,|ny
B|it is.|sd
B|The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff, which I belong to|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but the main,|%
B|I think the, the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.|sv
B|But the main difference is in the, uh, the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Uh, for the operating staff it's on a seniority, it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|That determines how much, uh, vacation time they get.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I'm kind of interested because I'm actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to, uh, is to teach in a university.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|but, uh,|%
A|yeah,|b
A|that's, that's interesting.|sv
A|That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would, uh, they would cover and things like that.|sd
B|College programs belong to this T I A A, uh, C R E F retirement fund.|sd
A|Oh, is that right?|bh
B|Right,|na

B|I, you know,  I'm not  for it.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|if there's  if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know that|sd
A|they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they actually, uh,|sd
A|I know it's this way in Florida.|sd
A|They have a waiting period where you buy one|sd
A|and that's a week|sd

B|Sure.|b
A|You know, you might do the same thing.|sv

B|Wonderful touch tone telephone there.|sv
A|Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?|qw
B|Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies,|^h
B|therefore, my, my reading pleasures are quite wide.|sd
B|Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS HIGHWAY, which is, uh, very colorful, and, uh, not being a native of Texas, but being here eleven years have a tendency to, uh, find out the, uh, about the different areas of the of the, of the state by reading it.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Right,|b
A|I've read that one too.|sd
A|I only had a subscription once,|sd
A|but my mother always gave me hers|sd
A|and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.|sd
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.|sv
B|It's pretty, pretty neat.|sv
B|Um, oh, I like photography, um, magazines.|sd
B|I don't take a subscription or anything like that.|sd
B|Um, things, oh,|%
B|being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines|sd
B|and, and, uh, kind of strange because I, it's not unusual to, uh, see, uh, an engineering manual or something laying around the house|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it,|sd
B|but, uh.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|How about yourself?|qo
A|Well, um, I have an interest in art,|sd
A|so I, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.|sd
A|Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's fairly interesting.|sv
B|I bet that would be, rather interesting.|aa
B|Uh, that's, uh, self improvement,|sv
B|that's, that's well, that's kind of a hobby|sv
B|but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.|sd
A|How about you?|qo
B|Um, well I hate to,|h
B|yes,|ny
B|I do|sd
B|We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes|sd
B|and, and they give you books|sd
B|and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht .|sd
B|It talks about, uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is|sv
B|and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.|sd
B|You're my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type. Which all, you know, betters yourself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean they are|sv
A|but I don't label it as such.|sd
B|Like what for example.|qw^d
A|Well, I don't know, um,|h
A|I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,|sd
A|but, uh, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know getting your, yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do. Convincing you that you need to get on with it.|sd
B|Sure.|b
B|Sure.|b
B|How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big,|qy
B|okay.|%
A|Yes.|aa
B|So those are self improvements.|sv
A|Sure.|aa
B|Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW. By a man, man named Doctor Bittel, B I T T E L it|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.|sd
B|And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers|sd
B|So it's, it's it's interesting,|sv
B|here again it's, it's casual reading|sv
B|and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff|sd
B|and it's really excellent fast reading|sv
B|and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, you know,|sv
B|I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.|sd
A|I don't know,|ar
A|I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King.|sv
A|That's a little, little heavy for me.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting|sv
B|and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,|sv
B|but, uh, it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I have a hard time finishing books.|sd
A|Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways .|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other|sv
A|but, uh, I think sometimes the word is a little over used|sv
B|Exactly, exactly right.|aa
A|but,|%
B|Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.|sv
B|I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk|sv
B|and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.|sv
A|Okay,|b
A|well, any other comments.|qy
B|Uh, not that I can think of.|ng
B|Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit.|sv
B|I need to probably make a phone call or two|sd
A|Well we just started,|sd
A|right.|%
B|Uh, this is true.|aa
B|I've enjoyed it.|fc
A|Well you too,|fc
A|and uh, good-bye.|fc
B|Have a good day.|fc
A|Good-bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye|fc
A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I don't know about you|sd
A|but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work|sd
A|and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next|sd
A|It's pretty bad,|sv
A|but it's true, you know, in|sv
A|they tend to try to be, you know, real lax|sd
A|and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people|sd
A|and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know.|sd
A|We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want.|sd
A|And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.|sd
B|Well, I'm kind of that way too.|sd
B|I work in the legal department|sd
B|and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,|sd
B|it always seems like I'm doing that|sv
B|and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around,|sv
B|so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down.|sd
B|But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up.|sd
B|Yeah,|%
B|and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you know, we're kind of that way too.|sd
A|I try to,|sd
A|I'm the same way you are,|sv
A|I kind of try to judge from day to day.|sd
A|I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers|sd
A|and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time|sd
A|and, and, you know, if I know that they're going to be there, you know, you, I try to really watch it and like you say, you know, really dress up|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and if I know they're not, you know,|sd
A|I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|It is|sv
A|and so,|%
B|As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story|sd
B|when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes.|sd
B|We had them in the warehouse,|sd
A|Uh.|%
B|and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road|sd
B|and it wasn't air conditioned,|sd
B|and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer,|sd
B|it's unair-conditioned,|sd
B|it was dusty and dirty, uh,|sd
B|there was like a fan at the very end of the row|sd
B|and that was it.|sd
B|And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to,|sd
B|we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we wore shorts.|sd
B|We didn't know that was a big no, no.|sd
A|Oh no.|ba
B|And the supervisor from another area came up to us|sd
B|and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there,|sd
B|and he, he knew who worked there,|sd
B|he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there.|sd
B|And he came up to us|sd
B|and he just said, who's your supervisor.|sd
B|Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor,|sd
B|and it went up all the way to the head of facilities, complaining that we were wearing shorts.|sd
A|Oh no in|ba
B|He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.|sd
B|That could have alleviated a big problem.|sv
B|We ended up getting called out on it.|sd
A|Oh, how awful.|ba
A|It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I don't care,|sd
A|you can call them split skirts|sd
A|and you can call them culottes all you want|sd
A|but these were shorts.|sv
A|That's all they were.|sd
A|I don't care what else you call them, you know,|sd
A|if they're below the knee, okay,|sv
A|maybe you can call them split skirts.|sv
A|If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know.|sv
A|And these weren't even really full ones.|sd
A|I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know,|sd
A|and these weren't even those.|sd
A|These were like pretty short, black,|sd
A|and they were very dressy,|sd
A|the were black velvet shorts|sd
A|and she had on black hose and black heels|sd
A|and she looked very, very nice.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|But, you don't wear shorts to work.|sv
A|You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation|sv
A|and nobody says anything to them.|sd
A|It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|You know, if they just, you know,|%
A|the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no,|sv
A|this is wear we're going to draw the line.|^q
A|This is shorts, you know.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,|sd
B|Um.|%
A|so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too.|sv
A|It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,|^q
A|but.|%
B|Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they have said no|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|and then during the week you see these women, in the you know,|sd
A|just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,|sd
A|I mean they always have hose on,|sd
A|but still, it's, they're shorts,|sd
A|I don't care what you say,|sd
A|they're shorts.|sd
A|Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.|sv
B|I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,|sd
B|I had a friend,|sd
A|Oh do they really?|qy
B|Oh definitely.|na
B|I had a friend who worked there for a year or so|sd
B|and they spell it out.|sd
B|For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes.|sd
A|Oh, my God.|ba
B|Oh, it is definitely lined out.|sd
B|Women are not allowed to wear slacks,|sd
B|you wear coordinated suits.|sd
A|I I couldn't afford to work there.|sd
B|And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,|sd
B|oh it is spelled out.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it told about the dress code|sd
B|and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.|sd
A|T I says no shorts and no halters|sd
A|I know, that's it.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.|sd
A|I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.|sv
A|I mean, I see,|%
A|I, I am more,|sd
A|I don't know about anybody else,|sd
A|and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,|sd
A|but I am more productive when I'm in pants.|sv
A|I, I am.|sv
A|I work faster,|sv
A|I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know,|sv
A|I,|%
A|and it's weird|sv
A|but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.|sv
B|Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.|sd
B|And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse|sd
B|but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.|sd
B|We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know,|^q
B|you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.|^q
B|And she And she was so, she was so hot and miserable, you know, in the skirt.|sd
A|You can't do that in a skirt poor soul.|bf
A|Oh yuck.|ba
B|She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants|sd
B|but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's terrible,|ba
A|that's terrible|ba
A|gosh.|ba
A|Well I don't know,|h
A|I just figure, you know, yeah,|sd
A|sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants,|sd
A|and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know.|sd
A|But I'll go in in pants.|sd
A|I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.|sd
A|And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on,|sd
A|but, you know, I don't know if they do or not.|sd
A|You know, I see a lot of the managers|sd
A|and they're in jeans,|sd
A|so, you know.|%
B|Some of our people in the legal department,|sd
B|we have, um, assistants to the general counsel|sd
B|and it's funny|sv
B|because, there's one that always wears a suit.|sd
B|A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.|sd
A|Really, wow.|ba
B|And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish|sd
B|and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes|sd
B|and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.|sd
B|So that's just,|%
A|Isn't that funny.|bh
B|With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on|sd
B|so. We've, we've kind of had a variety there|sd
A|That's great.|ba
B|but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with,|sv
B|or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|If they're just going to be meeting with T I like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed|sd
B|and they're usually casual.|sd
A|That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|It really is, because your making, you know,|sv
A|if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know,|sv
A|or it would me, you know.|h
B|It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|look at this slick guy,|ad
A|I wonder what kind of money does he make,|sd
A|uh-huh|%
A|I can see it now.|sd
A|Well it was good to talk to you.|fc
A|It was really enjoyable.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|this is, this is kind of a fun project.|fc
A|It really is.|aa
B|I've done some of the other speech programs,|sd
B|but we've never got to talk to another person,|sd
B|it was always just talking to the computer.|sd
A|Oh, yuck,|ba
A|yeah.|b
B|So this is a little different.|sv
A|Well it's kind of enjoyable,|sv
A|I'm really looking forward to it.|sd

A|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|The question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service.|sd
B|I think it would be a great idea.|sv
B|I'm not sure about requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|but I think it would be a great idea.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of, you know, what they want to be or do|sv
B|or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time|sv
B|and we, sure, our country, all countries sure need help|sv
B|so,|%
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a local, uh,|qy
A|my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while, and, uh, in San Salvador, in El Salvador,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|For instance, everybody had what they called there social year, that they had to put in|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and most of them joined the Red Cross|sd
A|and it was done internally.|sd
A|I just,|%
A|there was very little external.|sd
A|I think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps, Type things where we're sending people off shore.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I think that would be real interesting for people to do,|sv
B|but, I guess, my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|and, but, I don't know.|h
B|If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really, you know, send children to do that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I didn't know.|sd
A|I don't, I don't know how the Peace Corps works,|sd
A|I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in, and all that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I was too.|sd
B|I thought seriously about joining at that time,|sd
B|I thought it was a fantastic idea.|sv
A|Did you ever get any information on it like,|qy
B|I sent off for stuff on it,|sd
B|but I don't remember that much. about it.|sd
B|I know that they trained you in the language|sd
B|and, um,|%
A|That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually,|sd
B|You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps,|sd
B|it wasn't much,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I guess, they, you could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and,|sv
A|Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I think so,|sv
B|yeah,|ny
B|yeah|ny
B|But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink|sv
A|Where they couldn't do that.|bf
A|Yeah,|%
A|you might end up with a revolution.|sv
A|I don't know which end though.|sv
B|Really|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way to do it,|sv
A|because from what I understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,|sv
B|Public hanging.|^2
A|yeah.|aa
A|Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know,|sd
A|so you don't have just a whole lot of, what we consider street crimes.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|I've heard that like in China and stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered, you know, on the, you know, street|sv
B|so,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, I guess, is a little, anyway,|sv
A|the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again|sd
A|I, I, I guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought, you know, Um, I, I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,|sv
A|but when you do that then it becomes almost, uh, a ,|sv
A|or it can be,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, there have,|%
A|people will kind of set up their own little club,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|sv
A|And, uh, but if, you know,|%
B|People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Might not go if it was voluntary,|sv
B|but I don't know how they'd enforce it,|sd
B|if it was,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|Shoot them.|ad
A|Put them in jail|ad
B|I don't know.|h
B|Send them over to Iraq|ad
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|Have a vacation in Iraq for a year|ad
A|I know my dad always talked about, uh,|sd
A|he was in C C C during, uh,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And he was, uh, a rock rib Iowa type republican|sd
A|and the only good thing he could ever say about, uh, the whole Roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|because he was in it.|sd
A|He thought that was great.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|The rest of it was all hog wash,|sd
A|but that was great.|sd
B|Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.|sv
B|It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled that way.|sv
B|I, I,|%
B|it would take quite a few people.|sv
B|I think it might build jobs for people, you know, that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,|sv
B|so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know.|h
A|Yeah|b
A|the only,|%
B|Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and|sd
A|Well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,|sv
A|what would you have, who, who, who would determine what these people do.|qw
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|You know, if, uh, you know, if it's run by the individual state.|sv
A|You know like C C C was run by the army|sd
A|and in effect,|%
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.|sv
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|And, uh, when the politics get real confusing,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that were really fair and you know, in a legal way or something,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|they could send all the people over to, uh, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported,|sv
B|or,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well,|%
A|We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, if, well, if the racial make up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know, That kind of thing.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That could be a complicated too, couldn't it.|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|b^m
A|Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction oriented|ad
A|and they went and they, they built, uh, can't think of a good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know,|sd
A|and one, you can, you can only build it in one place, you know,|sd
A|and know matter where you build it, somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|sv
B|Unfair or something,|bf
B|yeah.|%
A|Yeah.|ny
A|I think, uh,|%
A|oh, boy|ba
A|It's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great idea.|sv
A|It's like a joke I heard once about, uh, elephant foot soup, you know,|sd
A|it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.|sd
A|It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, gets you going.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Really.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, it seems like there's, there's a lot,|sv
B|you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting to do anything good or anything like that,|sv
B|but you know, I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing.|sv
B|I just, I saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting a,|sd
B|I guess now she's practically a teenager,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,|sd
B|and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas,|sd
B|there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a, um, minority, you know,|sd
B|I think it was in a Hispanic area,|sv
B|they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers, instead of, they said, all these gangs kids could join to belong.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so they were trying to start that out,|sd
B|so if there's people out there that are willing to, you know, kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy. Gosh, we ought to use them. You know. If their willing to do it.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's, it's , it's just the, you know,|%
A|here you are to the logistics of the thing again, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Who's going to run it, you know,|qh
A|what,|qh
A|how,|qh
A|oh, it's just so many|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Like, like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America.|sd
A|My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and they have situations like, like that down there. Where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|if you want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go to school in Cornell, Iowa, of all places,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and when they came back, they'd have to serve this, this year,|sd
A|and it turned out to be kind of a joke,|sd
A|the ones I knew, you know, always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural, and you know, Really good stuff,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very slim.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so,|%
B|Well, we, um, belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is like the Mormon church.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And, um, there, there is men and also women,|sd
B|women aren't nearly as frequent,|sd
B|and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left, that can volunteer to go on a mission|sd
B|and, um, they're all over the world.|sd
B|And, its incredible logistics,|sv
B|I mean, they have a training center where they teach them,|sd
B|it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah,|sd
B|and they have, to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then they, um, you know, go and actually live in that country for the, the, uh,|sd
B|young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Then that's, uh, kind of a private organization,|qy^d
B|Right.|na
A|you know, I'm, I'm familiar with,|sd
A|my instructor pilot was a Mormon,|sd
A|he was, he was a good construction, uh, you know, instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible,|sv
B|Oh, yeah|b
B|He had a direct connection somewhere, uh|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right|aa
A|He felt that he really had an in|sd
A|so, You know, things he would do with an airplane,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but any rate that's off the subject,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I,|%
B|They, they don't get paid for it,|sd
B|and, um, but there is funding that comes,|sd
B|they're supposedly saving up on their own|sd
B|and the church helps them out some,|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.|sv
A|I see how they were organized in, Central and South America|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, it's, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'll let you start first, okay?|qy
B|Okay.|na
B|We, um, I'm presently living in a house, uh,|sd
B|first time, uh,|sd
B|we had the house built|sd
B|and so this is our, our fifth year in it I guess,|sd
B|and, uh, um, it was a real excitement to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one made and built|sd
B|and like you wanted it, we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses.|sd
B|And, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home,|sd
B|and they're good for about five years or four years|sd
B|and after that they start falling apart.|sd
B|So, I would, uh, not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in, uh, because they're overpriced, uh,|sd
B|but they're a cheap house.|sd
B|If you can't afford something good, you know,|sd
B|they're good for that,|sv
B|and, um, you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head,|sd
B|but as far as the costs for what your getting, uh, the longevity of the house is not, uh, is not worth it.|sv
B|How about in your case?|qo
A|Well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter,|sd
A|but, in fact, he's in electronics,|sd
A|but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it.|sd
A|So it took him about two and a half years,|sd
A|but, uh, he built us a house,|sd
A|it's, uh,|%
A|we have thirty-two hundred square feet,|sd
A|and it's a brick house,|sd
A|and price-wise, it was great because he did it all himself, you know,|sd
A|so that way he could, we could kind of control, in, control it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, we live in kind of a small town,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I mean it's nothing fancy, you know,|sd
A|it's, it's a house,|sd
A|it's nice,|sv
A|and it's real pretty|sv
A|and we're all comfortable in it.|sd
B|Well, that's great,|ba
B|that's great,|ba
B|that's, uh,|%
B|I've heard,|sd
B|I have another gentleman, friend of mine, who, uh, who had a house built|sd
B|as a matter of fact another guy is building one now,|sd
B|he's been doing it for three years|sd
B|and the city's a little upset with him,|sd
B|but I understand you save a lot of money off, uh, by doing that,|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Oh, you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else.|sd
B|Nothing wrong with that,|sv
A|You know.|%
B|uh, I'll vouch for that.|sd
B|Um,|%
A|But, uh, of course, my husband did everything except|sd
A|my brother's a trim carpenter,|sd
A|and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us,|sd
A|and that helped.|sd
B|That was a big savings.|bf
A|And, uh,|%
A|yes,|aa
A|and, uh, we had to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else, nothing, you know,|sd
B|Well, that's great.|ba
B|uh, have you been in it long?|qy
B|Oh, really,|b
B|well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?|qy
A|no,|nn
A|we're,|%
A|well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now,|sd
A|and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,|sd
A|but he will not build a second one himself. Because he says age-wise he'll never be able to handle that again|sd
B|I see,|b
B|well,|%
B|First one is always a bear.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
B|We're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us|sd
B|and that can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any you know,|sd
B|so that's kind of, we just got with him and told him what all we wanted,|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it|sd
B|and he's certified, and registered|sd
B|so at least we know we're, it's not going to fall in or something if it's built.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh.|b
B|But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right,|sd
B|you can actually go out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things|sd
B|and, and that's kind of the plan I have|sd
B|so, I'm, uh,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|everyone I talk to, uh, I file in my little book and do other things with it .|sd
B|That's great,|^q
B|that's great.|^q
A|But, uh, like I said otherwise, you know, the expense,|sd
A|but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|I can imagine.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that,|sd
A|but, you know, it's ours.|sd
B|If your happy with it, that's all that counts.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
B|That's all,|sv
B|you only have to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.|sv
A|apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high|sv
B|Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell, I guess.|sv
A|Isn't it?|qy
A|It really is|sv
A|because I, I'm always shocked at about, you know, what they have it appraised at,|sd

B|I'm, I'm worried about them.|sd
B|They're in a very, uh, tumultuous state right now with the kinds of, uh, adaptations that they're attempting to go through, uh.|sv
A|I'm concerned about them not as a military threat, but as a burden.|sd
A|They're very large|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they can become very quickly a large financial burden, as, as one more stepchild we have to carry around.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think that's, that's a real important aspect|sv
B|and that, uh, as the, the the most, the|%
B|let's see, the more that we do, that we do or that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming, uh, you know, a reality.|sv
B|I know that, uh, this last winter was very hard on, uh, several areas in the, in the, the Ukraine, particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia, uh,|sv

B|Yeah.|b
A|And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that. Make the government do that, that's not my job.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now,|sv
B|and, uh, they've been, they've been under, under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms|sv
B|but they don't know how to act yet.|sv

B|they've got to take some responsibility for themselves.|sv
B|It's not just the government's responsibility anymore.|sv
B|You can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well.|sv
A|Absolutely,|aa

B|Real problem the last few days, one of their, uh, young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.|sd

B|sure.|aa
A|Like Oakland A's and the Giants|sv

B|Cincinnati.|sv
B|Yeah,|%

B|Huh-uh.|nn
A|Oh, I have a few times.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, they're a good ball team.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|They really are.|sv
B|They sure are.|aa
B|Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between the Rangers and the Astros.|qy
A|Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it though|qh
B|Boy,|ba
B|I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.|sv

B|That's right,|na
B|wouldn't that be something.|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|It sure would.|sv

A|Oh, there sure is|aa
A|and, uh, that, I mean they really are.|sv
A|Uh, now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him|qy^d
A|but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and, be on top.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b

B|boy,|ba
B|he's a bull, isn't he?|qy
A|Isn't he though,|qh

A|he sure is.|sv
A|He either hits home run or strike out.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|There is not ever a in between for him.|sd
B|That's right,|aa
B|it's kind of like Babe Ruth.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though.|sd
B|Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year|sv

A|To sign him again,|sd
A|yeah.|%
A|Huh.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|that, you know, may or may not happen.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|oh you never know.|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|it's a long way away.|sv
A|That's sure|%
A|if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll, they'll do a little bit of everything.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right,|aa
B|unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|no, like that Joe Hosago you know.|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|aa

A|Well I hadn't either,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|We hadn't, you know,|%
A|like I said, we,|%
A|I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I guess it's too early.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|because we usually get one.|sd
A|We usually order our tickets way in advance.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|it's a good idea,|sv
B|yeah.|%
A|We, we try to go so often.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah|b
B|if you have young, young children, you know, they, they get a kick out of it.|sv
A|Oh, they do.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
B|Well you too Lori|fc
A|And, we'll hopefully we'll get to talk again.|fc
B|Right,|b
B|you take care.|fc
A|Okay,|b
A|bye-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|b
B|bye-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|so I think, I think what we should talk about is, uh, the war.|sv
A|Okay.|b
B|The war that just went on.|sd
B|See, I, I don't agree with it.|sv
B|First of all I don't believe in war.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then, the United States has this attitude by saying, you know, thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that.|sv
B|And I think it's all independent because, it's, it has nothing to do with the United States.|sv
B|You didn't gain anything from it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving.|sv
B|It was just,|%
B|the thing, the thing that, that, that I saw was okay,|sd
B|Iraq wants to raise oil prices.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system,  by  leaving them independent.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, when Iraq, you know, saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea,|sd
B|right?|^g
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Then  the United States says, okay, our, our oil prices are going to go up.|sd
B|And like for example, see, okay, like Lithuania right, they declared themselves an independent country with a president,|sd
B|right.|^g
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Russia goes in there, well the main government in Moscow goes in there|sd
B|and they kick everybody's ass.|sd
B|And the United States doesn't go in there|sd
B|and say, listen, they were, you know, named an independent, you know, state with a president and everything|sd
B|but we're not going to go into your country.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But these countries here, which, you know, are, you know, like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR,|sv
B|have you ever read that book?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|huh-uh.|nn
B|Okay,|bk
B|NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents|sd
B|and, uh, there's just this area, like around Egypt and stuff,  that  everybody's fighting over.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now the problem is, is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right,|b
B|like their immediate boundaries. Like you're not going to go, you know, it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're, you're invading their border,|sd
B|right.|^g
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|But all the other countries, you can fight about.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so the thing is, is that you're wasting so much money to send, you know,|sv
B|it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being,|qh
A|We'll probably never know how much it actually cost.|sv
B|And you know, it's, it was basically all based on oil because nobody|sv
B|actually, like for example, if, uh, let's say if, you know Brazil took over you know, Surinam.  I  don't think anybody would care.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and, uh, that's something that, that has been, you know, very,|sv
B|because, see the thing is, is like every time that I see a war, I see myself on the front line, and on the other side I see myself again, and I've got to shoot myself, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do. You know, the same relationships that I do.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|oh, it's never a pleasant thing,|sv
A|that's true.|aa
B|And, uh, but at least it was, it was over quick|sd
B|and there weren't that many deaths.|sd
A|Yes|aa
A|that's,|%
B|Now the  only problem is, is the aftermath,  that  you're having so many deaths in the border with, uh, Turkey.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|that's really unfortunate,|sv
A|it really is.|sv
A|I don't know if we stopped too soon,|sd
A|I don't, I don't, I really don't know what we need to do about that.|sd
B|Well, there's something that, that the U S did right which is say, say, you know, okay,|sd
B|let's kick him out of Kuwait, which was our basic goal.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, now, indirectly let's try to overthrow him, you know.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And  they're not going to do that directly.|sd
B|But the thing is, is that, they, they didn't go into, into Iraq and say, you know, because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You  know, you can seek, seek asylum here,|^q
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  you can go there,|^q
B|but no way are you going to rule ever again.|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on, you know, criminal charges.|sd
A|I don't know if that will ever happen or not.|h
B|Well the thing is, is that first of all they got to, they they have to get him.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|which is very difficult to do.|sv
B|And, and there's no way that you can get them, unless it's by force.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know. And then you can put him on trial.|sd
A|Obviously, he's not going to turn himself in.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|no,|aa
B|I think, I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in, because there's, I mean there's like, it's like there's no hope, you know, like what Hitler did, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life, but where.|sd
A|True,|aa
A|yeah,|%
A|uh-huh.|%
B|You know, and so, um, the thing is, is that once you've done something wrong, which is  you  know, internationally recognized, then you're going to try to get out of it|sv
B|and the, there's no way, you know. And especially since he's got inside Iraq for using, you know, chemical weapons and stuff.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|true.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you know like he sent planes over to, to shoot the people down that were on the border with, uh, that were on their way to Turkey.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|He had a couple of them bombarded.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|obviously human life means nothing to him.|sv
B|Huh-uh.|b
B|But, uh, you know, he's got, uh, millions of dollars,|sd
B|like,  I  think it was like, I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million, which is really, doesn't make any difference|sv
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|That's true.|aa
A|Past a point it doesn't make any difference.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's really, really unfortunate.|sv
A|It really is.|sv
B|But it's just, it's just that, uh, you know, you know, like the,|%
B|we just put our goals in different, you know, levels is|sv
B|like saying, you know, it's like|%
B|yeah,|sv
B|sure,|sv
B|we need oil, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  we need it desperately.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But  the other countries, that, you know, that have oil but not as big, you know, like they say, you know, like when the prices went up and then they went down.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia,  or  something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally, though, before, before the increase started.|sv
B|Well, it, its an advantage.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You  know, it's like you're saying, okay, I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to, you know, ninety-nine cents.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Why,|qh
B|because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon,|sv
B|so if I leave it at a dollar ten, people are still going to pay.|sv
A|True.|aa
B|You know, I went down forty cents,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but  I went up ten cents.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b^m
A|About the lowest I've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is, uh, I guess, about ninety-two point nine now.|sd
B|Ninety-eight?|br
A|Ninety-two.|sd
B|Oh, God.|ba
B|Here it's like, it's like a dollar five.|sd
A|Oh really.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well there's still a lot of dollar five places here|sd
A|but you can find some that's under a dollar, but not, not a whole lot.|sd
A|That's the lowest I've seen.|sd
B|But still the,|%
B|I mean, have you ever checked, like, uh, the most money-makers in, uh, in nineteen, uh, ninety.|qy
B|Uh, you can see that, uh,  Exxon  and Amaco and uh, other companies, oh God, I forgot their names, but, uh, Exxon was the number one money-maker,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  that was just because of, of the last quarter.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|I think Mobil was doing very well, too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well I, I assume all the major, major brands are.|sd
B|And, uh, that was,|%
B|I mean and what other companies are, went up four hundred and some percent.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that's practically impossible to do now a days, for a company to,  to shoot  up in that way.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|sv
B|And, uh, it's just that, you know, people, people take advantage of that.|sv
B|You know, like the, the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when, you know, when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for, we've got to raise our prices.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, but still if you realize that, uh, one barrel has like, how much was it, like, um forty gallons,|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|something like,|h
A|yeah.|%
B|it's got forty gallons|sd
B|and they're selling, you know, you know,|sd
B|you got to pay forty dollars at least and,  you  know, for, uh, for one gallon|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it's, it was selling like at twenty-five or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So you're making, uh, you know, fifteen dollars profit, easily.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|sure.|b
B|And, uh, everything,|%
B|I mean, and, and, the expenses, you know, of the war, you know, it's like, uh, it's like who's gaining on this.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Okay,|b
B|because, uh, does, does the U S government own any gas companies, like, like, you know gas stations and stuff?|qh
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, because, see like for example, I don't know if the British government owns Shell.|sd
B|I'm not sure about that.|sd
A|I'm not sure either.|sd
B|But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it. Because, well, you know, it's like the other independent companies, the gas stations, you know, they did.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, then the taxes go up|sd
B|and then everybody else loses.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, um, you know, they're just, they're just some things that might not be worth it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|sv
B|You know, and, and first of all how many, how many people had to, had to die before the war, you know,|qh
B|it's like transporting stuff and things like that,  before, you  know, it's like|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|yeah|%
B|sure, you know, like to, to a couple people that died there, their families don't feel it was necessary to do that.|sv
A|Sure,|aa
A|dead's dead.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|you, you could, you could never bring them back.|sd
A|That's true,|aa
A|so.|%
B|Oh well.|b
A|Well, I don't guess we resolved anything|sv

A|I, I think our experience of camping is,|sv
A|I, I am the, the passive member,|sd
A|I get things ready and then I enjoy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper|sd
A|and so they,|%
A|he manages the troops|sd
A|and they do the work|sd
A|and I have fun|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was uh, all grown up now,|sd
B|how about when they were younger,|qo
B|did you go take them camping?|qy
A|That's when we camped the most.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|When,|%
A|I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,  I,  it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just, uh, was really overworked, you know,|sv
A|and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,  and  having the family do a good share of the work, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the part that I did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you know.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it.|qy
A|It is,|na
A|isn't it.|^g
A|It isn't.|ng
A|what kinds of things have you tried?|qw
A|Have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?|qy
B|Oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started|no
B|and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper. Because all you needed was a big frying pan,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Big frying|sd
B|you dumped everything  in together|sd
B|and it was enough for all five of us, six of us.|sd
A|Oh, that's interesting.|ba
A|You know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping.|sd
A|Uh, when my oldest son, uh,|sd
A|always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.|sd
A|But the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in,|sd
A|and, and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff|sd
A|and, uh,  I  mean, you know, he did it up really good|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it.|sd
B|Well that's great.|ba
A|It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do.|sd
A|And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things|sd
A|like I would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it works real good.|sd
A|It's like an oven.|sd
B|Well,  cooking was our secondary interest,|sd
A|Just  put, uh, put a thing on it.|ad
B|I mean.|h
A|What did you like to do most?|qw
B|Well really just commune with nature.|sd
A|That's neat isn't it?|qy
B|We started out, uh,|sd
B|well we were living in Florida at the time|sd
B|and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|I agree.|sd
B|So my ex decided, we're going to try camping|sd
B|and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.|sd
B|And that's how we got started.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|We  did it for years and years, uh.|sd
A|Well now in Florida, is is there are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot.|qy
B|Well, uh,|arp_nd
B|yes and no.|no
B|I mean, um, in the winter time yes,|sd
B|it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly.|sd

A|and you're in Texas,|qy^d
A|right.|^g
B|Yes,|ny
B|I'm in Dallas.|sd
A|Okay, uh,|bk
A|we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.|sd
B|Well, it just depends on where you go,|sd
B|for instance,  if you  went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water.|sv
A|I|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|we have done that|sd
A|But, but we camped mostly,|sd
A|when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and Uh, in, uh, Allendale and, uh, and, uh, Waldwick,|sd
A|it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border.|sd
A|And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp|sd
A|and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast|sd
B|Oh yes,|aa
B|yes,|aa
A|Uh, also,|%
B|I  I come from up in that area,|sd
A|go ahead.|ad
B|I'm a New Yorker myself.|sd
A|Oh, are you?|bh
A|Where did you live?|qw
B|A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains.|sd
A|Oh, oh yeah,|b
A|I know that.|sd
A|I had a cousin who lived in White Plains,|sd
A|that's a, that's a neat area.|sv
A|But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because,|sv
B|Well that I wouldn't know|sd
B|I left there when I was quite young.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,|sv
A|you don't have to go very far.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things|sd
A|and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way.|sd
B|Well, uh, me, I outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents,|sd
B|and  I now have a motor home.|sd
A|Oh, do you.|bh
A|We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis|sd
A|and it's fun, too, I think.|sv

A|Do you?|bh
B|Yes.|ny
A|That's neat,|sv

A|that sounds great.|ba

A|how do you feel about them?|qo
B|Well, I keep trying to get away from them,|sd
B|I used to use a lot of credit cards|sd
B|I guess for a while I would use, you know, a variety of the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores,|sd
B|but I think I, I impulse buy too much with them|sv
B|or I buy things, you know, I see it on sale|sd
B|and I think, oh, it's on sale I have to get it,|sd
B|and I really don't need it|sv
B|or I really haven't budgeted for it|sd
B|so, um, the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|What about you?|qo
A|Well, we have this philosophy, we use it when we go off somewhere|sd
A|but we pay for it as soon as we come back, you know,|sd
A|as soon as we get our bills, we pay it off.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we only have one.|sd
A|We tore all the rest of them up.|sd
B|okay.|b
A|Because I don't like credit cards for one thing, you know,|sd
A|I mean, they're okay, I guess,|h
A|if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on,  chapter  thirteen and stuff like that.|sd
B|Huh.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.|sv
B|That's true|aa
B|if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket.|bf
B|Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|and it gives you a, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like|sv
A|because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now|sd
A|but you're going to have to pay for it,|sd
A|and it seems like ...|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you think,  well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Are you married?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Well, I know that a lot of young people, you know, I,|sd
A|it took me a long time to get it through my child's head,|sd
A|I mean, that was her goal, you know, uh, got to have a credit card,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but now that she has one,|sd
A|she's only used it one time|sd
A|but she wanted to establish some credit,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card.|sv
A|And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh,|sv
A|well, I'll just use the credit cards|^q
A|and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|You know, and I'm, I'm thinking woman, wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.|sd
A|But  ...|%
B|Right.|b
B|Besides the fact that how much interest you pay and  then this  ...|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|and  people don't see that either.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time,|sd
B|you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|The only one that we, we have that we kept was the Discover card,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it pays you to use it.  I mean,  if you pay your bill off right away,  if you  don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest.|sd
A|Now it's,|%
A|and people say, well, you know, I'm making money by using this credit card,|sd
A|but they don't realize that if they,|sv
A|I mean, it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest,|sd
A|I mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|that's going to take up what you would have made.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|So that's the only reason that we kept that,|sd
A|we debated for a long time|sd
A|plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know,|sd
A|like ...|%
B|Service charge you mean?|br
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Yearly fee,|bf
B|yeah.|%
A|Right.|aa
A|They don't have one of those.|sd
A|So, it,|%
A|we decided that was it, you know,|sd
A|and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card.|sd
A|We have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.|sd
B|Oh, you get that stuff in the mail all the time.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes.|aa
A|And then, I'll have, just like , uh, department stores.|sd
A|They'll call me up, you know,|sd
A|and I'll say,|sd
A|look, I don't want the credit card,|^q
A|well, we're just going to send it to you, you know,|^q
A|you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to.|^q
A|They'll send me any credit card,|sd
A|I tear it up.|sd
A|I just can't see it.|sv
B|What I really hate  in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still, that they send you these things that look like checks,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know,|sd
B|all you got to do is go cash those things|sd
B|and you've got a short term loan.|sd
B|I hate it,|sd
A|I know it,|sd
A|and you know what  ...|%
B|I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.|sd
A|What's really bad about those though is just like|sv
A|young people if they don't, you know,|sd
A|we take the time to, you know, help my daughter,|sd
A|she's in college,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it, this is her first credit card thing,|sd
A|well, when she got her first one she was so excited|sd
A|it was unreal.|sv
A|Look at this they sent me this money, you know.|^q
A|So then when I explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff ,|sd
A|of course, she tore it up.|sd
A|But a lot of  parents would not take the time, you know,|sv
A|and they wouldn't even think of it|sv
A|or their kids may not be as close as my daughter|sv
A|and I|%
A|are,|%
A|and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it,|sv
A|they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know,|sd
A|they've got something,|sd
A|maybe they've won something.|sd
A|You know, somebody sent them  something free.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And go out and  spend it.|sd
A|And, um, it's just unreal.|sv
A|I mean, I don't like credit cards,|sd
A|I wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know,|sv
A|the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation.|sd
A|They would let you use it maybe once a year.|sd
A|You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time|sv
A|but, um, I have seen so many people|sd
A|and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen.|sd
A|She got, uh,|sd
A|I can't remember what she called it,|sd
A|it's some kind of,|sd
A|maybe it's sure or something like that,|sv
A|it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and she is charging out of her mind already.|sd
A|And I'm going,|sd
A|you just got off.|^q
A|That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, I can just have anything I want.|sv
A|And I just don't see it like that.|sv
A|Of course, I always see pay the bills first|sd
A|and whatever's leftover, that's what you have,|sd
A|but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that,|sv
A|but I can't stand owing.|sd
A|I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know,|sd
A|I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that.|sv
A|But, um, I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout.|sd
A|But, that's just the way I feel about it.|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation|sv
B|and that,|%
B|we think we need all these things|sv
B|and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things|sv
B|and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know,|sv
B|like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some|sd
B|but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup|sd
B|and you don't, you know, do without too much|sd
B|and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time.|sd
B|You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place|sv
B|and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have|sv
B|and actually they're kind of luxuries|sv
B|or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,  you know,  going in one big swoop, save up and then buy it.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But we're not into that.|sv
B|We're into like, have to have it all now.|sv
A|oh, yeah.|b
A|I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that.|sv
A|But, um, I guess it's because I'm older,|sv
A|I mean, I'm not real old|sv
A|but I am older|sv
A|and, um, you know, I didn't feel like that I didn't feel like I had to have everything.|sd
A|I guess it was because,|sv
A|well, I had everything when I was at home|sd
A|but I, I don't know why I didn't.|sd
B|Well, we're geared to that.|sv
B|We're like,|sd
B|okay,|^q
B|like I want a living room set. And instead of sitting back and, and going, okay, well, it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars|sd
B|and I'll save for two years,|^q
A|uh-huh.|b
B|people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.|sd
A|yeah.|b
B|People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it,|sv
B|they just put it on a charge card, put it on account, and then pay off the bill because they want it now.|sv
A|Huh.|%
B|It's always have to have it now.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, it didn't hurt you, did it, to,|qy
A|I mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?|qy
B|no,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there|sd
B|and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense.|sd
B|So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at,|sd
B|all now we're, we're, you know, we,|%
B|I use it occasionally|sd
B|but I pay it right off.|sd
B|We're ...|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, you learned then,|sv
A|right?|^g
B|Yeah,|ny
B|you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest|sd
B|and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize|sd
B|and so it's just a big chunk of money|sd
B|and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything,|sv
B|you're always just paying bills, paying bills, you know,|sv
B|you don't feel that you have any extra to save.|sv
B|And I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck.|sd
B|I like to have a little there, you know,|sd
B|that I can, save|sd
B|so I can feel that, you know, if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, .|sd
A|Jay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|my kids are, are both in college, um,|sd
A|and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.|sd
A|On the other hand, they really decided themselves.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?|qo
B|Well, I, uh,|%
B|one girl went in, in state and has graduated,|sd
B|and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,|sd
B|and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,|sd
B|and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.|sd
B|Uh, so, that was pretty much, uh.|%
A|Um.|%
A|I see,|b
A|well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,|h
A|but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.|sv
B|Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,|^2
B|I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid to it, where you get that bachelor's.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and if they can get, uh, um, two out of,|sd
B|let's see, my son got a full total scholarships|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,|sv
B|and so people should be advised to look for those,|sv
B|and, um,|%
A|Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools|qy
A|or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors|qrr
B|Uh.|%
A|and,|%
B|Well, they, uh,|^h
B|I went, we went around,|sd
B|my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,|sd
B|and so there you know,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that was limited to five or six different places|sd
B|and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,|sd
B|and I guess I played a role in that.|sv
B|I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know,|sd
B|they'd all been, uh pretty efficient as far as studies|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,|sd
B|they just, uh they just knew they wanted to go to college,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|We did do that,|sd
B|and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think that's a great idea,|sv
A|I mean, that,|%
B|Some people don't do it,|sv
B|and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,|sv
B|so if it's possible.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the compared to the, the total decision it's nothing.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|I think in the short run it is expensive.|sv
B|In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable if the person,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,|sd
B|now she's coming home at the end of the semester|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.|sd
B|She started late.|sd
B|So that's, you know, strictly up to her,|sd
B|and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but again, that's her decision|sd
A|Right.|b
B|so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,|sd
B|and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.|sv
B|So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.|sd
B|I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,|sd
B|but, uh, they have to do the work|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, uh.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, back, back to this visiting thing,|ad
A|I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and, and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in reference to what we had seen.|sd
B|Oh, I think so.|aa
B|And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.|sv
B|They've just gotten so huge,|sv
B|and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,|sd
B|see that's just too many.|sv
A|Good grief|ba
B|Ended up going to where I used to go,|sd
B|and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,|sd
B|it's twenty-one thousand, now|sd
B|it's too big.|sv
A|Good grief.|ba
B|So,|%
A|What is twenty-one thousand?|qw
B|Pardon?|br
A|What school is that?|qw
B|It's Southwest Missouri State University|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,|sd
B|and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,|sd
B|and that's, that's not bad|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I teach in a school about eight thousand,|sd
B|and that's, that's even a little large|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.|sv
B|But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then, oh, those rating, uh,|sd
B|the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,|sd
B|I don't think it hurts to look at them|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|I don't put that much stock in them,|sv
B|but|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|probably fine just to compare.|sv
A|Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.|bf
B|Right.|b
B|If they, you know, uh, they need to,|sv
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|who do you like?|qw

B|Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it is absolutely wonderful.|sv
A|Really.|b
B|And, uh, we were there a few months ago,|sd

A|I,|%

B|Oh, is it, okay.|ba
B|Wow.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,|sd
B|and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,|sd
B|but it is absolutely wonderful.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|It's the best I have ever had.|sd
A|Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,|sd

A|so,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|But it sure is good,|sv
B|and it's supposed to be good for you.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically|sd
B|Right.|b
A|so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you like spicy foods|qy
B|or,|%
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny

A|you go out to get the chicken wings|sd
A|and those are really hot and the hotter the better,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But I like it hot,|sd
B|but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|My, generally my, my scalp will start,|sd
A|I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,|sd
A|but, uh, I don't know,|h
A|but, uh,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,|sv
A|I never been really fond of that stuff.|sd
A|You talk about spicy,|sd
A|that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,|sv
A|it's so hot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,|sd
A|well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|b
A|that's one thing,|sd
B|and the price.  And the price. Make you want to come back.|^2
A|What's that?|br
A|Yeah,|aa
A|Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter,|sd
B|Go ahead.|ad
A|Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.|sd
A|I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the practice that is they,|sd
A|I, uh, I don't,|%
A|you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.|sv
A|Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.|sd
B|Do you work for T I?|qy
A|No,  uh,|nn
B|Oh.|bk
A|I'm in the Washington area.|sd
A|I work for N I S T .|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Oh, all right.|bk
B|Well, see we have the testing already here.|sd
B|We've had it for, oh, about five years.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It used to just be for new employees.|sd
B|And now  it's for all employees.|sd
A|And now,|b^m
B|They, uh, randomly select employee numbers|sd
B|and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|and how do people feel about it?|qo
B|So, we're familiar with it.|sd
B|Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.|sd
B|But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things|sd
B|and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,|sd
B|and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.|sd
A|Well, okay,|b
A|that's, that's a very different issue.|sv
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too|sd
B|so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate,|sd
B|there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,|sd
B|and I think some of those require the drug testing,|sv
B|but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in|sd
B|and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.|^q
A|And,|%
B|I haven't  personally ever been tested,|sd
B|but I don't have a problem with it.|sd
A|Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.|sv
B|You know, it happens a lot of times|sd
B|like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever|sd
B|and, you know  then  they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.|sd
A|Well ,|%
B|Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.|sd
B|It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name|sd
B|so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,|sv
B|and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.|sd
A|So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|Yes,|ny
B|yes.|ny
B|When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.|sd
B|And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs|sv
A|but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,|sd
A|so,|%
B|Well,  what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.|sv
A|The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or  something anyway .|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff.|sv
B|They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates  amphetamines.|sv
A|So what they are  asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
B|You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.|sd
B|But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled  substance  Well,|sd
A|Is Contact a,|qy
B|you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Is Contact a,  substance?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|I'm,  just saying you probably put down on the sheet  anything  you have taken.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
A|Okay.|b
B|But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.|sv
B|I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person, but was a contract person,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I|sd
B|If you are a contract employee here  they test  you too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh,|sd
B|just, he had some kind of flu or something.|sd
B|He got a real bad migraine|sd
B|and he took his mother's,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N|sd
B|and we took that,|sd
B|and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,|sd
B|and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.|sd
B|The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,|sd
B|like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|We have little ones.|sd
B|Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle  things in situations.|sv
A|It really is.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|What do you watch?|qw
A|I watch just about anything,  but  not a lot of,  T V.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I usually watch, you know, the news|sd
A|and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's the same thing we do.|sd
A|and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and  UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I haven't gotten,  into many of those.|sd
A|Now, I do,  like,|sd
A|my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.|sd

A|And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.|sd
B|Now someone told me that|sd
B|and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they  said that that was really good this season.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, his favorite night is Monday night|sd
A|so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on  Monday night,|sd
B|You've got to yeah,|bf
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because  that and then that, uh, oh,|%
A|I can't even think of the name of it.|sd
A|Like I say I'm not,|sd
B|DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .|sd
B|Huh, I don't even  know.|sd
A|Sergeant,  uh, MAJOR DAD.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Now I,  we've never  even seen that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and  DESIGNING WOMEN.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So we always, he watches that|sd
A|and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.|sd
B|On the others.|b^m
B|Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or, um,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.|sd
B|Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the|ad
B|The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.|t3
A|Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.|sv
B|Oh, I know.|aa
B|That's the thing.|sd
B|And so,  we,|%
A|Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, they are.|sd
B|In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,|sd

A|and that's SISTERS.|sd
A|Have you watched that?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|but I saw that advertised today|sd
B|and it sounds like it's not fluff.|sv
B|It sounds like it's good.|sv
A|It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean,  it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera  I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more  drama to it.|sd
A|But it's a,|%
A|So far it, I've watched it about three times now|sd
A|and it's really held my attention.|sd
A|It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good  acting.|sv
B|Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker|sd
B|and you are wanting to cocoon more,|sv
B|that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.|sd
B|Some of these,  that are nostalgic.|sd
A|Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,|sd
B|Did you,  like it?|qy
A|but I haven't,|sd
A|I did.|na
A|I  liked it.|sd

B|and,|%
A|Now I haven't seen I'LL  FLY AWAY yet.|sd
B|I haven't seen it either.|sd
B|I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's nearly,  too late for T V.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|That's  the way I am.|sd
A|I get  in,  from work|sd

A|and I'm tired|sd
A|and I sit and watch for a few minutes|sd
A|so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, it's like,  we are kind of,   tuned out of our T V.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's us.|sd
A|If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, we do too.|sd
A|But there are some good shows on.|sv

A|But I like,|sd
A|I don't know|h
A|I, I'm always in to making things|sd
A|and,  And I don't just spend all my time,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|yeah.|%
B|There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.|sd
B|They don't have children yet,|sd
B|and they just turn it on when they walk in,|sd
B|they turn it off when they leave.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|So they are used to  that too.|sd
A|I could  be around here for hours by myself and never  have it on.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I understand.|ba
B|Same here.|sd
A|But, uh,  but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,|sd
A|and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's real good.|sv
B|And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,  you know,  talk shows.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I like her.|sd
A|I never get in in time for any of those.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.|fc

B|Thank you.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Uh, I guess it's, uh,|%
A|watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime.|sd
A|In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around|sd
A|and well, I, I,|%
B|Oh, gracious.|ba
A|they've caught them|sd
A|and they, they're in there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders?|qy
B|There was that, uh,|sd
A|Well, yeah,|ny
A|Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that was really on the national news a lot.|sd
B|We heard a lot about that in Texas.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|So that's,|%
A|well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin|sd
A|so I kind of get both, both news|sd
A|and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,|sv
A|so.|%
B|Well, I can imagine.|ba
A|There .|%
B|It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me.|sv
B|I, I don't know.|h
B|I don't know if statistically they are|sd
B|but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh, that's hard to say for sure.|sd
A|I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity|sv
A|and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper|sd
B|You wonder about that sometimes.|sd
A|and they become big celebrities.|sd
A|But,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's kind of scary.|sv
B|I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories.|sv
B|Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.|sv
A|Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|we do.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Do you have it up there?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|no.|nn
B|I see.|bk
A|See I, I|%
B|Do you think that's a deterrent?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it|sd
A|but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's,|%
A|and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem,|sv
B|and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, they are really in a crisis.|sd
B|There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And a lot of them they put out on parole|sd
B|and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses|sd
B|and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before.|sd
A|Huh.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes|sv
A|than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people|sv
A|and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.|sv
B|I think that could be true too.|sv
A|Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh,|sv
B|I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And to me that's really scary.|sv
B|Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer.|sv
A|If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|They think it's okay thing to do.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|b^m
B|I think that's a very good point.|sv

A|Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.|sd
B|Is it?|bh
B|I'd have to agree with that.|sd
B|They are my favorite team, too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|A little disappointing the last few years.|sv
A|I'm telling you.|ba
A|You think they'll sign Ruben?|qy
B|You know I really don't.|sv
A|No?|br
B|I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra|sv
B|and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players.|sv
B|Oh, I do, too.|aa
B|I just,|%
A|I think that's going to be the big problem.|sv
B|The main thing,|%
B|It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|We just can't seem to, you know,|sv
B|I think we've been in this spot,|sd

B|I don't know,|h
B|I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's just, it's just too disappointing.|sd
B|I just watch them fall every year.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I was a Pete Incaviglia fan|sd
B|and, uh I liked him,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,|sd
B|decisions like that have to be made by someone|sd
B|Glad it's not me making them.|sd
A|Right|b
A|I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.|sv
A|But,|%
B|They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
B|So, and that's the name of the game, too.|sv
B|You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|now, it's just it's frightening.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.|sd
A|That's true.|aa
A|But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need.|sd
A|Because they've got the hitting,|sv
A|but they need the pitching.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they really do.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|I think they, uh, I think they need them all.|sv
B|I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities|sd
B|and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store,|sv
A|Oh, I know.|aa
B|but, I realize the difference,|sd
B|but, I just don't understand,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.|sv
B|Oh, I know.|aa
B|I tell you.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|It's real aggravating,|sv
A|but,|%
B|But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them|sd
B|because I tell you, we need a winner in this town.|sv
B|It looks like our Cowboys are coming back|sv
B|but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team.|sd
A|It's always got,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area,|sv
A|but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.|sv
B|Oh, I know.|sd
B|It's,|%
A|Just real aggravating to|^2
A|because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here,|sd
A|so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,|sd
A|so it's a lot of losers|sv
B|Oh, I know.|aa
A|It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.|sv
B|I've been one,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four|sd
B|and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time|sd
B|and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I mean I follow them|sd
B|and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys,|sd
B|but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.|sv
B|I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|I'm telling you.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I love Nolan Ryan.|sd
B|I guess you probably love him, too.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.|sv
B|Oh, I do, too.|aa
A|I mean, It would be packed.|sv
A|And they got that new stadium they are building.|sd
A|So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that,|sv
B|It will.|aa
A|but,|%
B|Well, where do you think they are heading this year?|qo
A|Uh, it's hard to say.|sv
A|It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra|sv
A|and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer,|sd
B|Right|b
A|and, man, that's getting old, you know.|sv
A|These guys have been pampered.|sv
A|I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever|sd
A|And,|%
B|and they have the later ten game winning streak|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and they give him all kinds of money|sd
B|and then he just goes right down the tubes.|sd
A|And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old.|sv
A|But I like this Sandy Johnson.|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Gene|sd

A|Yeah.|b

B|But the kids,  seem to enjoy it.|sv
A|Is that right?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, and, uh, let's see.|^h
B|We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here|sd
B|but it's, uh, not part of a chain|sd
B|it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.|sd
B|But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had|sd
B|that was, uh, not just really super.|sd
B|It's nice to find a place like that.|sv
A|Oh, boy that is wonderful.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I, I agree with you on that.|aa

A|I certainly have|na
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I hate to, uh,|sd
A|I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,|sd
A|but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,|sv
B|Okay.|aa
A|Okay.|b^m
B|Right.|b
B|Where's,|qw
A|How  do you like Chinese food?|qw
B|Oh, we, we do enjoy that.|sd
B|Yes, sir.|%
B|Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,|sv
B|we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant|sd
B|and then we usually stick by it.|sd
B|But do you,  What about you?|qo
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food.|sd
B|Hot?|br
A|Yes.|ny
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yep, uh,|b
A|it's, uh,|%
A|I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself.|sd
A|I have in the past.|sd
A|I haven't done recently,|sd
A|but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.|sv
B|Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?|qw
A|Uh, just at home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, I enjoyed the food|sd
A|and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,|sd
A|and I've been following through on that.|sd
A|When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?|qw
A|Okay,|b
A|well, that one's a good question.|^h
A|Here it's right under my nose if I can find it|sd
A|Oh, boy.|ba
B|I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|But we enjoy  trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.|sd
A|One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.|sd
A|Uh, it's a paperback|sd
A|and I think it's by someone named Chang.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|Isabelle Chang.|sd
B|Okay,|bk

A|Yeah,|bd
A|yeah.|bd
A|I think you will enjoy that.|sv
B|Okay,|b
B|good.|ba
B|Yeah.|%
A|Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene.|fc
A|And, uh, what is your phone at home?|qw
A|That's it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|What do you think are possible changes in the, uh, way trials are conducted these days?|qw
A|Do you like the way some people in there for instance, really take over and, uh, we have no way, uh, of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth.|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|What  do you think about these things?|qo
B|Well, as I look at our trial systems,|sd
B|I think they've gotten to be quite a joke. The way the people can appeal and file for mistrials|sv
B|and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage.|sv
B|I think that a jury should listen to the courts, uh, to, to the hearings and to everything,|sv
B|but I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision.|sv
B|I think the judge should hold the, or maybe even forty-nine,|sv
B|and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other.|sv
A|so you're saying you think the judge should actually have the final say?|bf
B|I think he should.|sv
B|And I think that there should be more than one judge.|sv
B|There should be maybe two, at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have like a crooked judge.|sv
A|Huh.|%
B|Do you know what I mean?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|I know what you mean.|sd
B|Um, and I think that there, it's important to have a jury, but I think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one.|sv
B|That's okay too.|sv
B|As long as it's not used to delay the trial so much.|sv
B|They need to have a fair jury|sv
B|but they only you know, would cover forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent|sv
B|and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision.|sv
A|Well, I hadn't, uh, thought of it from that point of view before.|sd
B|How do you feel about that?|qo
A|I have been in a fairly important trial,|sd
A|and, uh, what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and, uh, accurate decision.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That's the part that bothered me about it.|sd
A|Um, I really think that the, the, the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not.|sv
A|But I also think that the jury should be, uh, very, very, uh, carefully, more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate decisions.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff,|sd
A|and, and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|That's  no way to make a decision on some terrible problem.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, what if they used, you know,|qw
B|I just had a thought come as you were talking.|sd
B|What if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials?|qw
A|That would be certainly nice|sv
A|let's say|ad
A|we, we would have fifty percent of them law students,  anyway .   Yeah.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|at least.|aap_am
B|At least,  on the jury.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|And that  would give them,  experience  in the courtroom,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major.|sv
A|That's a very neat idea,|sv
A|and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|That's right.|aa
B|That would be a really good thing to do.|sv
A|That would be a, a really good thing to do.|sv
A|So it's|%
B|I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|and  what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight|sd
B|and he ran into the motorcycle.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle.|sd
B|He was just taking it home from the place.|sd
B|It was brand new,|sd
B|and his brakes did not work.|sd
A|For goodness sakes.|ba
B|And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady|sd
B|and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.|sd
A|Oh, they saw the husband,  get,|qy^d
B|That's right.|na
B|They  were following him home from the motorcycle shop.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other.|sd
B|Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,  of a  settlement,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|They would find something wrong with it.|^2
B|Until finally they won and,  said that  it was the drunk driver's fault|sd
A|Did they really?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,|sv
A|That is a shame.|sv
A|You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,  to,  to also, uh, make statements,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.|sv
A|So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|And I don't know all the details on that,|sd
B|but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Hi.|fp
A|How are you doing?|fp
B|What,|br
B|I couldn't hear you?|sd
A|I said, how are you doing?|fp

B|I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
A|We've been doing that too|sd
A|We're trying to retire in our fifties.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|This is a very appropriate topic for our, uh, conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making|sd
A|Good luck on that one, then.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|What is that?|br
A|I said good luck on that one, then.|sd
B|Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for.|sv
B|You know, the main things that I like about the uh, in the job benefits would be the, uh, the availability of the health insurance and the availability of, uh, you know, being able to transfer around, inside the organization without having, you know, when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that is working on it, like some companies I know of.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going, on going project.|sd
A|So you work for it T I then|qy^d
A|You can't say?|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|What?|br
A|Yes,|ny
A|you do.|sd
A|Well, I work for D I S D|sd
A|and I don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance,|sd
A|but Dallas doesn't pay.|sd
A|It pays most of mine, you know,|sd
A|now, after you work I think five years, they begin to pay most of it.|sd
A|But then, for the, the family, you know, I put my kids on my policy.|sd
A|It's like two hundred dollars|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and it's gone up quite a bit|sd
A|and they predict, you know, of course, it's going to keep going up.|sd
A|I wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage, at some point.|sd
A|And benefits, you know,|sd
A|I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.|sd
A|I think that would be a ,|sd
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.|sv
A|They could go visit them during the day.|sd
A|What?|^g
B|Yeah|b
B|that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children.|sd
B|But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit.|sd
B|Yes|ny
B|I do.|sd
A|Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too.|sd
A|You know, go on and pay a lump sum|sd
A|and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.|sd
A|But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay.|sd
A|But if you pay out less, then you lose that money.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|I don't like that part,|sd
A|but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.|sd
B|Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important.|sd
A|And then we got that cafeteria plan,|sd
A|do you have that?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|No.|b^m
B|I don't know what it's about .|sd
A|You can, uh,|%
A|well you,|%
A|let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance.|sd
A|It takes it out of your salary before taxes.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah|ny
B|we got that.|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|Pretax insurance?|bf
A|Yeah.|aa

A|Cafeteria?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah.|b
B|He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it|sv
A|Maybe|aap_am
A|so. Let's see what else can we do?|qo
A|Changes,|%
B|I'll tell you what we could do.|sd
A|What?|qw
B|We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because you know,|%
A|You mean, like for health insurance?|bf
B|Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company.|aap_am
B|See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Okay.|b
B|Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out.|sv
A|Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching.|sv
B|Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.|sv

A|But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.|sd
B|I know.|sd
A|It's almost impossible.|sd
B|Well, there's two schools of thought on that.|sd
B|You know, I, I'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that|sd
A|Um.|%
B|but, once you get that job with the university, you've got ten years of probation.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Then you have tenure.|sd
B|And they can't fire you.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad.|sd
B|I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.|sd
A|Well, they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, you know, in the public schools.|sd
B|But in addition.|%
A|It makes you more at ease.|sd
A|You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous.|sd
B|Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause,|sd
B|you know the governments taken care of that,|sd
B|but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid,|sv
B|and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position,|sd
B|but, on the other hand, I don't think it, you know, that someone that teaches, uh, say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all.|sv
A|Well they don't.|sd
B|Well.|%
A|In some places they don't.|sd
B|In some places that don't.|sd
A|Do they?|qy
B|But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science.|sd
B|We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications.|sv
B|I know we could.|sv
B|And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, I went to college late on in life|sd
B|and I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance|sd
B|and you might be teachable,|sd
B|you know what I mean?|^g
A|Yeah.|ny
B|I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. *listen; agree is probably degree|sv
B|It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial,|sv
B|but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards.|sd
A|What did you get your degree at?|qw
B|Industrial Marketing.|sd
A|And what's your job now?|qw
B|Well, actually I'm selling computer software.|sd
B|But, the two are mutually exclusive. Because, the, the experience that got me the job that I got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to college not my degree, which is I think kind of bizarre.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Maybe.|aap_am
A|All right,|%
A|what else could we change?|qo
A|Oh, I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching, shared, job sharing, more of that.|sd
B|Well uh, We've, we've, we've already got that.|sd
A|Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much.|sd
A|It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing.|sv
A|What else.|t1
A|I'd like to be able to, to evaluate your boss|sd
A|and it really carry some weight,|sd
A|and you get to choose your boss.|sd
B|Well,|%
B|yeah.|b
B|Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, you know, my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check.|sv
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|Well, so you get to evaluate him though?|qy
B|Well, not really.|ng
B|You know, I mean, there's, what's to evaluate about him, you know,|qh
B|I mean, my, my, supervisor level is like practically zero.|sd
B|I run the whole show.|sd
B|And when I need something, I tell my boss|sd
B|and he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and uh, that, that is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. You know, the major corporation, because so often, you know, you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, it's, it's hard for me to, you know, especially since I'm in marketing sales, you know,|sd
B|I make more than my boss. Because he's salary and I'm not.|sd
B|I make as much as I earn.|sd
B|You know, if I don't make a sale, I don't make anything|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well it's tough,|sv
B|but, uh, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make,|sd
B|but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing.|sv
B|They're just there.|sv
B|You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated,|sv
B|and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless.|sv
B|Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers.|ad
B|Swampers is a guy, who's in the union.|sd
B|He's a laborer.|sd
B|And he's assigned to,|sd
A|So, do you fish?|qy
B|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|My dad has a lake cabin,|sd
B|and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.|sd
B|It takes us about three hours to get there.|sd
B|And we go, and we fish,|sd
B|and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,|sd
B|but it's fun.|sd
A|Uh, from a boat or from shore?|qy
B|From the dock, from shore.|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
A|Uh, mostly catfish|qy
A|or,|%
B|Oh, mostly we catch carp.|sd
B|If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.|sd
B|And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.|sd
B|But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.|sd
B|What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.|sd
B|And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.|sd
B|Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,|sd
B|so we don't ever catch enough to eat.|sd
B|Carp is usually pretty much fun.|sd
B|Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.|sd
B|And that, that's a pretty good fight.|sd
B|So that's a lot of fun.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|A real light line, real light rig?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
B|They fight hard.|sd
A|Fish in Colorado different than that.|sv
B|Yeah?|bh
A|Mostly trout in the mountains.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|and in the rivers and stuff?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|yeah,|ny
A|mountain streams and rivers.|sd
B|Are they good to eat?|qy

A|very. Yeah, very much there, you know.|sd
B|Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?|qy
A|Um, by and large, no.|nn
A|But, but they're big fun.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I've been,|sd

B|I've never even tried that.|sd
B|My,|%
B|if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble|sd
A|Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.|oo_co_cc
A|You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?|qy^d
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|You're casting the weight of the line.|qy
B|With the little thing on the end.|sd

A|well,  the fly on the end weighs nothing.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I thought it had a weight.|sd
A|It weighs less than the line.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  you whip the line.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|As you whip it, over your head,  or  side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?|qy^d
A|Well, no,|nn
A|no.|nn
A|You fish upstream.|sd
B|Oh, you fish upstream?|qy
A|Right.|na
A|And then you let it carry it downstream.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then you reel it in,|sd
A|and you do it again.|sd
B|You hope that they think it's a bug and,  and eat  it.|bf

B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|we do most of our fishing at night.|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|We did not know what to do about it.|sd
A|Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.|sv

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do,|%

B|Um. Do you have any,|qy
A|You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,  out there,|sd
B|Oh, I see.|bk
A|and  you know how it is.|qy^d
A|The water's kind of,|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,|bf

A|Oh.|b

A|Yeah.|b
B|The,  uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,|sd
B|we got him a little pole last year,|sd
B|and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up|sd
B|That was what he considered fishing|sd
B|This year, he's gotten to where he can.|sd
B|We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,|sd
B|and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And he started trying to cast it.|sd
B|So, he, he was kind of getting there|sd
B|but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you guys sure want to be out of range.|sv
B|He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.|sd

A|Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?|sd
A|Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.|sv

B|So that would be neat to,  try it some time.|sd
A|It's  not,|sd
A|It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.|sd
A|But it is fun.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
A|You know,  The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.|sv
B|long as  you have a good time, that's the main point|sv
B|so,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.|sv

A|And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.|sd
B|We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.|sd
B|And we figured we were up a long way off.|sd
B|And then it rained that night,|sd
B|and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?|sd
B|And we got up the next day,|sd
B|and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away|sd
B|And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.|sd
B|So, that was kind of funny.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I just love the way it looks.|sd
B|I could almost just watch the|sd
B|we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,|sd
B|and if you were there. I mean,|sd
B|it was,|sd
B|one time we were there,|sd
B|and I guess it was late May,|sd
B|so it was really your spring almost,  you  know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,|sd
B|and the creek was just wild, just running.|sd
B|And, and all the white water and noise and the,|sd
B|it was just beautiful.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|it gets foamy almost.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|and,|%
A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I have two children|sd

A|but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and,  um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home|sd
A|and that's what I looked for|sd
A|and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,|sd
A|and that worked.|sd
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that worked out real well|sd
A|but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,  and  be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important ,  that they  do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes,|aa
B|yeah.|aa

B|I'm a college professor,|sd
A|Oh,|b
B|so,|%
A|great.|ba
B|and that's also,|%
B|and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,  and  then one or two evenings,  so  that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.|sd
A|Um.|b
A|Great.|ba
A|Oh that's, wonderful.|ba

B|I can  even teach on Saturdays and,  and  things, like that.|sd

B|So,  they, um, um,|%
B|my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so,  she is|sd
B|I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it.|sd
B|So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess|sd
B|and even though she took off two years for, um,|sd
B|I guess four years all together,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it  would be three years,|sd
B|how old's Kayla|t1
B|three, yeah,|t1
B|I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old,|sd
B|and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I guess she took off three all together|sd
B|and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home.|sd
A|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think they were really lucky there,|sd

B|And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.|sd
A|Sure,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|So I don't know what they are going to do.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  not many people can afford,  something like,|sd

B|I think,  I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're, um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so  she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so  she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a,   in a practice almost. Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty twenty-six|sd
B|so by that time she was so well established, you know,  I  guess it made it a lot easier.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Sure.|b
B|but,  uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,  if you have that,  that professional occupation where you can change.|sv
A|Oh, I do to.|aa
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|but  they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh,  lucky,  uh,|sd

A|uh, because I'm a single  parent,|sd

A|and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.|sd
B|Was it true?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|It wasn't.|ng
A|On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.|sd
A|And they had,|sd
A|it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,|sd
A|and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.|sd
B|Hm.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.|sd
A|They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.|sd
B|Uh, yes,|b
B|the cajuns.|bf
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|It was wonderful.|sd
B|They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, have you eaten crawfish yet?|qy
A|Uh, I tried it,|na
A|but I didn't care for it.|sd
A|Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.|sd
B|Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.|sv
A|That's probably true.|aap_am
A|It,|%
A|We just,|%
A|he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.|sd
B|Uh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|It,|%
B|there's all kinds,|sd
A|Probably needed some cold beer with it|sv

B|So you do eat out a lot.|qy^d
A|Quite a bit.|na
B|One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|We used to do that, once in a while,|sd
A|but we don't anymore.|sd
B|Uh, we still find it fun.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|It's fun,|aa
A|but it's just so much food|sd
A|Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable|sd
B|Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.|sd
A|Do you,|bh
A|well that makes a difference.|sv
B|And so,|%
A|Where do you go to brunches?|qw
A|Like at hotels, or restaurants there?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|uh-huh.|b
A|We eat at Shoney's.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well,|sd
B|but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that sounds nice.|ba
B|It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|I imagine it is.|ba
B|I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch.|sd
B|You know, and it's not that far.|sd
B|It's thirty miles.|sd
A|out of, which direction?|qw
B|Colorado Springs.|sd
A|Out of, which direction from there?|qw
B|West|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|west out of Colorado Springs.|sd
A|Okay,|%
A|do you have any pets?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I've had, I have had a number of them in my lifetime|sd
B|and I've,|%
B|I am a Golden retriever fan,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.|sd
A|Oh|b
B|Yes.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|Instead of being carried|bf
B|Yes,|aa
B|well, they were,|sd
B|they really wanted something teeny tiny,|sd
B|and I, uh, really wanted that retriever's disposition. Uh, the ultimate to tolerant, trainable disposition,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Really.|b
B|so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get.|sd
B|And they all said, Golden Retriever|sd
B|and I said okay, put it under twenty pounds.|sd
B|And the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Do you know what that is?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I've seen those.|sd
A|They're cute.|sv
B|They're cute.|sv
B|They look like an air headed let me tell you.|sv
B|They're calm, they're not yuppie , they're trainable, they're, uh, very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is.|sv
B|They're not dignified like a retriever can be.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|So how old is your retriever?|qw
A|Oh, she's about four.|sd
A|She's not completely pure.|sd
A|We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy.|sd
A|She looks like a|sd
A|she looks just like a Golden Retriever,|sd
A|but she's a little bit smaller.|sd
A|She's like fifty-five pounds.|sd
B|Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females.|sd
B|What you,|%
A|Is it?|qy
B|yeah,|ny
B|what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers, this, you know, plus eighty to a hundred pound range.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That is not breed standard.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Fifty-five is the minimum|sd
B|but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five.|sd
B|And the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.|sd
A|Oh, huh.|b
B|So don't say she's small, just say she's perfect.|ad
A|Yeah.|b
A|She's perfect.|b^m
A|Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't|sd
B|Yep.|aa
A|but, but we love her anyway.|sd
A|She's just a lot of company to us.|sd
A|We didn't,|%
A|we haven't had any kids|sd
A|and we're expecting a baby this summer,|sd
A|but up until then, she's been our substitute kid|sd
A|and she was a lot of fun.|sd
B|Well, they are, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because I had a retriever, actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross. Which is a really nice animal|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Oh.|b
B|and fortunately it was just like a retriever|sd
B|and then I've had a retriever.|sd
A|I bet it had a pretty coat too.|sd
B|It was gorgeous.|sd
B|It was just gorgeous. I mean just gorgeous.|sd
B|Um, and they both, you know,|sd
B|both the half breed and the pure breed had the, uh, what I consider the, the, the perfect disposition.|sd
B|But you know what, you know what scares me about Golden Retrievers?|qh
B|Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders. Which is probably where yours came from. People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic.|sd
B|And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better.|sd
B|And when you start doing that you really tamper with, you know, the, all the, the years of, uh, culling litters|sd
B|and, and, uh, you tamper with what the dog innately is.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|We|%
B|when I was,|%
B|when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And I ended up getting one that, uh, came out of a, a, a hunting stock because I wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb, dumb retrievers|sd
B|and I'm, and I really fear for the breed because I love that breed,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.|sd
A|We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever|sd
A|and those dogs have been having seizures,|sd
A|and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|You bet you.|aa
B|You bet you.|aa
B|You know how they came up with the retriever, don't you, the Golden?|qy^d
A|Huh-uh.|nn
B|It was bred out of several different retrievers,|sd
B|and they bred it for companionship and, uh, uh, disposition and, and ability to hunt.|sd
B|It was kept only by kings.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years|sd
B|and since it slept in the castle with its master, I mean it had, it had to be of a disposition to make it, you know, an animal you could keep around that closely.|sd
B|But they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect.|sd
B|Now, you know, that seems like a cruel thing to do.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|On the other hand, you sure, you know, they sure created a, a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|They did.|sv
A|I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before.|sd
A|We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds|sd
A|and all the other,|%
A|we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs|sd
A|and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down.|sd
A|And one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling|sd
A|And that, was mine.|sd
B|Well, I tell you, you know the, the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German Skutzhund, and a makes a I always forget the third one. I can see it.|sd
B|Uh, uh,|%
B|but the third one is a children's dog.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And there are distinct breeds in Europe.|sd
B|Now what happened over here was is that people saw the, the first, um, which would actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.|sd
B|And it was known as a German shepherd here.|sd
B|So they created a breed standard. The American Kennel Club did.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, uh, Alsatian that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.|sd
B|And they bred a dog that I it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you.|sd
B|That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them, because they would turn on on their handlers.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible.|sd
B|So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this.|sd
B|So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be. Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.|sd
B|It's just,|%
B|you see them in Europe|sd
B|and they're just lovely.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|But you'll see,|sd
B|I mean, if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German Shepherds, they will say on them, bred for disposition, A K C conforming which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|This is bred for,|sd
B|and they had to go through and destroy a, for a while there, about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Because they were looking for this disposition.|sd
B|And nowadays you, you'll get, you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific, you know, breeder handler.|sd
B|They will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|But ...|%
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|well, I'll start off being controversial.|sd
A|I'm in favor of it.|sd
B|That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.|sv
A|Well, it seems to be in the current situations|sd
A|but, uh, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.|sv
B|Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.|sv
A|Okay.|b
B|I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think, uh,|sv
B|Crimes against children is one of them.|sd
A|Oh, definitely.|aa
A|Any, any crimes against person, uh, I feel, uh, there should be more than a slap on the hand, and being sent to prison and being released in, uh, two or three years.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Actually, I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries.|sd
B|If you steal, you lose a hand.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|That's a,|%
B|You know, uh, if you kill, you lose your life.|sv
B|What's wrong with that?|qw
A|I don't see a thing wrong with that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I believe that, uh, Well, it's just an, an example.|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|I think there's, uh, someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they were interviewing the, the,|sd
A|a young lady was killed sometime back, a young girl.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, how do you feel about this?|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, you know|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they want the person punished and punished, properly.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Deciding what that proper punishment is, is one thing.|sv
B|I think that there should be no way, I, I realize that innocent people could go to, uh, what is it, lethal injection now.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|Innocent people could do that,|sv
B|but for every innocent person who would be executed, hopefully there would be ten guilty.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I feel like the, the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost, at like thirty thousand dollars, a year to keep someone in prison.|sd
B|Uh, Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|To maintain a prison|bf
B|that's right.|aa
B|That's stupid.|sv
A|And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There are more, and more instances being on the news,|sd
B|Sure.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|or this individual was out on the streets, on probation or parole and killed someone else. Or, seriously injured someone.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|b
B|Sure.|b
B|Well, I don't have solutions to the problems,|sd
B|but you know you have these,|sd
B|this would be nice if|sv
B|and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory, blinded her.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual or the family of an individual. Uh, who has been harmed you, you, you know.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|indeed.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|People who kill policemen. And I|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|No.|aa
A|Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind uh, the opportunity exists for someone to get killed.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, uh, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. Uh, aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the, the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.|sv
B|I don't, I don't agree with the length, of the sentence though.|ar
A|Well, Well, but here again, uh, if a matter of expediency, part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years.|sd
B|I think expediency is the answer.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|There should be some, uh,|sv
A|I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, uh, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years, because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities, there might be.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right,|aa
B|technical,|b^m
B|I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|there's got to be a, there's got to be a time limit.|sv
B|you can appeal it once.|sv
B|I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands, then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is, if, if it is, contradictory.|sv
A|A, a legit, legitimate appeal, not a technicality, of, uh, if, and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's right.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, uh someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|Well, one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of, of the process in which the criminals were apprehended.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, uh, you know the guy is guilty.|sv
B|You know he's done what he's done.|sv
B|You, you may have stood there and seen it.|sv
B|But because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested, you know, he, he goes free.|sv
A|He didn't see his, lawyer as quickly as he should have, or some, some Mickey Mouse type thing like that.|bf
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right,|aa
B|and I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent.|sd
B|It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.|sv
A|Oh, yes|aa
B|And, uh, I, I just don't think that,|sv
B|I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|I hope you're not a lawyer|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I'm not a lawyer|ng
A|I,|%
A|I'm an accountant|sd
A|and I agree.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers, to a degree.|sd
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|That's why you check books out from the library.|sv
A|There you go.|aa
B|But I really believe that our justice system is, is the best around|sv
B|but it's not perfect,|sv
B|and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact. *in tact intact|sv
A|Well, it's, it's a case that we have a, a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|So that's how we get caught in this, uh sort of a catch twenty-two.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|But you have to continue, uh, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|And, and, it,|%
B|I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|And that just,|%
B|that really does ruffle my feathers, at times.|sd
A|Yes It does, most people.|aa
B|I mean I can just get so, aggravated about it.|sd
B|But, you know, it's, it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem|sv
B|And I hope, not lawyers|sv
A|Again one of our one of our problems is that, uh, our legislature and the state and our national congress, the majority of the members thereof are lawyers.|sv
A|Well, uh, if you had to pick a, a type of music that you like, would you be able to? *functions as a qw|qy

B|If you had to pick one, what would you choose?|qw
A|Uh, I would probably go with,|sd
A|it's tough, uh, I think I would just stick with the classics. Only because, uh, I like music just for music's sake|sd
A|and uh, you know, I'm from the era where, you know, we had all the rock and roll.|sd
A|I'm forty|sd
A|so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal|sd

A|and, you know, the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound.|sd
A|Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart|sd
A|I mean because it's just,|sd
A|it will always be there.|sd
A|It's classic|sd

A|so, there you go|h
B|Well, I understand what you're saying.|sd
B|I think if you would listen to it a little, you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the, both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that, that we both lived through.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Uh|%
A|I,|%
A|it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too.|sv
A|I, I know, well, whenever they talk about, uh, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me.|sv
A|It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.|sv
B|Well, there's some joy in it also.|sd
B|But, mostly it, it just tells a story about life.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I must say, though, uh, I listen to Amy Grant.|sd
A|Do you consider her country?|qy

B|I'm not all that familiar with her work.|sd
A|Uh, uh, let's see. Well, name some people that are country that I should listen to|ad

B|Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.|ad

B|Besides don't sweat the small stuff|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that's good, that's real good advice.|sv
A|and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And keep your mind on positive things|ad
A|and, and stress that to your children.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, even if they're, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are, uh, not negative and that are positive things in their life|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern|sv
A|and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
B|Well, I would agree with that.|aa
B|We're also real active in our church|sd
B|and my kids do an awful lot with that.|sd
B|Allyson sings in the choir.|sd

B|I'm real proud of her.|sd
B|I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing.|sd
B|You know, that's, that's real neat.|sd
A|Well, if she looks, if she looks at it as you suggest that, that that's, that she can give her, her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and, and, uh, that's ...|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Do you work?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|I do.|ng
A|I think that's the main change.|sv
A|What do you think?|qo
B|Well, I think that's a big part of it|sv
B|and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home|sv
B|and,  I  almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.|sv

A|That's right.|aa

A|Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.|sd

A|You have children?|qy^d

B|Yes.|ny
B|I have two|sd

B|but I just,|%
B|I,|%
B|the kids are so wonderful|sd
A|Yeah.|b

B|my mama I remember her being home uh,  you know,  she made breakfast in the morning for us.|sd
A|Yep.|b
A|Fine .|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yep.|aa

A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and,|%
A|Well,  I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,  which I loved.|sd

A|And I'm home when they are home.|sd
A|In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store,|sd

B|So, where do you see,  us changing in the future?|qw
A|I don't.|sd
B|Well, see that was one of the things the, the question I think is,  you know,  what changes do we see|sd
A|I keep on working .|sd
A|Right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere.|sd
B|I think they are still going to have to work.|sv
A|That we are because it's so expensive.|bf
A|If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,|sd

A|for two.|b^m

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Thank goodness I have mine,|sd
A|and I could get a real good paying job,  if I wanted  to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,|sd

B|and I can work part days in my husband's business, you know, so that,  he can afford for us to do that,  you know.|sd
A|Oh, that would be great.|ba
A|Right.|aa
A|I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children.|sv
B|So, Utah.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Yes.|aa

A|Some,|%
A|a gentleman, uh, that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned, well, appealed again.|sd
A|I guess we have the longest, uh, running inmates for death row  too.|sd

A|And then we had another guy, uh, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|He just got a, a new trial because, the judge felt that he was incompetent.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, how do you feel about the death penalty?|qo
B|Well, I, you know,|%
B|until recently I've been sort of,|sd
B|could go either way, you know,|sd
B|it, it, sort of doesn't much, you know,|sd
B|it didn't,|%
B|it wasn't a strong issue, um, I guess it still isn't a strong issue.|sd
B|But I must say, I find it very silly, the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes, um instead of dealing with you know, the real problems that, you know, that they're, they're getting votes presumably by, um,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I assume they're doing it for that reason|sd
A|Well, I'm sure that's  .|sv
B|By,  by by saying well, this, doing this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.|sv
A|Well, I kind of agree with terrorism.|sd
A|I think those guys should be done away with.|sv
A|That's one of the worst,  crimes  in my book|sv
A|and, uh, drug dealing, um, that's close|sv
A|but, uh, terrorism definitely.  And  uh,  selling out your country.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's not,  it's not enough just to lock them up forever.|sv
A|Uh, no,|aa
A|it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.|sv
B|Not often.|aap_am
A|Not very often at all.|aa
A|We've got these guys in New York that, uh, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, uh, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the  tennis  people.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah|b
A|And I guess they got convicted, the four, of uh, murder.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?|qy^d
B|Well, I,|%
B|I've|%
B|it, it seems like it's gone, gotten carried away,|sv
B|um, and I, I do find it hard to know where to draw a line,|sd
B|and so if I had to draw a line, I'd say just no capital punishment.|sd
B|I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot, whereas I do think that convicting people and, and incarcerating them for a long time, if that could be improved upon, that would have more impact, I think.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|You kind of hate to,|bf
B|No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|what about the argument where, where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a, a more serious capital crime?|qh
B|I mean, murder, um, because that one at least, you might escape from because his victim, you know, his witnesses will be gone|sv
B|Doesn't this, doesn't this encourage,  Uh,   More .|qy
A|You  mean  uh,  violence?|qy
B|Doesn't this, yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the the witnesses?|qy
A|The witnesses?|^2
A|Well, maybe it would.|no
A|Uh, I kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment, uh, as it is.|sd
A|I think that people who, uh, infringe on other people's rights, uh, and screw up their whole lives with rape, uh, child molesting, uh, terrorism, just  uh,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|There's just like five things that I think they ought to be snuffed for,|sv
A|but I'm, I'm for it for certain reasons.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I think that things like rape, uh, you can't get over, uh,  it takes a lifetime.|sv
B|I see,|b
B|so, so  if, if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty, you believe he should have been, uh, executed?|qy^d
A|Uh,  if it was,  Yeah.|arp_nd
B|A six  person jury could have decided either way, of course|sd
A|If it was, it would probably have to be a pattern.|sv
A|You know, we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out, do the same thing and go back,|sd
A|and, uh, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child  molesting  then snuff them.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, the problem is that they've just been let out of jail.|sv
A|Pardon?|br
B|The problem there is that they've been let out jail.|sv
B|If they've been thrice convicted, they should have been kept in longer.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|but we don't seem to keep them long enough,|sv
A|and then they learn such bad things in jail.|sv

A|it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around  to  keep giving them chances.|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Uh, let's see,|^h
A|so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in, uh, compares to how we feel|sd
A|What's the laws there in D C?|qw
A|Uh, it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year|sv
A|but, uh, it's, it's camping.|sd
B|Really.|b
B|When was the last time you went?|qw
A|The last time I went camping was about, uh, in the middle of October,|sd
A|and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it.|sd
A|Had a real good time with the family.|sd
A|We do an awful lot of camping.|sd
A|How about yourself?|qo
B|Well, I haven't been in probably about three years.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the last time we went was in, um, well, I guess it was, it was like hunting season,|sd
B|and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake Lake Sam Rayburn which is in East Texas.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes, oh,|b
A|Very good.|ba
A|I bet it's pretty over there.|sv
B|It is real pretty.|sd
B|Um, let's see.|^h

B|Do you do a lot of fishing?|qy

B|A tent?|br
A|Yes|ny
A|So I guess we really rough it.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|And we really enjoy that.|sd
A|Uh, one thing, uh, I've done all sorts of camping.|sd
A|I've, I've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier.|sd
A|I've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out.|sd
B|So you're a serious camper.|bf
A|Well, we enjoy it, yeah.|aa
A|But since I've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms And playgrounds, and so forth,|sd
B|Well, that makes sense.|ba
A|so, we really enjoy it.|sd
A|But also while I was growing up, we did have a trailer,|sd
A|and, uh, I camped in that trailer and in a tent and in, in log cabins and so forth too.|sd
A|So a lot of different things.|sd
A|And yes,|%
A|I,|%
A|to answer your questions earlier, yes, I, we do enjoy fishing,|sd
A|and I do go fishing.|sd
A|Haven't done a whole lot down here.|sd
A|We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, uh, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, uh, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, uh, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers.|sd
B|But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean,|qy
B|what did you normally do?|qw
A|We normally, yeah,|sd
A|we did, we did a lot of the fishing,|sd
A|but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going out and seeing what there was to see, uh, in the area.|sd
B|I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,|sv
B|and you do actually camp.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|aa
A|That's true,|aa
A|that's true.|aa

A|we never did that.|sd
B|ever done that?|qy
A|They|%
A|although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds, uh, we've never done that just to go around and camp.|sd
A|Um, personally, I, when I, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, K O A is, is geared for the people that have a  hookup.|sd
B|That actually  travel, what, city to city, state to state.|bf
A|Right,|aa
A|exactly,|aa
A|and, uh, I started out basically camping when I was, when I was in Boy Scouts,|sd
A|and we did an awful lot of that as, as a Boy Scout group.|sd
A|As I mentioned earlier, we went into wilderness areas|sd
A|and we camped in the snow, and in, uh, snow caves,|sd
A|and, and, uh,|%
B|That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.|sd
A|All right.|b
A|And you got a lot of that in, huh?|qy
B|Yeah|ny
A|What do you like to do when you go camping?|qw
B|Um, well, let's see. I just, I mean, I just like to go|sd
B|and, normally I go with a whole group of friends|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.|sd
A|Enjoy it, huh|qy
B|Roast marshmallows.|sd
A|Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire|bf
A|and,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|or, um, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, um, play cards and stuff.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|You know, lots, a lot of people I've talked to have said, well, isn't camping boring?|sd
A|Don't you get, don't you, uh, get bored and not have anything to do,|^q
A|but I've found out that actually we, we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's relaxing.|sv
A|and, yes.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
A|Get out,|sd
A|getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.|sd

A|they really do, they have a great time,|sd
A|and like I mentioned, uh, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year|sd
A|and the last time was in October|sd
A|and we went up to Lake Bonham,|sd
A|and there was a playground for them|sd
A|so they had swings,|sd
A|Um,|%
B|So you have a son?|qy^d
A|I have an older son,|na
A|yeah.|ny
A|He doesn't have any children yet though.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, he's thirty-seven|sd

A|but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That,|%
A|I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.|sd
A|You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.|sd
A|So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we let the dogs outside|sd
A|and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs|sd
A|but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.|sv
B|I would think so.|aa
B|When you,|%
B|when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working?|qy
B|Did you work|qy
B|or were you able to stay at home with him?|qrr
A|No,|nn

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but we always had our days off together|sd
A|and we went camping on vacations.|sd

B|Well when my mom, uh,|sd
B|when I was growing up my mom worked too,|sd
B|but she worked nights and, uh, as a nurse|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so she was always home for us|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,|sd
B|but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh yeah.|aa
A|Well I am sure it was, you know.|sv
A|But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.|sv
A|Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, it's really rough.|sv
A|Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman|sd
A|and he works like four days on|sd
A|and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days,|sd
A|but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.|sd
A|So, he's got a second job.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|So he's, you know he's not home very often.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And that's, you know,|%
A|the kids I know miss that.|sd
B|They  really do.|aa
A|You know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.|sv

A|or,|%
B|Oh yeah.|ny
B|Oh yeah.|ny

A|That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they will be married nine years this year.|sd
A|So, I don't know.|h
A|She's a nurse, you know|sd
A|and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids,|sd
A|so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's a possibility.|sv
A|You know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, We  really want to have a family.|sd
B|We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|so,|%
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Give them, give them an edge,|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|But then,  a family is, is definitely a high priority.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children|qy

B|but, still we will share that job.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|it, it's actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married,|sd

B|it, it|%
B|she's, she's picked up a lot of things, uh, just, just by, uh, teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.|sd

B|Okay.|b
A|It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd|sd

B|Okay.|b
A|So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom|sd
A|and she used them there.|sd
B|Oh.|b

B|but, we've always got, uh, got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She's definitely ready to get out and run around.|sd

A|Uh, she'd rather sleep outside on the, the cold ground at night.|sd
B|Oh wow.|ba
A|But, uh, I do make her come in.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in,|sd

A|I have a, a thirty foot cable, running from one stake to another,|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|and then attached to that is a, uh, twelve foot leash,|sd

B|Most definitely.|aa
A|And, uh, she's the best, uh, burglar alarm going.|sd

B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|that's, uh, definite security involved in, uh, in a dog like that.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|she, uh,|%
A|it's the strangest thing, though, uh, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, uh, right up to her,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and adults.|sd
B|Yeah,|b

A|But, uh, she is a great comfort to me.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I know our dog has had, uh, some different reactions,|sd
B|she's never really been around children|sd
B|and, uh, if, if the child is, is pretty straight forward, um, she's fine.|sd
B|If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump around and, and yip and bark quite a bit,|sd
B|and if the child gets scared, uh, she's still trying to play, but she doesn't completely understand what's going on|sd
B|and we've had a little confusion with, with, uh, with younger kids.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, you know, that's,|%
B|it's a matter of exposure really.|sv
B|Um, we, uh, took her home to, uh, my family's place in South Dakota,|sd
B|and she was the one that was intimidated then.|sd
B|There was about seven kids ranging from about, uh, three years to ten years running around the house all at one time, you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|and, the dog kind of, kind of felt out of place then because she was, she was being fed, and everything else from all directions.|sd
B|She really didn't know how to handle herself.|sd
A|You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.|bf
B|She really did,|ar
B|she just, uh,|%
B|she, she was she was just inundated with, with all the attention.|sd
B|Uh, she, she kind of, she kind of sat and it all in for a little while|sd

A|but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I had, uh, a similar, uh, experience.|sd
B|I, I grew up on a farm|sd
B|so I always had, uh, outdoor pets|sd
B|and, uh, the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a, uh, Springer Spaniel, black Lab cross.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he was a real, a real lovable type, but, uh, definitely not an apartment type animal|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|so he, uh, he had to stay home.|sd
A|Oh, what a shame.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|it really was.|sd
B|He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for a little while|sd

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|oh well.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,|sd

A|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Amy, how are you doing today?|fp
B|Fine,|fp
B|fine.|fp
A|All right,|b
A|I think we know what we're going to speak about.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I tell you what, I'll start off.|oo_co_cc
A|How's that?|qw
B|Okay,|aa
B|you go ahead.|ad
A|Um, I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals, criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends, in public places.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|In public places.|^2
A|There is one state that does that, by the way.|sd
B|Really?|bh
B|What is that?|qw
A|I want to say Oklahoma,|sd
A|I saw something the other night about it.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|They don't do them real often. Which is obviously the death penalty.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, but I think if we quit, uh, building, these Taj Mahals with the color T V and sixty sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with|sv
A|and let's just screwing up the system.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, the sentences are so unbelievable.|sv
B|I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in jail is two years before he's paroled, and a rapists is like six months, and a burglar is like two months.|sd
A|That's pathetic.|sv
A|That's pathetic.|sv
B|Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them|sd
B|or, you know, it's just that, it seems like the automatic sentences, if, if a judge has leeway, on what he's going to, you know, sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you know, what's his whim to decide it should be two months.|sv
A|This is true,|aa
B|You know, it's crazy.|sv
A|an, and the way the law reads, uh, if they sentence you to life in prison, then he's available for parole.|sd
A|If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, what, you know,|%
A|let's quit B S with the system.|sv
B|Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.|sd
B|We could spend that money, you know, for children that are starving, or twelve million other things would be more useful than that.|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
B|So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt they should, that should be it.|sv
A|A life for a life.|bf
B|You know particularly for some of these really, I mean,|sv
B|there are so many just major, major serial murders,|sv
B|it's not just like one instance, or something, it's just, uh, horrifying, some of the murders that go on.|sv
A|The old Charles Manson case.|sd
A|I mean the guy is really, just shouldn't be allowed to, to even, even live.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|an,|%
B|yeah,|aa
B|there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, about the issue about sentencing by the judge.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The, the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene, uh, when there's a, my understanding, when there's uh, a verdict|sd
A|and it|%
A|for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four|sd
A|and bam, bam the guy got off.|sd
A|Uh, he was, he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I heard about that on the news.|sd
A|Uh, it kind of gets back to the second request,|sd
A|we've been asked to look at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict.|sd
A|In a situation like that, I'd say no,|sd
A|let's just go like a regular vote.|^q
A|Eight to four tells me that there were eight,|sd
A|there's a certain percentage of the people there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people said, hey, they guys guilty.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Rather than have to retrial the whole, whole thing and spend all the money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers|sv
B|and, I mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a, you know, a fortune to keep doing that.|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
B|And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution.|sv
A|Exactly,|aa
A|because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|I think that, that if it's, if it's not a split decision, go with the highest number|sv
A|and let's just get on with the program.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
A|Uh, what are your feelings?|qo
B|Well if I,|%
B|I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida,|sd
B|and she just has, just really stiff penalties|sd
B|and I saw that in, in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really, you know, took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have a, a judge that would really make a good impact.|sd
B|But likewise, you could have the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had a good old boy network|sv
B|or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all kinds of people through|sv
B|so, he, he would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, you know, if used wrongly.|sv
B|So at least the jury system does something to prevent that, you know, or help it with it anyway.|sv
B|I don't know if it prevents it,|sd
B|but, seems like the jury system does have it's advantages.|sv
B|But I also, I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient, you know,|sd
B|and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers, at that point, they're really getting a select group.|sd
B|It's not just random people.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on a list are the ones that are on the jury|sv
B|and that's it.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.|sd
A|Well give me a break, you know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something,|sv
B|yeah.|%
A|Exactly,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|I mean you're, you're in Dallas|sd
A|so everybody,|sd
A|I can't believe they can,|sd
A|uh, like in a murder situations, they look for juries who don't know anything about the system, well or know anything about the, the occurrence,|sd
A|you'd have to be pretty dense,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|you'd be, you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock, or somewhere, possibly is not the answer.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically.|sv
A|This is true, so true.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Well this has been an interesting conversation.|sv
B|Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors, I mean,|sd
B|what can I say.|qh
A|So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.|bf
B|No,|aa
B|I'm at home with two little preschoolers.|sd
B|My husband works for T I.|sd
A|Oh, that's good,|ba
A|that's good.|ba
A|I thought I heard a holler there in the background,|sd
A|but I wasn't sure.|sd
B|Oh yeah,|aa
B|I've got the dog and two kids waiting here,|sd
B|I'm just locked up in the laundry room|sd
A|Oh goodness,|ba
A|well, I'll let you get,|oo_co_cc
B|Okay,|aa
B|thanks a lot.|ft
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|I enjoyed it.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? and background|qw
B|Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,|sd
B|and, uh, I really don't know the answer,|sd
B|uh, I would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.|sd
A|Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|well, yeah|ny
B|I like, I like some of those things.|sd
B|They come in really handy sounds in|sd
A|What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider,|qw
A|you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the,|sd
A|well, what do you call them,|t1
A|you said amenities, that they have,|sd
B|Amenities.|b^m
A|but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price.|qw
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, of course, I guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,|sv
B|but,|%
A|It is for me,|sd
A|other people, don't seem to have the same problem|sv
B|yeah.|b
B|Well, that's, that's a big one in my book,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,|sd
B|and I would sort of like to buy American,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else,|sd
B|how about you?|qo
A|Well, um, the last car we bought was American because of, because of that reason,|sd
A|but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car,|sd
A|it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Because several things, minor things sort of,|sd
A|but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new, you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we bought the car new|sd
A|and after,|%
A|um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable ,|sd
A|and I said, since when?|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Brake pads are disposable , you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|we know that,|sd
A|but I never thought a clutch was disposable.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I wouldn't have thought so either.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|so that was, that was kind of a shock|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars,|sv
A|they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz,|sd
A|they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, especially not after two years.|sv
B|No|aa
B|but then,|%
B|No,|aa
B|but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune.|sd
A|Really?|bh
A|Oh I don't know.|h
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh, Mercedes|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive.|sd
B|But for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too, to own them .|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|What kind of,|qw
A|what brand of car are you thinking about buying|qw
A|or like what things are you looking at?|qw
B|Well, I haven't really gotten that far with it, um,|sd
B|I've always sort of liked General Motors, a little bit better than some of the others|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, oh, I guess, I really don't know.|h
A|How come|%
A|I've been kind of, um,|sd
A|I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that,|%
B|I think that's,|%
A|I think they have a really good, uh, quality.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,|sd
B|and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them|sd
B|but it's not too bad,|sd
B|and the reason,|%
B|one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years|sd
B|and he lived way out in the country|sd
B|so he put a lot of miles on it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good,|sd
B|so, I thought they would|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|They seem to be really durable.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, I don't know,|h
A|I'm, I'm not ready to buy a new car yet,|sd
A|but I don't know, if, if the next time I'm going to try to, to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long-term investment|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well,|%
B|and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know,|sv
B|you ...|%
A|Oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|it gets excellent gas mileage.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones like one music|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, we talked long enough|ad
A|I think so.|aa
B|Okay,|b
B|well, enjoyed it.|fc
A|All righty,|fc
A|thanks and background|ft
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|well, go ahead,|ad
B|I'll let you start.|oo_co_cc
A|Uh, I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, uh, be required to do public service for a year or two.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family,|sd
A|or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to.|sd
A|I mean, you can't make it everybody.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and, and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|or it could be like the draft where, you know, before they draft you, they uh, you get a physical anyway.|sv
B|So when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical|sv
B|and if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted.|sv
B|It doesn't matter how rich you are.|sv
B|That would be good.|aa
A|And then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members,|sv
A|right.|^g
B|What did you say?|br
A|Give physicals to the rest of the family members|sv
A|and they all had to pass.|sv
B|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Uh.|%
A|Uh, I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|And, uh, if they did this, maybe help them out in their college cost|sv
A|and maybe they could pay people for doing this, at least something,|sv
A|so they could subsist.|sv
B|Well that's true.|aa
B|America's paying all this money to have other people give, uh, aid to other countries,|sd
B|so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because, actually, when you, when you do, uh, service overseas you end up learning something, usually that's, that's really useful, plumbing, or farming, or, or something like that,|sd
B|so you're really learning a skill|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and you know all these old people, they would get out of this right.|sv
A|All the ones that are already retired.|sd
A|So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.|sv
B|What did you say?|br
B|Uh-huh.|%
A|I'm just teasing|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I, think, well that's probably the idea,|sv
B|I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country, or outside the country.|sd
A|Well I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries|sv
A|and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that would be neat,|sv
B|yeah|aa
B|sort of like an exchange program.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that'd be sort of neat.|sv
B|I like the idea of, uh, being, uh, a mandatory thing for welfare.|sd
B|Course that's what, um,|%
B|that's sort of like what Truman had,|sd
B|or was it Roosevelt,|qrr
B|I can't remember, um,|sd
B|with the big,|sd
A|Oh with W P A.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|Getting people, uh,|%
B|the, the work program and all the, all the make work jobs.|sd
B|That was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building.|sd
A|And we're still using those things too.|sd
B|What did you say?|br
A|We're still using those things.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true a lot of them are still out there.|sd
B|Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why.|sd
A|They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake.|sd
B|Lake what?|br
A|Caddo Lake.|sd
B|Caddo Lake.|b^m
A|It's between Texas and Louisiana,|sd
A|it crosses into both of them.|sd
B|No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|I've never heard of it.|sd
A|Well, it's real pretty,|sv
A|it's like a swamp.|sd
B|Oh|b
A|You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's really, it's eerie.|sd
B|Oh okay,|bk
B|real pretty, like a swamp,|b^m
B|oh yeah.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, okay,|bk
B|yeah,|b
B|I been, uh,|%
B|I got, uh, talked to someone else before that was a, uh, a Texan,|sd
B|but I guess that's, uh, that's what we're going to have.|sd
B|This is, uh, a T I experiment to see how talk,|sd
B|Texans talk to other people.|sd
A|I don't know,|sd
A|where are you from?|qw
B|Uh, Virginia.|sd
A|Virginia,|b^m
A|oh, that's neat,|ba
A|I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night.|sd
B|Oh yeah,|aa
B|it is neat to get other people. Especially since you got other, uh, ideas about how people, uh, how people react to things and stuff. Especially when it comes to, um, social services.|sv
B|Uh, uh, I'm glad they have a lot of, uh, um, you know, topics on social services, because, like this thing, this is a pretty good idea.|sd
B|I didn't even know if they were thinking about it.|sd
B|I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone, somewhere is really thinking, that, uh, it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service.|qy
A|There is somebody|sd
A|and I, , uh, I can't remember who it is|sd
A|but there's a really famous,|sd
A|of dang,|ba
A|I can't remember.|sd
B|Politicians pushing it, or, uh or Mitch Snider. Or Mitch Snider.|bf
A|That proposed it,|sd
A|I read something in PEOPLE about it.|sd
A|Huh.|br
A|Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.|sd
B|Oh, okay,|bk
B|well see that's a D C thing.|sd
B|Mitch Snider is the, the advocate for the homeless that, uh, he, he's said it out here in Washington|sd
B|but he started the um, uh, the movement for creative nonviolence.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|he started that|sd
B|and that, that was basically a, you know, donate time and money to, uh, help the homeless,|sd
B|but, uh. uh,|%
A|What have your other topics been?|qw
B|the other topic was, like I said, uh, something about politicians.|sd
B|I can't remember exactly what it was.|sd
B|It was real general statement|sd
A|I had one that I hated.|sd
A|It was what meal would you cook for, uh, uh special dinner|sd
B|Gee whiz|ba
B|yeah.|%
A|How far can you go with that one,|qh
A|right.|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Another one, though, that was good was, uh, what do you think about the social changes for the last ten, twenty and thirty years|sd
A|and what do you think has caused some of the social problems.|^q
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|that would be neat.|sv
B|I'd have to basically say my birth. *humor|sd
A|That's probably the best one.|sv
A|And we had to talk about air pollution too.|sd
A|What do you think is causing it|^q
A|and what should we do about it?|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries, I mean other parts of the state, you know,|sv
B|of course Pittsburgh, would say, you know, oh, find the better cheaper ways of burning coal, you know.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|Cleaner ways of burning coal|^q
B|and people in the South would say don't burn coal, you know.|sv
A|Because we don't have much coal.|^2
B|Oh we have a lot of coal|ar
A|In Virginia.|sd
B|But, uh, it's, uh, it's a dirty fuel, that's for sure.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well how did you get into this program.|qw
B|Excuse me. How did I get into it, oh,|b
B|I'm an electrical engineer here in Virginia.|sd
A|For T I.|qy^d
B|No.|nn
A|No.|b^m
B|Uh, no,|nn
B|they,|%
B|I'm in a telecommunications company|sd

B|Um, not really,|ng
B|I mean no more than any other company, you know,|sd
B|we buy their parts just as much as anybody else.|sd
B|But, uh, no, no real association with T I other than being in the same industry, electronics industry.|sd
A|Huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|%
B|They just, uh, they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying, that you know, if you're interested we're doing a study|sd

B|I don't know,|no
B|no|nn

B|Oh.|b
A|And I just signed up for it.|sd
B|Oh, oh, that's a neat idea.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|well he's gotten a good mix.|sd
B|I was saying because I've,|sd
B|like I said, I heard some other people talking that they've talked to different people in different states and stuff.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number|sv

A|Well, I think it's a very, very complicated,|sv
B|Huh.|b
A|and  I sort of, I see perspectives on all sides.|sd
A|Um, and I've have no hope for solutions.|sd
A|But, uh, I do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue.|sd
A|I have worked with, uh, uh, a little bit with refugees from,  Southeast  Asia, uh, who've come over. Uh, you know, to escape the genocide programs that are over there.|sd
A|And seen, you know, heard about some of the problems that they've had.|sd
A|And I'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be.|sd
A|Because I, in general, like a smaller rather than a larger population, to the land area.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I'm in California,  which  has a lot of immigration. Probably more than any where else in the country, though I'm not sure if that's the case.|sd

A|I, I don't either.|sd
A|It's a really delicate, uh, moral, issue.|sv
A|Because, if you have, well,|%
A|I guess the one thing I do see that is, is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, I do feel you have a certain obligation to,  to get them on their  feet.|sd
B|To get them on their,|^2
B|Yeah.|b
A|Because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in|sv
A|and you're, you're dooming them to being underclass people.|sv
B|Right,|b
A|You know, you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever.|sv
A|And I know that, that the Southeast Asians, the Hmong people that I've done some work with, uh, feel very quite hurt and, and unsure of themselves when here.|sd
A|Because they're coming from, you know, from the slash and burn intercultural society, you know,|sd
A|they're coming from the middle ages, basically.|sd
A|And they're being plunked down, plunked down into America.|sd
A|Many of them had been promised by the C I A, during the war over there, that because they co-operated with the C I A, and they helped the C I A out, that when they came here, the C I A would help establish them in America,|sd
A|and the C I A, of course, isn't doing that.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|And, uh, so they come here|sd
A|and they don't know what the heck they're doing.|sd
A|And they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities.|sd
A|And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would do, like nothing better than to take advantage of them.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they're, they're incredible victims of crime.|sd
A|And part of it is this lack of,  lack  of basic information, being dissimilated .|sd
A|And I'm not saying it's easy to do,|sd
A|and I know there are a few people who are trying,|sd
A|but, but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.|sd
B|And there's a lot of graft, like people trying to tell them, oh, giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.|sd
A|Uh, yeah,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I  mean, these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Um, and it's,|%
A|it's,|%
A|I, I couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until I, until I met with them.|sd
A|And I realized that, they, some of the information that I just, you know, don't even realize and know is information, they don't have.|sd
A|And I never thought, well, I guess that is something you need to know, you know.|sd
A|People getting into trouble because they come here,|sd
A|and so they start farming on, uh, available land, you know. Like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it.|sd
A|But then someone comes along and says you can't do that, you know.|sd
A|Why can't they?|qh
A|They have no idea why not, some, some of them, you know.|sd
A|The ones that have been here longer and have been in, you know, understand now.|sd
A|But when they initially come over,|sd
B|You mean, really trying to plant something?|qy
B|That's what you're saying?|br
A|Yeah,|ny
B|Farming?|qy
A|'cause they're farmers.|sd
A|These,  are  all farmers coming over,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and they're being put in the middle of the city|sd
B|Oh that's terrible.|ba
A|I mean they're nomadic farmers, you know,|sd
A|they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|These are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. You know, these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war.|sd
A|And, uh, they have, you know.|%
A|So I, I, I do have a lot of sympathy for them,|sd
A|and I feel that America could try a little bit harder to, to help people adjusting to the American way.|sd
A|Because if they don't, you're just going to produce, you know, you're going to produce an underclass, you know.|sv
A|You're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks, being sort of led out of slavery|sv
A|and then, then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then.|sd
A|And there was no,  real up, upward movement.|sd
B|And not being cared for.|bf
A|And,  not being, you know,|%
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|aa
A|Um,|%
B|Well, what did you do when you helped these people?|qw
A|Well,|%
B|How did you, what did you do,|qw
A|I, I wasn't helping them.|sd
A|I worked with  them, not to help them, but for my own purposes.|sd
A|I'm, I'm a linguist|sd
A|and I was, uh, doing a language, trying to learn their language, a little bit.|sd
A|And I actually, um, I mean, helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me.|sd
A|But I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.|sd
B|All right.|bk
A|I do have friends who have tried to do more,  social work,   you  know, by explaining to people how the language,  and  what the problems learning English might be and such.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers.|sd
A|And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.|sd
B|Well, I'm an E S L teacher.|sd
A|Oh, you are?|bh
B|Yes.|ny
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well you,|%
B|I got my certification.|sd
B|But actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language|sd
A|That's, that's been my impression.|sd
B|I mean, it's like people don't know,  what they say,|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|It's, it's  not, they're not withholding information,|sd
B|it's not step for step.|sd
A|they just don't have that information.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|They, they haven't the foggiest idea.|sd
B|But anyway, I enjoy it.|sd
B|They,  they,|%
B|the kids I've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And|%
A|And Spanish is,  pretty close to English, really.|sv
B|but I'm applying  for,|sd
B|What?|br
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it is.|sv
A|And Spanish is a lot like English.|sv
B|A lot of our words are the same,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|like,  you know,  they just  change the pronunciation a little bit.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, I love it.|sd
B|I love the culture, uh, the way that they, uh, they respect education and their teachers their parents, so much more than, than my children do. You know,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and I like it.|sd
B|And what I've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this, uh, Asian center that, a Doctor Falk has started, that works with the school district.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And doing what, trying to get them set up, inculturated,  into  the system.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I  thought that would be good experience for me.|sd
A|Oh, I'm sure it would.|sv
B|And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And I think that would be wonderful too.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it would be a good experience,|sv
A|and you'd be helping people, I'm sure.|sv
A|Very much.|sv
A|And and I mean, not to put, not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but I do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble.|sd
A|I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|They became a very successful immigrant group.|sv
A|But, and, but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam, right now, coming from worn torn countries, are, are not having the same success.|sv
A|I think some people have just assumed, well, why, why can't you be successful?|sv
A|The Japanese were, or the Chinese were, or something.|^q
A|And it's really much more complicated.|sv
B|Well, the times were different too.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|the times are different, yeah.|b^m
B|My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish.|sd
B|And he's going through the, I don't know, the Jewish League or something. And helping a family that's come over from Russia.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And he spends,|sd
B|well, right now, he's down to like once a week,|sd
B|but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,  and  help them with the language.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he thoroughly enjoyed it.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|I, I think it's a wonderful thing to do.|sv
A|And there's a lot, there's a lot more,|sv
A|I guess another possible solution is, since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and, and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it, uh,  more  of the volunteer network service.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|Because everyone gains from it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Would be,|%
A|would,|%
A|might be really useful.|sv
A|Uh, and if it's, you know, uh, just people helping people I think makes, makes the community so much happier.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|What's so sad about this is both of the, the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers|sd
B|but,  their  training isn't what we need in this country.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yes.|b
B|And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|I've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country. I mean,|sd
A|and they're highly educated people,|sd
A|but of course, if you're educated and you don't speak English, no one thinks anything of you.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|no.|aa
B|And this woman was, uh, stocking the shelves in a drugstore.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|I feel sorry for her.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I do too.|sd
A|Well, It's been good talking with you.|fc
B|Well, thank you.|ft
A|Uh, okay.|fc
B|Have a good night.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|it does sound like you have some children to take care of|sd
B|Okay.|aa
B|Yes,|aa
B|I do|sd
A|Uh, Okay,|b
A|bye-bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fc
B|Bye.|fc
A|I just pressed my, uh.|sd
B|We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.|sd
A|I got one that's interesting, not too, not too controversial,|sd
A|I,|%
A|you know, not,|%
A|doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.|sd
A|I, I do get somewhat of a kick out of,|sd
A|because Schwartzkopf, or the other generals, who I admire, how everyone wants to make, get them in politics.|sv
A|I think that's kind of an interesting recent thing, that I could think of recently that, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I was wondering what you thought about that making the general, uh, getting a general into politics.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Well, I've, I've been thinking about it,|sd
A|and I, uh, I kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero,|sd
A|those,|%
A|we're looking for a hero.|sv
A|Well, TIME magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents,|sd
A|and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They are much more educated than the average corporate president,|sd
A|and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a, a very much better education than the average, uh, corporate president.|sd
A|So, I thought well, maybe.|sd
B|I, I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.|sv
A|Well, that, too,|aa
A|that, too.|aa
A|And, uh, you know, they talk about the Army|sd
A|and because of the war|sd
A|and why did we win, and all that,|sd
A|and they talked about how the training was so important.|sd
A|And that's so important in industry,|sd
A|so, you know, they're liable to be right. That generals, generals in the service,|sv
A|and Schwartzkopf, uh, you know, might make a good, uh, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.|sv
B|He, he, you know, we know he's a good leader,|sv
B|we know he's a good organizer.|sv
B|The question is, you know, can he be the man who's ultimately responsible.|sd
B|You know, like what he said is, you know, a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about, you know, people asking why are you doing this, why are you doing that.|sd
B|He says, I'm following the orders of my president.|sd
B|I'm not the one who writes the orders.|^q
B|I'm just the one who follows them.|^q
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs, you know,|sv
A|everyone has a boss, of course.|sv
B|You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.|sd
B|But he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, you, you pick one.|ad
A|I just thought of that one when, when they brought up about politics.|sd
A|That was, uh, pretty easy|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican,|ad
A|you can pick anything you want,|ad
A|go ahead.|ad
B|Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.|sd
B|How do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long,|qh
B|how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again.|qh
A|Well, I have an easy answer for that, oh, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, whether that's two five year terms or whatever.|sv
B|I|%
B|yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That may be our only answer,|sv
B|but I don't really like it.|sd
B|I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve.|sd
A|Oh, you know, you're not.|ar
B|I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat,|sd
B|I think if the President can prove that he's popular, you know, that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.|sv
B|I mean, how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year, did they get after they were elected, just, you know, just after they were elected two years ago.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|Basically the people,|sv
B|as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, Yeah, yeah, you're my friend,|sv
B|you're my friend,|^q
B|and two years later he remembers that.|sv
B|And what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|I do like the limitation of the President,|sd
A|and I think there is a needed change.|sv
A|I think the same thing should happen for Congress.|sv
A|I, I'd you know,|%
A|that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well.|%
A|My God, it's ridiculous, you know.|sv
B|That's, that's the easy way.|sv
B|I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground|sv
A|We had.|%
B|That's what the financing rules and the, uh, the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff.|sv
A|I think voting is, is a I think I had one of the subject about voting, and, uh, voting apathy, or something like that,|sd
A|and I think that, uh, the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time.|sv
A|I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course they have absentee which is getting to be more, a lot easier,|sd
A|and I, I vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now.|sd
A|But, I think, gee whiz, you could make it a couple days.|sv
A|It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|You know, like, you know, the, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.|sv
A|Are you in Dallas?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I'm in Dallas city limit.|sd
A|Boy, I, I, I live in Arlington.|sd
A|I am so happy not to be part of Dallas when I see those folks there.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It's an ugly mess.|sv
A|I mean, I don't know if you like the mayor,|sd
A|but I think your mayor,|sv
A|the city council,|sv
A|the,|%
A|what is the woman's name whose, us, not the mayor but the, *typo should be who's|qw
B|The manager.|^2
A|Yeah,|aa
A|the city manager.|sd
A|All of them need to be thrown out.|sv
A|I mean, they're just awful, just awful.|sv
B|Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|And if it, if it had passed,|sv
B|if these people had gotten out the vote, it would have passed|sv
B|and there'd be no more argument.|sv
B|But they're still fighting about it because of the way the election went last December.|sv
A|I know.|aa
A|It's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money. That we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants,|sv
A|and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.|sv
B|But, but this is for, supposedly to benefit the minorities,|sd
B|and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote|sv
A|Well you're right there.|aa
B|and they would have had their way.|sv
A|You're right there.|aa
A|Uh, uh, people are,|%
A|uh, uh, politics, uh,|%
A|the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's pretty sad.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|sv
A|Uh, hopefully people will get more involved.|sd
B|My, my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|but those are the ones that are complaining, I, I think, a lot.|sv
A|I see it here at T I.|sd
A|The guys that don't take any interest in, and, and constantly on the negative of everything.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, Is that right? Ooh.|bh
B|And, and you ask them why they don't vote,|sd
B|they say well they don't want their name on the, uh, jury duty list.|sd
B|That, that's where they get the jury duty list, is from the voter registration.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|you're right,|aa
A|you're right.|aa
A|I think they could do more about, uh, voting.|sv
B|I think they could.|sv
A|What are the issues?|qw
A|I, I'm a Democrat,|sd
A|I want to just say that I'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat.|sd
A|I don't even know,|h
A|I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I mean, at least I'd like to see|sd
A|because I like competition, you know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead,|sv
A|I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party,|sd
A|I can not believe it, you know. *typo cannot|sd
B|In Presidential races that's about what they've done,|sv
B|but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I still think in the last ten years,|sv
A|you know, of course that's not a recent event,|sd
A|that's only my opinion,|h
A|I guess I really shouldn't talk about that.|h
A|But, I don't know whether they're recent events.|sd
A|I guess they on this, uh, speech thing, they want us to use a variety of words.|sd
B|Right.|aa
A|How many times have you called, by the way?|qy
B|Actually, I haven't made any calls,|sd
B|but I received about a dozen.|sd
A|Oh, really, I, I, I,|b
B|I think, yeah, I have to make these,|sd
B|but I get distracted and get to do something else,|sd
B|and all of a sudden my phone rings,|sd
B|and go, Well, what the heck, we'll talk for a while.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I've already got twelve cards.|sd
A|You get any cards in the mail?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we got a whole bunch.|sd
B|I can't remember how many.|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|I'm amazed by,|sd
A|of course, we're not talking about politics,|sd
A|but I am amazed by,|sd
A|people say they got thirty.|sd
A|Well, I wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice,|sd
A|but I'm not in voice synthesis.|sd
A|But I'd sure like to see a summary of it.|sd
A|We'll get to politics, I'm sorry|sd
B|Well, I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|We're supposed to do five minutes,|sd
B|and that was three minutes ago.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Hey, well thanks for the call.|ft
A|Yeah,|fc
A|bye-bye.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|bye.|fc
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what are your favorite things to watch?|qy
B|Oh, uh, let's see,|^h
B|I, uh, I have enjoyed, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING in the past, uh, now that it has gone off|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but,  what, what are your,|qw
B|what is,|qw
A|We do not watch a lot of T V,|sd
A|we try to watch it on Thursday nights,|sd
A|we usually watch L A LAW,|sd
A|I like that real well. And CHEERS|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|we like to watch that.|sd
A|Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW.|sd
A|Uh, do you ever watch that?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|uh, yeah,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|we, we we try to catch that most, most nights.|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons.|sd
A|I was sort of sorry to see it go too.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it.|sd
B|I, I really did not think it, it was,  that  way.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it presented.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I thought a lot of the,|sd
A|like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Just the dynamics of it and everything.|sd
B|Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,|sv
B|but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as,  as examples  of things that were going on|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
B|and, and uh, you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and  that sort of thing|sd
B|Uh, we kind of,|%
B|uh, our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along,|sd
B|so, uh,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that,  that tends to, uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, uh, it's, uh, very little T V time left.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you are too tired to do anything.|bf
B|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|Probably more worthwhile.|sv
A|I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|I, I can not, uh, *typo? cannot?|sd
B|I don't think there were, Uh,|sv
B|I have not, I have not, uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to|sd
B|I, uh, you know,|%
B|I, uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch,|sd
B|but, uh, I uh, you know very seldom like to watch you know those,|sd
B|there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.|sd
B|I like, uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|it's, I  notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,|sd
B|yeah|%
B|but it's, uh, it's on|%
B|instead of being on P B S it's on regular T V.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|But, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house|sd
B|and,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I have seen parts of that before,|sd
A|it is interesting.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa

A|we are like that|sd

A|But, uh,  you  can not take a whole lot of that either,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|it's pretty slow.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's kind of like,  like  baseball|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Do you|%
A|we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just,  on  Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on|sd
A|and,|%
B|Right.|aa
B|I think that that's what more people are doing|sv
B|and I think that's, you know,|sv
B|as, as T V,|%

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I  know we, we have done that too in the past, uh,|sd
B|we do not do it quite as much now, cause our baby will not let us watch them.|sd

A|It does improve the reception a little bit though,|sd
A|that's the only thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I have, I put some, put in some, uh, an antenna, a really good antenna|sd

B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's probably a major one.|sv

A|yes.|aa
B|Yeah,|b

B|But, um, I think another,|sv
B|you can tell when you go around cities, you can smell specific things from, from, specific industries.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|sd
B|I remember being,|sd
B|I, I grew up in New Jersey|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|sure.|b
B|And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I know, uh, uh, in Michigan, uh, the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it,|sd
A|and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.|sd

A|No,|aa
A|and when they,|%
A|and you bury it|sd

B|Then it just gets into the soil and into the water|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and they're, and they're destroying us,|sv
A|they, really are.|sv

B|We really have to do more,|sv

B|I think we've got to do more with the recycling.|sv
B|That's,|%
B|I'm, I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|but there's not enough.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we need expert cooperation.|sv
B|Well, it's a,|%
B|we're getting,|%
B|at least they're starting,  you know.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Education of the, Education of the people is primary, I would think.|sv
B|So at least they're moving that direction.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, and we're hard to teach.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well,|%
A|We are hard to teach.|sv
B|it's going to, it's probably going to be a generation or two before, before it's really going, very well, because now the adults are more aware of it,|sv
A|Absolutely,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the children are being taught in the schools more, it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.|sv
A|Absolutely,|aa
A|yes.|aa
A|Uh, of course, uh, we would like to see it accelerated because, uh, of the critical nature of it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|The, the learning of it and the,|sv
A|just to, um, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, um, motivate ourselves to, um, uh, do what is right for the atmosphere.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I think we're all contributors.|sv
A|I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor, to pollution,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, we just um.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think you're right,|aa
B|education is a big thing you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that, that are causing problems|sv
B|and, and I think that they'll they'll work towards solving those problems more too. Um,|sv
A|Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past. That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our, and our, um, land, you know, which, uh, we get our nutrients from.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I mean, everything goes back to the land.|sv
B|Just a minute and I'll turn it up.|t3
B|I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done.|t3
A|So um, it's just, um, very critical, I think at this point to, uh, get that through to the people and get us educated.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um,|%
A|I, I don't know if they offer classes in, uh, the, uh, in the grade school, uh, uh,  subjecting.|sd
B|I think they teach  it a lot in science|sd
A|In science,|b^m
A|okay.|bk
B|Yeah.|b
B|I would think that that's where it would come through.|sd
A|What grade level would that be?|qw
A|Would that be, um, perhaps, the first grade level, which would be,|qy
B|I, I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades.|sd
A|Well, I mean, are they starting, though, at, at, with the children that are so,|qy
A|their little minds are like sponges|sv
A|and they can really uh, relate to that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think they are starting probably in the first grade.|sd
B|They're, you know, they're hearing somewhat about it.|sd
B|Um, I know, uh, Target has their program to make kids more aware of it|sd
B|and,|%
A|Target stores?|br

B|They've got, if you go in the entrance, they've got, uh, stands usually where they have, um, little, uh, kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read|sd
A|Okay.|b
B|and and they can form a, a group to, um,|sd
A|Oh, I see.|bk
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|help fight the pollution.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
B|So,|%
A|Well, I'm sure that, uh, perhaps they're the leaders, you know,|sv
A|and other will, others will pick up on their example and carry it, uh, further.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, because, uh, thoughts are,|sv
B|Well, I, I know it's it's a hard problem to solve because you, you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,|sd
B|and then there's the paper and plastic bag question.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn

B|right?|^g
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|Um, MADAM BUTTERFLY was, um, in Dallas,|sd
A|it's been two or three years ago now,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It was particularly well,|sd
A|the acting was particularly nice, I thought,|sd

B|Yeah.|b
A|Um, you don't play, um, an instrument|sd
A|so, uh, um, have you ever wanted to, like guitar or piano or|qy
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa

A|I think piano is always good background,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|beginner.|%
A|Um, I played piano all through, well, I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college,|sd
A|and, uh, then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school,|sd
A|so, um, that was the instrument both of my children started on,|sd
A|but neither of them stayed with it|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|One of them, um, turned into a violist,|sd
A|and the other one is, the boy is, um, guitar and, and percussion,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|It may be country,|sd
A|it might be classical,|sd
A|it might be rock, you know|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Um, do you have any plans to, uh, do anything with your music in the near future|qy

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I, I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree|sd
B|or,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|um|%
A|I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing,|sd
A|I'm not sure where, you are in Texas,|sd
A|but I do know that some communities have, uh, community choruses|sd
A|and, uh, that's often a good way to get back into it again.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's not terribly demanding.|sv
A|You might have to audition,|sd
A|but that probably wouldn't be a problem,|sv
A|but, um, there usually, you know,|sd
A|that they take tours and things like that|sd
A|and you get to know you know, people socially as well as, as in a musical setting,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so that's always fun.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's, well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music,|sd
A|but we've gotten to know each other quite well, um, in, on a, a social level,|sd
A|and, and I think we sing better because of that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think, you know, I think we sing more like, uh, people who trust each other which is really nice.|sd
B|That's good.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b

A|It was funny, um, uh,|sd
A|it's, you know,|%
A|I talk to people all over, uh, Texas, um, and only one person outside of the uh, of the state,|sd

A|Um, are, do you have a family?|qy

B|Yeah,|ny
B|I think so.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|That often is the case, um,|sv
A|the, you know,|%
A|it's, it, sometimes it will skip.|sv
A|Like my husband is not musical at all,|sd
A|but his mother is very musical,|sd
A|and, um, and his children are very musical,|sd
A|so you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.|sv
A|So, um, well, I'm not sure how long we've talked.|sd
B|I think,|%
A|I haven't paid, haven't been paying attention to the, to the clock.|sd
A|But, uh, I'll bet we've done, we've done at least five minutes.|sd

B|All right,|fc
B|thanks.|ft
A|Uh-huh.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?|qo
B|I think in some professions it's, uh, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, uh, train conductors uh, on drugs.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently,|sd
A|and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana,|sd
A|I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay|sd
B|Oh, my goodness,|ba
A|and it would,|%
A|that would, tied up traffic for a long time,|sd
A|everybody died,|sd
A|the fire was terrible,|sd
A|it was awful.|sd
A|So, yeah,|%
A|I think you're right,|sv
A|I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field,|sv
A|but then you know, who would test all truck drivers you know,|qh
B|They,|%
B|that's, that is a problem|sv
B|and every time before they get into a vehicle I mean.|qh
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know,|h
A|even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that make sense?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|uh, it may make a difference for some of them because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh career.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and then, uh, I think,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh|b
A|I don't, I don't know.|h
B|however, here in Dallas uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,|sd
B|and was to the point, he was on probation,|sd
B|he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract,|sd
B|and they wouldn't have to pay him,|sd
B|and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him,|sd
B|but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice|sd
B|and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem|sd
B|and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
B|so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.|sd
A|Get rid of him.|^2
A|Right,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,|sd
B|he's been in the paper, in jail,|sd
B|and it's just been awful|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and talk about a terrible role model,|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible you know,|sv
A|it's really funny though, um,|sv
A|I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school|sd
B|Um.|%
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school|sd
A|and a friend came and got me,|sd
A|and I was there,|sd
A|and I could smell the dope,|sd
A|and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and nothing ever happened,|sd
A|and from from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever,|sd
B|Oh, that's terrible.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I really, uh,|%
A|I'm so anti drunk driving,|sd
A|and, and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on the subject.|sd
B|I think most of us are.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|but as I've, as soon as that happened,|sd
A|I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|if you know someone,|sv
B|for example we have, uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,|sd
B|and, uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school|sd
A|Right.|b
B|he went through surgery after surgery|sd
A|Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff.|sd
B|and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.|sd
B|And he,|%
B|as far as his athletics, he's lost all of that.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|He, uh, has been tutored,|sd
B|and he'll catch up in school and everything,|sd
B|but, he's still not back where he was.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I don't think somebody,|sv
B|He may never have  all those motor skills back.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life.|sd
A|You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.|sv
B|Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.|sd
B|Well, he, the train missed him,|sd
B|but, uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|he was in a coma for four months,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he's out of the coma now,|sd
B|and eventually they think he will come back,|sd
B|but you don't know that,|sd
B|and|%
A|Right.|b
B|but he's lost,|sd
B|he was an outstanding football player,|sd
A|So, what kind of a house do you live in?|qw
B|I'm in a, uh, in a ranch.|sd
B|A, uh,|%
B|it was about, uh, sixteen hundred square feet when I bought it,|sd
B|and, uh, it's about two thousand square feet now,|sd
B|but it's one of those typical, uh, ranches that you find around here.|sd
B|Oh, it's, uh, built in the, probably built in the late fifties|sd
B|so it's not, um, what you would find, uh, where you live.|sd
B|But, uh, for the older, uh, ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, our home is, uh, probably, for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here.|sd
A|Uh, most of the, the homes that they're building,|sd
A|well, I shouldn't say all of them,|h
A|but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Oh yeah,|ny
A|there's,|%
B|How many square feet do you have?|qw
A|We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.|sd
B|Four bedrooms?|qy
A|Uh, we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.|sd
B|Five bedrooms.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|A, a bedroom for my mother,|sd
A|and, uh,|%
B|I made a, I made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a, uh, what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house|sd
A|Oh, that's great.|ba
B|so that,|%
A|Well, this, this house is very comfortable.|sd
A|We've got two living areas|sd
A|and that, that's the thing I probably like the most about it.|sd
B|How many stories?|qw
B|Just one?|qy
A|It's just one story.|sd
A|Yeah.|ny
A|It's a Fox and Jacobs home.|sd
B|How are they built?|qw
A|Um, we've been real happy with it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I've heard that,|sd
B|I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs.|sd
A|Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that.|h
A|They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight|sd
A|and this is under something|^q
A|but,|%
B|But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?|qy^d
A|No.|nn
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|No,|nn
A|we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.|sd
B|No cracked slab or anything like that?|qy^d
A|No.|nn
B|All right.|bk
A|We've been real lucky.|sd
A|So,|%
B|And is it, um, a natural gas and,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know what I miss though?|qh
B|Basements.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|ba
B|I I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I've heard a lot of people say that.|sd
A|That's for sure.|ba
A|Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood over the beams and things up in the attic|sd
A|and so that, has replaced it to some extent|sd
B|So you,|%
A|but certainly not,|sd
B|Can you stand up in it?|qy
A|Uh, in parts.|na
A|I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.|sd
B|So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.|qy^d
A|Yes.|ny
B|ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|we, uh, we've got, you know,|sd
A|I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.|sd
B|So, five bedrooms and two living, two family|bf
A|Two living areas.|b^m
A|We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that,|sd
A|you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house,|sd
A|but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have|sd
B|Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.|qh
A|I think that's true.|aa
B|You|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|Probably our family room is the, the biggest. Uh,|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Some people, I mean,|%
B|families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there,|sv
B|and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Strange.|sv
A|Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So|%
B|So you've been fairly happy with it.|bf
B|How long have you been in it?|qw
A|Seventeen years.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
B|Boy, it doesn't seem that long|sd
B|but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.|sd
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|Yours is a slab I assume.|qy^d
A|Yes,|ny
A|it is.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have done if it was slab.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.|sd
A|Well, that's interesting.|ba
B|But that's because it's so old.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build like that,|sd
B|and, uh,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway.|sd
A|That's his, that's his,|%
B|I know,|aa
B|he's not a handy,|sd

A|worst thing in life is to have to repair something.|sd
B|I, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it|sd

B|and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it|sd
A|Well, uh, that's great.|ba
A|We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit|sd

A|yeah,|b
A|I know where you, I know the area.|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|Right,|b
A|that's kind of on the other side of town,|sd

B|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Oh, they're, they're little ones|sd
A|Oh, well,  I've got one in college|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|By now.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Let's see, we're on government,  whether  we think it's honest  or can be.|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|Whether it is  possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not.|sd
A|What about you?|qo
B|I,  I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.|sv
A|I don't either.|aa
A|I, I think,|sv
A|uh, even if people have good intentions, I think uh, power corrupts or something to a certain extent,  you know.|sv
B|The  ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it seems like, uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions,|sv
A|but it's just so enticing,|sv
A|and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know|sv
B|I don't know  if,  there is enough money that you could pay them  just,  you know X amount of money to keep them honest.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I just, I just don't, uh,|sd
A|Right.|aa
A|I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions,|sv
A|you know what I mean?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Right.|aa
A|Little  bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, you know, bend the rules, use their power.|sv
A|So maybe it's just man's nature|sv
B|We had, uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and there were several counties, uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners|sd
B|and, I mean, it was to the point of not just losing their job, but going to jail.|sd
A|Oh, my word.|ba
A|Oh, wow.|ba
A|What were they doing  taking some,|qw
B|Oh, they were  taking kickbacks.|sd
A|Oh, no|ba
B|Yeah|b
A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|Just a little here, a little there.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|right|b
B|Major amount here, a major amount  there.|sd
A|Right|b
A|Oh.|%
B|But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.|sd
A|Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,|sd
A|but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records.|sd
A|In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained,|sd
A|but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, you know.|sd
A|Some of them weren't even in the same city.|sd
A|One of them had, had cancer and died|sd
A|and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.|sd
B|Uh, that's, that's small scale.|sv
B|I don't know, you know,|h
B|I really don't know what could be done.  Uh,|sd
A|I don't,  I don't either. Uh, to make it totally honest.|sd
A|Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, uh.|sv
A|However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you  know, the  the HUD mess or the S and L.|sv
B|That's  right.|aa
A|We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.|sv
B|The cover-ups and,|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|right.|aa
A|I think that, uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,|sv
A|and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,|sv
A|but,  uh,|%
B|I,  uh, I don't know.|h
B|I just, uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, uh, on the side that, that,  it seems that when they  get up there it's, it's what, if I vote your way, what it'll do for me  rather,  than this is the way my constituents want it.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|That's right,|aa

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|and this would be for the best for the nation overall.|sv
A|You're right,|aa
A|it's just a,|%
A|I don't know.|h
A|I guess that's where they stay in, uh, in,|sv
A|they try to stay in office.|sv
A|But they always please the money people too.|sv
A|They need money so much, because they're constantly having to  run,  for office again.|sv
B|run,|^2
A|And,|%
B|Maybe|arp_nd
B|and then you think, well, if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's true.|aa
A|Boy, it is a big problem,|sv
A|but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,|sv
A|don't you?|^g
B|I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.|sv
A|I know.|aa
A|It's really terrible.|sv

B|Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,|sd
B|and, uh, so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with|sd
B|uh, you know, I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, uh, population, in in twenty years it's going to be, you know, phenomenal.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|almost thirty, all over thirty percent, isn't it.|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
B|Uh, and, um, but I have been amazed|sd
B|and, and in talking with, uh, some of my fellow students, it looks as though, um, nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more|sd
B|and, uh, in twenty years. Uh, where a lot of students are hoping, uh, to work as an in the home type, uh, uh, approach, where, where the, uh, where there's, you know, the speech therapist, or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to, uh, work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the, the loved one to stay, you know, at home with the family members.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, it's, it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of, uh, of Alzheimer's and, and, uh, some of the more degenerative diseases to, uh, say, uh, uh, leave them, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely, uh|sd
A|They're captive.|sv
B|exactly.|aa
B|Yeah,|b
B|and, and did, did you experience that with your, with your father or not?|qy
A|Uh, we had a, at one stage we had care somewhat like, like what you're talking about.|sd
A|We had the Visiting Nurses program|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they sent somebody in,|sd
A|and it, it was a, a nominal charge that this, uh, it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|They would try to get him to exercise.|sd
A|They would try to, uh, you know,|sd
A|they would check him over to, to, you know, the basic checks.|sd
A|Try to get him to talk and be motivated|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, that's what we went through.|sd
A|Uh, up to a point things seemed to be working,|sd
A|and then, uh, I think, he, he became discouraged|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and they did not know how to take care of that,|sd
A|and then, um, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.|sv
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, but, yes,|aa
A|I agree there's a lot of options.|sd
A|There could be a lot of options.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think it's time that, uh, we decide to do something about it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Um.|%
B|Definitely.|aa
B|You know, one of the other subjects on the switchboard, and this is one that I've been thinking applies here, uh, where, where, uh, young, young kids, uh, graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work.|sd
B|This would be an excellent example of some where, uh, some place where, um, the community could be more involved, you know, more than just leaving it only to professionals.|sv
B|There is a lot the community, the community can do to, uh, enhance the, or, or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home.|sv
A|I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.|sd
B|Possibly before.|sv
B|I don't know now.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|the church or synagogue, whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even in most, even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.|sv
B|Huh-uh.|aa
A|Uh, the mobility factor, the factor that, uh, oh, we're living longer and people are less trusting, all these things tend to destroy this type of system.|sv
A|But I agree with you,|sd
A|there might be some possibilities there.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.|sv
B|I agree.|aa
B|That's a, that's a good point.|sv
A|I think they would have to have some training.|sv
A|All righty.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, I guess our topic today is air pollution.|sd
A|And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.|sd
B|Right.|aa
A|Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these lines?|qy
B|Me, I'm in the legal department|sd
B|and, um, we do have, uh, a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.|sd
B|I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground, you know, we're coming up with a, uh, a new solution.|sd
B|We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump|sd
B|and we just transport to these places.|sd
B|But after awhile it always seems that the, um, oh, the site starts to leak|sd
B|and then you have to clean it up and such.|sd
B|But the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman,|sd
B|and we're going have that, you know, incineration place up there and, dump everything there.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, in, you know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.|sd
B|And that we won't be polluting the air.|sd
B|I'm sure we have to have, uh, permits, you know, for that place. And that there's, you know, limits as to what we can, uh, let, you know, go into the air.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|It's, uh, uh, uh, well,|%
A|I work in , I work in environmentals, uh, projects right now.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|And so the Sherman deal is, um, uh, lost a lot of hair over that project.|sd
B|Oh|b
A|Uh, what we run into, um, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, uh, jurisdictions under which we have to, uh, uh, reply to.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear, so we have our manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B, which is located in Austin, in writing|sd
A|and, hey,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|look what we've done here at T I.|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, we are presently, uh, in receipt of a site permit, which will allow us to, um, uh,|sd
A|this is our side allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's in, in, in tons per year. Um,|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|and so, you know, what we do to make contributions so that, basically, we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, uh, that, uh, scrub out the, N O X and, uh, V O C's and, and ammonia compounds, uh, like all the acids, to a certain level.|sd
A|We, are very, um, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.|sd
A|And so what we go through is, uh, if you see it smoking there's a problem.|sd
A|And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking|sd
A|and you have to get it fixed el pronto.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|As you know, they, they're allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime they want, drive through, and see, and inspect.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|So it's a full time, uh, everybody has their home phone number type of job. Um,|sd
B|Now is that place built|qy
B|or you're still on the makings of it?|qrr
A|The Sherman facility, we are still in the, closer too, but still have a little bit of, um, finalization to do.|sd
A|Right.|%
A|It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, um, open arms, as well as the public.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We had open forum|sd
A|and, and, uh, uh, Tom Jones, our environmental, corporate environmental guys handle the project.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, its real, uh, going real well.|sd
A|I think it's matter, just a matter of fund, funds right now as I understand it. Uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it's, uh, it's something else.|sd
A|Yeah.|%
A|they're, they're, they're in the same issue.|sd
A|We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.|sd
A|Uh, because the, the system is setup where it won't have any emissions.|sd
A|You're correct.|sd
A|It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was, it was human nature.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But it won't have can any, uh, any bad stuff.|sd
A|So, uh, I think T I, we spend, of all the major semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost, foremost, uh, uh, first thing we always look at.|sd
A|And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.|sd
A|We eat and sleep the stuff, everything we do over here.|sd
A|and, uh, it's an interesting job.|sd
A|But um,|%
B|Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, uh, quite a list of cites that have gone bad|sd
B|and you have to clean up.|sd
B|And, you know the law now is the super fund|sd
B|and anybody who's contributed toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, you know, uh, damaged the ground or not.|sd
B|Uh, everybody has to contribute|sd
B|and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten, uh, gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and, you know, mega bucks to, uh, you know take everything out and redo it and, you know, fill in some other area|sd
B|and, um, certainly, it would to have a better solution, like the Sherman facility than, um, just letting it go in the ground.|sd
B|Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined, uh, dump area.|sd
B|It still only in time starts to leak out.|sd
A|Possibly.|aap_am
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|There, there was one site that they cleaned up|sd
B|and then the new place leaked again. .|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I'm familiar with that one.|sd
A|We have, we have stuff that's very interesting, uh,|sd
A|we have hoods,|sd
A|we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, um, they have, um, that we sample|sd
B|Uh-huh.|sd
A|and it may have over, uh, a certain emission levels,|sd
A|this is on the solid side ,|sd
A|and so we take it|sd
A|and, uh, we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid.|sd
A|And we mix it with concrete and actually, um, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it in the ground. But not so, not in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|%
A|It was totally legal.|sd
A|But the cost of doing this is astronomical, they actually show you what duckwork and things.|sd
B|Um,|%
A|And so we were, uh, very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh, expenditures because it could get very expensive.|sd
A|But I think we, uh, you know, we do all kinds of things to make the, the world a better place to live, you know,|sd
A|I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.|sd
A|I really would.|sd
A|Um, I've enjoyed speaking with you,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|This has been an interesting topic.|sv
A|Uh, I was one of the,|sd
A|I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building|sd
B|Oh, you were?|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|So, uh, I hope you like your office.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yes.|aa
B|Yes.|aa
B|It's a heck of a lot different.|sd
B|And we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk.|sd
B|We were about the only, place in, you know, T I that had the gray metal desk.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Glad to see y'all taken care of.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, the, uh, I think what changed everything and, uh, is, uh, y'all were, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years,|sv
B|We, finally got a little respect.|sd
B|Nobody thought of us as a profit center before.|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
A|And that's, um, when, when you start, when you start paying your way, uh, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
A|I was just,|%
B|Not just overhead.|sv
A|Exactly.|aa
A|I've enjoyed speaking with you.|fc
B|You too.|fc
A|See you later.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|make sure it's nice and brown on both sides|ad
B|and then you take it out of the fat|ad
B|and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan|ad
B|and you kind of clean it out|ad
B|and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.|ad
B|Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.|ad
B|And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.|ad
B|Stir it real, real well.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.|ad
B|And you let it come to a boil again|ad
B|and then you let it simmer|ad
B|and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.|ad
A|Oh.|b
B|And that's going to, it's going to be really good|sv
A|That's very spicy, too.|bf
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's,|%
A|I mean these bell peppers and curry.|bf
B|Right,|aa
B|and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Oh, that sounds really good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Huh.|b
A|I guess it was,|sd
A|is this dinner time for you?|qy
B|Uh, well it will be in a little while,|na
B|I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.|sd
A|All done in advance,|bf
A|yeah.|b
A|That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook|sd
A|but I was single until I was thirty|sd
A|so I did cook a little, you know.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, and I cook a little bit now.|sd
A|What I like to do mostly is stir fries|sd
A|and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight|sd
A|and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.|sd
B|What kind of wok do you have,|qw
B|is it, is it a real Chinese wok.|qy
A|It's, it's called a stir fry pan|sd
A|and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric|sd
A|so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I see.|b
A|And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.|sd
A|But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.|sd
A|And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.|sd
A|That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor|sd
A|and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I've used,|%
A|you turn them over.|sd
A|A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,|sd
A|we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,|sd
A|so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.|sd
B|Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,|sv
A|It's, it's a pretty big|sd
A|and we put that over rice.|sd
B|I just don't like squash.|sd
A|Oh, you don't|bf
B|I never did.|sd
B|My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash|sd
B|and she'd have squash and corn bread|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'd just be,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.|sd
A|My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.|sd
A|I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh|sd
A|and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Red meat and a potato.|sd
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba
B|We, we were from North Carolina|sd
B|and we had a garden|sd
B|and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash|sd
B|and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,|sd
A|Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.|bf
B|Right.|aa
A|See, never, no vegetables in my family.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|it was really funny.|sd
B|You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens|sd
A|Well that was a real farm.|bf
B|You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,|sd
A|I've heard stories.|sd
B|And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub|sd
B|and finally it dies down,|sd
B|you get just a little patter|sd
B|and then it,|sd
A|Oh, this is|sv
A|you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.|ad
B|Getting ready to eat chicken too.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|you should be careful|ad
A|That's pretty funny.|sv
A|But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens|sd
A|but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,|sd
A|we, we bought everything in a grocery store.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|There was no,|sd
A|but it was funny, you know,|sd
A|it so,|%
A|but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.|sd
B|Well that's good.|ba
B|A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.|sv
A|I think so too,|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|but we just went shopping|sd
A|and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts|sd
A|and uh, we came back with sweets.|sd
B|Ugh.|ba
A|We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian|sd
A|and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office|sd
A|and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.|sd
B|Ugh.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that was a sweet|sd
A|and I was like ugh.|sd
A|This is a sweet.|^q
A|Oh it is, it's a candy,|^q
A|I'm like ugh, you know,|sd
A|Indian candy is not very good.|^q
B|Uh, right.|aa
A|But everything was, and everything,|sd
A|you didn't notice it at first,|sd
A|but everything was sort of hot.|sd
A|Everything had a little bit of curry in it.|sd
B|The spice,|bf
B|yeah.|b
A|It was funny, even the sweets did.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it|sd
A|but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.|sd
A|You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Good,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|they didn't have,|sd
A|I didn't like her desserts very well,|sd
A|they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it wasn't very good.|sd
B|Well I might have liked some of that|sd
B|I, I like hot stuff,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I really do.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well have we done our ten minutes.|sd
B|Oh is it ten minutes.|qy
A|Something like that,|na
A|I think we're,|sd
B|I don't know,|h
B|do we get a signal.|qy
A|No,|nn
A|normally they just come in|sd
A|and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.|sd
B|Oh, well this is my first one.|sd
A|Oh, okay|bk
A|well that's,|%
A|you'll see it will normally, it will come on|sd
A|and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to fifteen seconds to complete it.|sd
B|Oh wow.|ba
A|But, uh, I've been cut off twice.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So I just thought,|sd
A|in fact I'm just also,|sd
A|I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,|sd
A|he has one of those alarms on his car,|sd
B|Goodness.|ba
A|one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car|sd
A|and it's going off.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.|sd
B|Well, okay.|bk
A|Okay,|b
A|hey thanks so much.|ft
B|Yeah,|fc
B|thank you,|ft
B|it was nice talking with you.|fc
A|Uh-huh,|fc
A|and you said this was your|bf
A|well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,|sd
A|maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.|sd
A|It was a housewife|sd
A|and she was home with two kids.|sd
B|Ugh.|b
A|And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something|sd
A|and they were arguing back and forth|sd
A|and she just kept talking the whole time,|sd
A|it was pretty funny.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|kind of hard that way.|bf
A|Okay.|b
B|Okay.|b
A|Hey thanks a lot,|ft
A|I'll talk to you later.|fc
B|All right,|fc
B|thank you,|ft
B|bye-bye.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|So, uh, what do you think?|qo
A|I think we're overtaxed to the hilt.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean, we're, we're taxed on taxes|sd
A|and, um, uh, most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is.|sd
A|I mean we don't have one yet,|sd
A|but eventually they may try to push it through.|sd
B|Oh really.|b
B|So they have|bf
B|I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas.|sd
A|No, no state income tax.|sd
B|Oh, that's great, because they don't have it in Florida.|sd
B|In New York they have it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York|sd
B|and we have a state tax as well.|sd
B|So that just cuts even more.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|I, I think that I,|sv
B|I mean, I wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't, they don't go to any place.|sd
B|You know, you don't see it going to any place where it belongs.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|aa
B|but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.|sv
A|Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local,  that it  takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck.|sv
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Well that's certainly true.|sv
B|Well what is it they were just talking about, um, sort of middle income, you know, how, how, middle income people,|sd
B|what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, you know, they wind up having kids as a deduction|sv
B|and after, but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think|%
B|so they want to, you know try I think they're trying,|sv
B|I think I think that most of the politicians understand this.|sv
B|They just don't, they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing.|sv
A|Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And, uh, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a, a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody.|sv
B|I agree,|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|And, uh, I don't know how we're going to do that right away though,|sd
A|but, what, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, uh, a bite out of our savings.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly,|aa
B|and then, and then, uh, I'm, I'm just not sure if I see, you know, if I see it going, like I say to the right places.|sd
B|I mean, it'd be, it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, but I'm not convinced, that's, that Social Security is doing as well as it should and, you know, and, and, and, uh, and, and that, you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it. But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be getting it|sd
B|but instead I think it's going to the wrong places.|sv
A|And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme.|sv
B|You think so?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it's, uh, you know,|%
A|right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit.|sv
B|I know|aa
B|and that scares the hell out of me.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's illegal, see.|sd
A|If, uh, most company, uh, C E O were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.|sv
B|Yeah|b
A|So how are we letting them get away with it.|qh
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't, I don't,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|it'd be nice if we sort of, as one, band together|sv
B|and, and, uh, and, an performed a citizens arrest, I guess.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|To  see if we could sort of clean them up|sd
B|and you know, but I don't know if we can do that or not.|sd
A|A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on,  in  the taxing system.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I agree,|aa
B|I agree.|aa
B|But, um, yeah,|%
B|like, like you said, I wonder, you know, if, if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process|sd
B|and I wonder if it'll ever be a change process.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I sort of, I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong|sd
B|You know, all those things that really could be changed that aren't, you know, that, that aren't.|sd
B|And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|So, I don't|h
B|I, I, I have no idea what to do about it.|sd
A|Well there's no quick solution, or no sure fire easy answer.|sv
A|It's just going to take, uh, uh, really, uh, uh, uh, a combination effort, I think, of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer,  or  vote to limit the way it's spent.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|See,  we, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|We don't,|aa
B|I mean, the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another.|sd
A|Right|aa
A|and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|I've never quite understood that. I've never, uh, you know, even though, um, I, I've never been, uh, sort of politically minded,|sd
B|but it's never been clear to me as to sort of, um, you know, how Congressmen an, can, can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doesn't back them up on anything, you know.|sd
B|And often times that will happen.|sv
A|Well they feel invulnerable to, uh, any wrath|sv
A|or,  uh, it's,  it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises.|sv
B|Right|b
B|Right.|b
A|And generally it does work out that way.|sv
B|They do forget, it's true, because everybody,|sv
B|think of what happens is whenever the whenever the one who made that supposed mistake turns around|sd
B|and, uh, his, his or her opponent can say well look, they did this.|sd
B|And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So it becomes, uh, a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils, I think,|sv
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|I don't know,|h
B|I just, uh, I'm unhappy with it|sd
B|but.|%
B|And well, I'm, I'm sort of semifortunate right now,|sd
B|I'm a graduate student,|sd
B|so I don't make that much,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school.|sd
A|Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know.|sv
B|But it's, my, my, my wife has a real job|sd
B|and, you know, when I get her job, um, you know, we, we look at her paycheck, I'm just floored when I see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Especially around bonus time.|sd
A|Bonus time,|b^m
A|you have a bonus?|qy
B|Bonus,|b^m
B|she,|%
B|no,|nn
B|my, my wife does.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|My|%
B|I|%
B|no|nn
B|graduate students don't get bonuses.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure.|sd
A|So you're taxed on the bonuses too,|qy^d
A|right.|^g
B|My, my wife is taxed on her bonus as well,|sd
B|and that's a, that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean her bonus isn't that much,|sd
B|but they tax it as,|sd
B|I, I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So she gets destroyed on her bonus check.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, she works with in, in, in sales.|sd
B|So a good portion of her, you know, her salary is, is quarterly bonuses.|sd
A|Uh, sales is lucrative|sv
A|but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|well, yeah,|aa
B|she's not entirely sales, so it isn't, it isn't as lucrative as one would hope,|sd
B|but, it, it keeps us supported temporarily,  until  I can get a real salary and then get taxed more.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I don't know,|h
B|I I guess, I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it, and hope that it gets better|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I have, I guess about said what all I can think of to say.|sd
B|Same here,|aa
B|tough topic|sv
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's a rather touchy topic at that,|sv

B|do you have children in,|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I don't,|sd
A|I have a husband|sd
A|We don't have any kids yet.|sd
B|Okay, um,|b
A|About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, um, I guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.|sv
B|Well, I, I,|%
B|one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job|sd
A|This is true,|aa
B|uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-rounded education.|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|the humanities, the history, yeah,|bf
B|That's right, you know,|aa
B|the Renaissance man|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|right,|aa
A|no,|%
A|no,|%
A|no|%
B|and, uh, and if you get that you can,|sv
B|and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,|sv
B|That's exactly right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|And,|%
B|So the advice we gave to them was, number one, visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|This, this is true,|aa
A|Yes.|b
A|And if you want to go away,|^2
A|right,|^g
B|do you want to go away,|^q
B|how far from home do you want to be.|^q
A|Right.|b
B|What do you want in a college.|^q
B|Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer|sd
A|Good.|ba
B|so he wanted to swim in school,|sd
B|but he did not want to be in a swim factory.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,|bf
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's the University of Texas at Austin, or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Texas|b^m
A|yeah,|b
A|Okay,|b
A|well that's, I think the other thing is, too, um, I know I went to a, uh, city high school in Chicago|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were,|sd
A|and economics was the choice|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.|sv
B|He is very, very strong academically,|sd
B|yeah,|%
B|so, we've just,|%
B|but, you know, he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice.|sd
B|He did apply to a large, you know, large group,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|University of Penn,|sd
A|I'm originally from Pennsylvania.|sd
A|University of Pennsylvania,|sd
B|It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's strong,|sv
A|I mean that's you know|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. Um, more diverse|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|and it, but it does have the under, you know,|sd
B|that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, I guess about four thousand.|sd
A|At Williams or Pennsylvania?|qy
A|At Williams,|qy
B|At Pennsylvania.|sd
A|At Pennsylvania.|b^m
A|Well how large is Williams?|qw
B|Williams is an undergraduate school only|sd
A|Right.|b
B|um, and it's a total of two thousand.|sd
A|Well that's not bad.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred|sd
A|Which is a lot,|^2
A|Yeah.|b
B|and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he did go on college visits,|sd
B|and he liked,|sd
A|That's the thing to do,|sv
A|I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,|sd
A|and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|yes|aa
A|Combined .|sd
B|it's large,|sv
B|and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that is too much,|sv
A|and I mean, I, um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont,|sv
B|Oh, it's,|%
B|so you,|%
A|Um, and that was, this was twenty years ago|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Showing my age,|sd
B|And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|Oh my God,|ba
A|where are you from,|qw
A|well, let's not talk about that|ad
B|No|aa
B|but we've been there when whose gone up there.|sd
A|It's, um, in that area.|sd
A|I mean I just can't say enough about it.|sd
B|Oh, it's, it|sd
B|we went|sd
B|and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air|sd
B|and he, he met the students at both schools|sd
B|and he liked them.|sd
A|Well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a, a strong, um, business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's it.|aa
B|The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, you know, to apply to a  school   with a good  technical program,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they usually,  Yeah,|^2
A|but they usually don't.|sv
B|but, uh, for, if you're going into,|sv
B|if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|but they,|sd
A|no|%
A|but who does.|qh
A|I mean, I think,  I think  all, I think the majority of people just don't know.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|No|%
A|he looked at criteria such as location, size of school uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|No|%
B|he didn't apply to any school further,|sd
B|the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours.|sd
A|That's still pretty far though.|sv
A|I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours|sd
B|and Williams is about seven.|sd
A|Oh, that's not too bad.|ba
B|Yeah|aa
B|so, well, I mean he, so it wasn't,|%
B|he, you know,|%
B|then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train|sd
B|and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and he will,|sd
B|and if, it came down I mean, as he, he came,|sd
B|he's been talking to them|sd
B|and, and he came down|sd
B|and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend|sd
B|and he had an absolutely marvelous time|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he had a great time|sd
B|but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun.|sd
A|That could very well be|sv
A|and, So he's developing his, his, uh, internal instincts right now.|sv
B|and he said it almost|sd
B|I think it backfired.|sd
A|That's good because I mean I'm sure what he said was true, that, uh, you,|sv
B|So.|%
A|well actually that's one of the reasons I went to ,|sd
A|Kenyon, he he made a good choice.|sv
A|I went,|sd
A|I, well I was supposed to,|sd
A|but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,|sd
A|it was just too far away,|sd
A|it was too different uh, the level of income of lot of the students|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,  um, in  terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|Of course, that period too was probably difficult.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|you're right|sv
A|but then I went,|sd
B|But I did, uh,|sd
B|my advice to him, and my was that, uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|He had to look at himself.|sd
B|Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip|sd
B|and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where, especially in a Kenyon or a Williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline|sd
B|That's,|%
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|yeah.|%
B|And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,|sd
B|and he will know the professors in a small,|sd
A|Well I don't know how to put this either in this way|h
A|and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this|sv
A|but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do. You know|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|and, um,|%
B|And, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help|sd
A|That's right.|aa
B|he had,|%
B|I told him to look to yourself.|sd
B|Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred  that you're really  going to look him up|^q
A|Right .|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures|^q
A|This is very, very,|sv
A|Oh.|b
B|and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having  graduate assistance teaching.|sd
A|They have video lectures.|^2
A|Yeah.|b
A|Video lectures.|b^m
B|They have  graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.|sd
A|This is true,|aa
A|and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the,|sv
A|did he just make the decision today?|qy
B|he made the decision, uh, I'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago|sd
A|How funny|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I mean, that's so funny. I mean,|sv
B|and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him|sd
A|That's funny.|ba
B|and, uh, I mean, and he, they were really nice,|sd
B|and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,|sd
B|but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.|sd
A|It was easy for him to rule out.|bf
A|He knew what he didn't want|bf
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|that's exactly,|sv
A|yeah.|%
A|Now is your other,|qy
A|I mean we're talking about what you think,|sd
A|but obviously you're experiencing it. Uh,|sd
A|Did your other son, um,|qy
B|My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.|sd
A|A clam.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|He,|%
B|the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.|sd
B|He's a classical guitarist|sd
A|Oh, wonderful.|ba
B|and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he decided he was going to go to the, um the smaller now, and then graduate school later.|sd
A|The smaller and the,|^2
A|And they'll do fine in their studies,|sv
A|and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,|sv
B|Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,|sd
B|and he's minoring in English,|sd
B|and he had thought about economics,|sd
B|and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't,|sd
A|or is this early admissions?|qrr
B|He's, um, he's going to be a junior.|sd
B|He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring.|sd
A|So he's, So he's, yeah,|bf
A|well sounds like you have two talented sons.|sv
B|Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.|sd
A|I think, and a lot of people talk about,|sv
A|and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,|sd
A|but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges because of that,|sv
A|and I think it's rather sad,|sv
B|Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,|sd
B|this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage.|sd
A|You are wonderful parents|sv
B|Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.|sd
A|No,|b
A|and I agree,|aa
A|I mean, my husband and I,|sd
A|in fact, I'm taking my L S A T um,|sd
A|I'm thirty something and taking my L S A T on June tenth.|sd
B|Oh, good,|ba
B|that's wonderful.|ba
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn|sv
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's exactly,|aa
A|and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're,|sv
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I guess I'll start, um,|ad
A|one, uh, big thing that, the advise that I would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their, let their child experience college in a kind of general sense.|sd
A|I like large colleges because I went to University of Texas at Austin,|sd
A|they have fifty thousand students there.|sd
A|And I feel like that now if I went, if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have, have gotten as much exposure to different people and different, uh, I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.|sd
B|That's interesting,|ba
B|I went to a smaller school,   of probably three thousand, thirty-five hundred.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I, I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and  we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds,  and so forth,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um,  one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand,  and,  and, you know,  different perspectives,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|I, uh,|%
B|but  it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of, sort of thing.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I could see, I could see that point, I could see how it would be.|sd
A|I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, um, because like we would have biology classes that did, main courses that everyone has to take, I mean, hundreds of students in this class,|sd
A|so,  actually,  yes, you were a number.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, um, I, I just,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|I'm thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.|sd
A|It just seems like in a larger college you, I don't know, your exposed to so many more people from all over the world,|sv
A|and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of, of the different cultures there,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|not that  it's, not that it's better|sv
A|but I'm just saying that I think that big,|sv
B|That's one thing to definitely consider.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|I think, uh, a lot of, a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college,|sv
A|a lot of the students that I talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor, um, they,|sd
A|or they're considering going to Baylor,|sd
A|they're also considering going to U T Austin|sd
A|but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students,|sd
A|and I have to tell them that just like, just like I live in Waco|sd
A|it's a large city,|sd
A|I can still function, in my own kind of area, in my own group.|sd
A|I have a job,|sd
A|I have my friends,|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|and I'm  really not as, as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big, a big university, you're not as concerned about the entire university,  but  your group of friends, your classes, your interests, your clubs and things like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school,  but  what, what is the particular needs of the students|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, um, larger university setting,  some  of the students, um, when I was, when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They needed, uh, at least at first,  they needed  a smaller setting that, that was more like family where they could get one-on-one,  from,  from teachers, professors and so forth, and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where, where, when they had a little more self-confidence built up, oh, yes, I can do this, oh, I've done this before, it's just in a bigger setting,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and  so maybe to me the key would be what is a the, the students needs,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's these other things that you and I are, are keying off on,  that,  that are really more of an education that,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they're the things that don't show up in,|sv
A|On paper.|^2
B|That's right,|aa
B|that's right.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
A|That's, that's one important thing that I think about school.|sv
A|I'm, I'm not a kind a person that,|sd
A|I didn't,|sd
A|I, I was kind of a B student, I guess you'd say,|sd
A|and I didn't really,|sd
A|I was|%
A|I strived to be an A student|sd
A|but it wasn't like a real priority.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be getting into as many organizations as I possibly could,|sd
A|and, and one other point I was going to make, was that I can I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends,  because  you, like you said, you know, you know, everybody knows everybody,|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and  so, you probably come out of it knowing, and by friends, I mean, like contacts for when you get out of school, um, you know,|sv
A|you just, you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with,  more  so at a small college then a large college.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|You may have gone to school with them|sv
A|but you wouldn't, you wouldn't know them.|sv
A|Uh, I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college, um,|^h
B|I guess, I guess now I've been out for,|sd
B|I, I'm older than you.|sd
B|I've been out for twenty-one years.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I was looking at an annual last night,|sd
B|something had it sparked a question,|sd
B|and I went to a small private school,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|um,  and it was church related.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here|sd
B|and I've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years, where I go to church now, there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as I,|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|and  it's, it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you  know, we weren't all out to be teachers or, or whatever|sd
B|so we didn't have the same classes,|sd
B|but we had a common thread,  something  that still ties us together,  twenty  odd years later.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Wow.|ba
A|That's great.|ba
B|And it's, it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things, those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I,|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|I have  something more important to me than that.|sd
A|That's great,|ba
A|that's great.|ba
A|Yeah,|%
A|that's what I, that's basically what I, and, when I first,|sd
A|I've been out of college only two years now, so it's still pretty fresh on my memory,  um,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but now that I'm out,|sd
A|when I went into school, my parents told, well,|sd
A|my,|%
A|okay, let me, let me go back to my, my sister now is in college,  and  my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her, on her, uh, diploma, etcetera,  and  so forth,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school,|sd
A|and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics|sd
A|and I wanted her to get the life experience,  out  of it,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so it was, you know,|sd
A|she went the academic way because she's a straight A student, which is,|sd
B|I was going to ask who won|sd
A|yes,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|so, she, you know,|%
A|that's probably,  you know, what she, what she wants anyway|sd
A|but that was the big deal|sd
A|and,|%
B|In, in that case, uh, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed,  and  finding a school that, that met her specific requirements,  and,  and made the best fit for her.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|And that, that's another point is that, the, a parent should tell their child to be or, or to give their child the leeway to choose their school,  not  so much choose the school for them but, you know, kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think it helps,|sv
B|a, now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to, uh, what's now U T Arlington,  because  it was there in my hometown,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I could live at home.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But I chose to go to another school|sd
B|and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school, he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money,|sd
A|Huh.  Right,|b
B|and  I think I value my, my education more because I had to work for it.|sd
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And because I knew all along that's what I wanted,  even though  I had to buck the family in order to, to do what I needed to do.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Right.|b
A|Well, that was pretty courageous|sv
B|Um, I guess, I guess it was, it was my mother's support that got me through it,  that  and ten years of, of, uh, loans  after I got  out|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah,|ba
A|yeah.|b
A|I'm, I'm dealing with the loans right now,|sd
B|Sounds familiar, huh?|qy
B|Your,|%
B|it's very fresh in your memory.|qy^d
A|very,|sd
A|every, every month|sd
B|I,|%
A|That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, sorry about that Tanya|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Oh, well, I guess I'll get over it.|bd
B|I'm sure it was worth it though.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Okay.|%
B|If, if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|if  nothing else just those experiences beyond and, and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve,  whatever  you set your mind on,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the, you,  you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make, to give you the, the potential to do whatever you wanted.|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|because when you, when you do want, when you do finally graduate that, that's what you need the most.|sv
A|I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage, uh, ,|sd
B|Young lady,  you have gotten your education then,|sv
A|words, it,|sd
B|that, that's right.|aa
A|Yes,|aa
A|I'm needing, you know, my, I'm needing to rely on myself,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I think I learned a lot of that in school too.|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|there we go.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|great.|ba
A|So, do you play golf at all?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I do,|sd
B|I'm a player.|sd

A|Actually, I don't.|sd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|No,|nn
A|uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit|sd

B|Oh, well, my husband is, is a very good golfer.|sd
B|He has got, like a six handicap.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|that is real good.|sv
B|So, uh,|%
B|and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.|sd

B|well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.|sd
A|Wow,|ba
A|so you have been playing,|bf
B|But, but, I really enjoy it.|sd
B|So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.|sd
B|Well, have you played recently?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um|sd
B|Oh|b
A|That seems to have been a mistake,|sd
A|I don't know. Um.|h
B|Oh, that's okay.|bd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I have not played in a long time.|sd
A|Um, when I was,|sd
A|about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him|sd
A|and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,|sd
A|I forget which one it was.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|the slice goes to the right|sd
B|and the hook goes to the left,|sd
B|I think.|h
A|Yes,|aa
A|I was slicing, actually.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I went and took some lessons,|sd
A|and a I got a little bit better,|sd
A|but I but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,|sd
A|and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.|sd
A|And I, And I still have this slice ,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I think that's really a good thing to do.|sv
B|So, where, are you in your life,|qw
B|I mean, are you in school?|qy
A|I'm a graduate student,|sd

B|Oh, okay,|bk

A|and I,|%
B|Sure.|b
A|Occasionally, uh, uh,|%
A|a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we will, we will, we will play, you know.|sd
B|And you don't, you don't have the length of the playing time that we do.|qy^d
A|I have, I have very at the moment I have very little playing time.|sd
A|When I, when I go on vacation, my father and I, uh play a little bit.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|But, I don't, you know,|sd
A|we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.|sd
A|Because, .|%
B|Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.|sd
B|Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because, that's my, I can't hit a driver very far|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,|sd
B|I use a three iron off the tee because, I have more control over it.|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.|sd
B|So, I'm still using a three iron|sd
B|and my husband is trying to get me into using a, you, know, like a high number wood instead.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|But, those are, uh, still not you favorite, huh?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|it's not my favorite,|sd
B|but, I, I, uh, I enjoy,|sd
B|I, I really do,|sd
B|I think I'm going to like golf the older I get, and the more time I have to play.|sd
B|I, we have three teenage daughters.|sd
A|Uh, wow, .|ba
B|One is,|sd
A|You must be very busy.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I'm very busy,|sd

A|Um.|%
B|And, we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, you know, along the Pacific Ocean, this past spring.|sd
B|And that was, I told my husband, that was the way to play, you know,|sd
B|that was,|sd
B|if I could play there every time I want, it was, it was great.|sd
B|A neat experience|sd
A|Miniature golf, there's my game. Uh.|sd

B|if you ever played,|sd

A|Right.|aa

A|actually, we have a very very, um,|sd

B|tell me about your clubs up there.|ad

B|Locust Hill?|br
A|Yeah,|aa
A|the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.|sd

B|Oh, great.|ba

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it's, um, not only that,|sd
A|but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|ba
A|Because, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,|sd
A|they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I,|sd
A|but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,|sd
A|the course is so well maintained|sd
A|and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to ,|sd

A|the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|ba

B|Oh, sure.|aa
A|You know.  It's all over the news,|sd

A|and you sort of stink, like me,|sd
B|Well, it's, it's just such a difficult thing.|sv

B|It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement. You know.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.|bf
A|oh yeah.|aa
B|And I worry about that.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,|sd
B|I have got to hit it.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Exactly,|aa
A|It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,|sd
A|I have .|sd
A|It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long you know, than with a driver or something.|sd
A|Oh, driver.|^2
B|Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you want to see it hit the green.|sv

A|Watch where it's going.|bf
B|Yeah,|b
B|so. I I don't know what I'm supposed to ask questions about,|sd

B|I know that.|sd
A|That's okay,|aa

B|Well, uh,  when I,|sd

A|Both.|sd

B|Okay.|bk
A|I believe so.|sd
B|Okay,|b
B|well I really did not know  so I,|sd

A|I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out,  until  afterward|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Okay.|b
B|Cause this is only my second day doing it|sd
B|and I just did not, I did not know|sd

B|we, I just started yesterday.|sd
A|I have been doing this for awhile, actually.|sd
B|Have you?|bh
A|It seems like it's been a while.|na
B|Yeah.|b

B|I had a ,|sd
A|and,|%
B|I see.|bk
A|My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.|sd
B|I see.|bk
A|And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail|sd
A|and, To be honest, I, I really have not been accounting,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, if it works, it works.|sd
A|So ,|%
B|Well, my, uh,|%
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|do you, uh, think we should go metric?|qy
B|Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.|no
B|It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens|sv
B|and things make sense.|sv
B|Um, it's, it's a switch.|sv
B|The problem would just be the switch over.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I think that the, I think what,|sv
A|I mean, I don't know what happened last time.|sd
A|I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something|sd
A|and,|%
B|Right.|aa
B|That's when I was in the elementary school years|sd
B|and we all, We all learned that metric|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|me too.|sd
B|and they were ready,|sd
B|we were going to be metric|sd
B|and,|%
A|Right,|aa
A|and, and I don't quite know why it failed.|sd
A|Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,|sd
A|so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out|sv
A|so,|%
B|So I think that's what they did at first, was that they had metric|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.|sd
B|We have metric cola now,|sd
A|Right,|aa
A|I was just thinking, two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles.|sd
B|you can buy that|sd
B|and you can,|sd
A|You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.|sd
B|So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,|sd
B|but no one talks about, you know, uh,|sd
B|you buy nine by twelve frames,|sd
B|you don't buy centimeter length frames, and cooking pans.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers,|sd
A|you don't say,|sd
A|I went, a hundred kilometers. You know.|^q
B|Uh-huh .|b
B|Right,|b
B|fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I would, I would be total loss.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's,|%
A|I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over, you know,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed|sv
A|and, pardon my expression there, but, uh, who would get really, you know, upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it really would.|sv
B|It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could I mean|sv
B|because I think our generation could make a change.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|It would be difficult,|sv
B|but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|That's|%
A|Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And if they kept it up,|sv
A|so let's say, imagine they had kept going,|sd
A|you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Not like could use it comfortably right now,|sv
A|but I could convert, you know,|sd
A|I could carry around a little conversion card or something|sd
A|and, I could handle it for a while, and then, and then eventually I'd learn,|sd
B|Right|b
A|and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|And now I think there are enough people,|sv
A|you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,|sv
A|and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying, what are you, crazy, we can't understand you.|sv
A|We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck,|sv
A|but it's for the better|^q
A|and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
B|That makes sense.|sv
A|I don't know.|h
A|I, I, I would hope it would, uh,|sd
A|it seems like it's a reasonable system.|sv
A|I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.|sv
B|Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,|sd
B|and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.|sd
A|Right|b
B|When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,|sd
A|Centimeters.|b^m
B|and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in in pounds.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|But I wonder if, if,|sd
B|So all the dieters would be happy|sv
A|But yeah|b
A|right|b
B|I only weigh sixteen today.|^q
B|That's,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.|sd
A|They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,|sv
A|so start, you know, from now,|sv
A|like from now on all licenses would have that, rather than going back and changing everything, you know, all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that, tells you how tall the robbers are when they, to hold it up.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|I know the,|sd
A|and, oh, yeah,|%
A|I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two, inches or something. You can't walk in here.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|You have to be under.|^q
A|Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh,|sd
A|see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.|^q
A|That's right.|aa
B|Just so you'll know,|^q
A|It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?|qy
B|I know England is not metric.|sd
A|But I don't know.|no
B|I, I don't think they are, because our, um, our measurements started in England,|sd
A|England is not?|qy^d
A|Oh.|b
B|all that began back there,|sd
B|and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|but I mean,|%
A|but, but virtually the rest of the world is.|sd
A|I mean, it seems like like, like, like sort of stupid.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans|sd
A|and we're supposed to be, you know,|sv
B|We're the trend setters in the world.|^2
B|I don't know why we, We haven't changed to the sensible system.|sd
A|That's right,|aa
A|and, and now we're backwards.|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything,|sd
B|is it?|^g
B|It,|%
A|No,|nn
A|actually, no.|nn
A|Um, let's see,|^h
A|it's,|%
B|Well, pounds,|sd
B|I don't even know what that,|sd
A|I don't know.|h
A|Oh, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I, I always forget.|sd
A|I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.|sd
A|I just sort of make it up.|sd
B|See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.|sd
B|It's,|%
B|I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from,|sd
A|Right|b
A|Those, those wouldn't be a problem.|sv
B|It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know.|sv
B|A lot of stuff,|sv
A|Let's see,|^h
A|how many cups equal that?|qh
A|I, I have no idea.|sd
A|I just, uh,|%
A|I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.|sd
B|Right|b
B|I don't, I didn't even know that|sd
A|That's all I know.|sd
A|I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine,|sd
A|I, I had two friends,|sd
A|and, I had more friends than that,|sd
A|but two friends of mine in college,|sd
A|I had a lot more than two,|sd
A|I promise.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|Um, we opened a jelly bean business.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And we sold jelly beans,|sd
A|and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know,|sd
A|we, we didn't we didn't bother buying a scale.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And we, we didn't bother buying a scale,|sd
A|and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major|sd
A|and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around,|sd
A|and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.|sd
B|Did you ever check it to see if it really was, a pint?|qy
A|Gee, I think, I think he the calculation at home,|sd
A|and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So, so we were giving them a little too much,|sd
A|but that was our general tendency anyway.|sd
B|Well, that's,|%
B|you all are nice business|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well, we were, you know, we were in,|sd
A|it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school,|sd
A|we really didn't, make, you know,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year. You know, after, after an entire semester,|sd
B|Right|b
A|but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.|sd
B|Probably ate all your merchandise too.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|we, we, we tended to eat a lot,|sd
A|and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it,|sd
A|and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology, I guess,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he got into a snowball fight, with the jelly beans nearby,|sd
A|and he just,|sd
A|and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off|sd
A|And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it's a little problem.|sv
B|What's inside the jelly bean?|qw
A|Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same,|sd
A|they're like an outer coating,|sd
A|and there's just sort of this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar.|sd
A|I don't know.|h
B|Uh, oh.|b
A|But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,|sd
B|Lucille Hughes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay,|b
A|Lucille, I'm on, on .|sd
B|All right,|b

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess I'm probably a lot like you.|sv
A|I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.|sd
B|Well, I certainly am too.|sd
B|Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.|ad
A|Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.|sd
A|They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.|sv
A|You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.|sv
A|I feel like everyone else,|sd
B|Um.|%
A|I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.|sd
A|It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it.|sv
B|Yes, sir.|aa
A|National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, uh, coaches?|qy
B|Is that part of our problem?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, you know.|sv
A|I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft.|sv
A|But,|%
B|Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really,|sv
B|I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.|sv
B|I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do.|sd
B|Roy, who's your next best team,|qw
B|or who do you like after the Mavericks?|qw
A|Oh, gosh,|ba
A|I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know.|sd
A|Probably the Boston Celtics.|sd
A|I've just always like the Boston Celtics.|sd
A|They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,|sv
A|and, but they're still playing good ball.|sv
B|Well.|%
A|But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,|sd
A|but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,|sd
A|so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.|sd
B|We certainly need to support them,|sv
B|do we not.|^g
A|Yes,|ny
A|we do. You know.|sd
B|Do you go to the game?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I go to a few games.|sd
A|I haven't been to many.|sd
A|I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.|sd
A|I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,|sd
A|and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|it does|sv
B|I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.|sv
A|Oh, you bet.|aa
B|But, um, maybe next, maybe they can do some.|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|who do they need to trade?|qw
A|Well, I don't know.|no
A|It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team,|sv
A|they just,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,|sv
A|but, and that can really help the team,|sv
A|but they do that,|sv
A|they trade the nucleus of their power right now.|sv
B|Yes, sir,|aa
B|it seems that way to me.|sd
B|I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have|sd
B|and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,|sd
B|but we really need to do something.|sv
A|Well, you know, I feel like, uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.|sd
A|I like their coach.|sd
A|I really like a lot,|sd
A|and I just, I think he deserves a good break.|sv
A|I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.|sv
A|I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also.|sv
B|I really.|%
B|Yes, sir.|ba
A|This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.|sv
B|And they have just done as much as they can for that man,|sv
B|and he apparently can't straighten his act out,|sd
B|so we need to, to build on something more positive than that.|sv
A|You bet.|aa
A|I think they're fools if they ever bring him back|sv
B|Oh, I do, too.|aa
B|I certainly would agree to that.|sd
A|Hate to put it that way.|sd
A|I just would not believe him any more.|sd
B|Well, it, um,|%
B|I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances|sv
A|No.|aa
B|and I think he has gone over the limit.|sv
A|There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water|sd
A|but you can't make him drink.|^q
A|So,|%
B|That's right.|aa
A|And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.|sv
B|Well.|%
A|But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.|sv
B|It is tragic.|aa
B|I don't, um,|%
B|I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.|sv
A|Oh, I think you're right.|aa
A|Everything has been put out of perspective now.|sv
A|You know, you take a, a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league,|sd
A|and now he's probably an old age of, uh, twenty-five or six and making all that money,|sd
B|Yes, sir.|ba
A|well, that's, uh, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they, they need at that point in their life, I think.|sv
B|I think you're right.|aa
B|I believe that one,|sd
B|so.|%
A|I think, you know, it's created by,|sv
A|Alright Allen.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh, the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know, in their, the society we live in.|sd
A|What do you think has occurred there?|qw
B|Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.|sv
B|That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But are, are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the, uh, oh my gosh, I can't think of the word, but for the, what they have to accept that's they are responsible for.|qh
A|Uh, responsibilities is what I am trying to say.|sd
B|Oh, I don't think so.|ng
B|I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.|sv
B|In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals.|sv
A|By the same token, most, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.|aap_am
B|Yes|aa
B|I think  that's  generally speaking, pretty true.|aa
A|Is that right and wrong?|qy
B|And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, going is, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|And that, uh, they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years?|qw
A|Any individual thing|qy^d
B|Oh, boy.|ba
A|or is it just a general switch over?|qrr
B|I think it's generally that switch over.|sv
B|And, and I think that switch over has been more in the work force.|sv
B|I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force.|sv
B|I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them, on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household.|sv
A|So do you think that is going to be uh, difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
B|I think also in terms of parenting.|sv
B|I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting|sv
B|and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.|sv
A|Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation, specifically?|qy
B|Well, I, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties|sv
B|and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be|sv
B|and I want to go back and do something else.|sv
B|I think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
B|People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.|sv
A|Well, I actually,|%
A|a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And the people.|sv
A|Well, how do you feel about women in, uh, armed services?|qw
B|Well, I think they ought to have the right.|sv
B|I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to or my wife and my daughter going into combat|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but I have problems with men doing that|sv
B|and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it.|sv
A|Um.|b
B|It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I somehow can't do that|ar
A|I, was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home, safe, secure, and made happy|sd
A|and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household|sd
A|and it, it really still bothers me.|sd
A|I spent plenty of years in the service,|sd
A|but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around.|sd
A|I mean how are they going to protect themselves  so to speak.|qh
B|I agree.|aa
A|It puts them in a very bad situation.|sv
A|I, I really don't go for that.|sv
B|I think one of the other things that concern, has concerned me a little bit,|sv
B|and I think I see some change in attitudes there.|sv
B|My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and there's, uh, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force, uh, fulfilling herself.|sd
A|Yep.|b
A|and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going|sv
B|And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's acceptable.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If they chose to go into the work force that's okay.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|If they chose not to, that's acceptable.|sv
A|And if they go into the work force, they should be treated as  nicely  as, as well as a man or any other person.|sv
B|As equals.|^2
A|And, uh, not,|%
B|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|so what do you think of the Giants?|qo

B|I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe, maybe three years ago really|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants.|sd

B|They got real good pitching,|sd

B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, you know.|sd
B|I don't really know what it is,|sd
B|but, but every team that's, that's really good seems,|sd
B|you know, like the A had, they had, they just had it all that one year.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|um I was mostly an A fan, you know.|sd
A|I had been to more games at the A than I have in the Giants because, uh, I lived in Oakland you know, for some time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way,  you know, you  good and the bad|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
B|but. It's, it's kind of hard.|sd
B|I still, basically, the, the,|sd
B|me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere,|sd
B|I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams,|sd

B|me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|about, about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo.|sd

B|It just might be the drive, you know more than anything else,|sd

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Or somebody basically,|sd

A|Uh, Greg,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|uh, I, I'm not familiar.|sd
A|I think, uh, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|we do have the death penalty here.|sd
B|It's not exercised very often,|sd
B|but we do have it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I believe it,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,|sd
B|but, uh seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that, that the person just, I feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in, in prison for life.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|aa
B|But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,|sd
B|but just seems like in some cases that it's a, it's a good policy.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh, I, I tend to agree with you,|aa
A|uh, I've changed my views over, uh, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest.|sd
A|Uh, uh, when I was in when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh,|sd
A|you know, that|%
A|the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|But the, uh, the more,|sv
A|now I live in downtown Dallas,|sd
A|and I, uh, you know, I've seen, uh, I've seen cases on, in the news and all where, where, you know, uh, a, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|I think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder.|sv
B|That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible.|aa
A|Yeah,|b
A|it seems sensible and failsafe.|sv
A|I, I, uh, I don't,|%
A|you know, not completely failsafe,|sv
A|but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.|sv
B|Right.|aa
A|Uh I also, uh,|%
A|to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen, uh, I believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say Noriega for example that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh from society,|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|you're, you're right there.|aa
B|Uh, I|%
B|basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that I just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with|sv
A|Right.|b
B|so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I, I'm all in favor of it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, uh, do you, uh,|qy
A|are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?|qy
B|Well, I, I really don't know on that question.|h
B|It just seems like,|sv
B|for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.|sv
B|I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,|sd
B|so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live,|sv
B|but, you know, then you're kind of playing God which is never a good thing to do.|sv
A|That's true,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of.|sd
B|I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or serial killers|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.|ar
B|I think that they're, they're operating on a more,|sv
B|I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,|sv
B|but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because they're feeding our consumer needs.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Sure,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I understand, I understand your point.|sd
A|Yeah.|%
A|Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next|qy^d
A|and they do have the death penalty.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|so, uh, that was a curious case.|sd
A|I.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|that is very curious.|sd
A|Uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish to say the least.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's, that's right.|aa
A|Uh, well, here in Texas we, uh,|sd
A|I think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh,|sd
A|you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,|sd
B|Okay, I guess we're on.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.|qy
A|I wasn't in Central America|ng
A|but, uh, talking about Latin America, I kind of, I consider Latin America to include Central and South America|sd
A|and I did live in, uh, San Polo Brazil for four years.|sd
B|Do you, do you think that, that we should have given up the Panama Canal?|qy
A|Uh, realistically, I,|%
A|yes,|ny
A|I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big enough to, uh, accommodate the, the shipping that it once did|sv
A|and, uh, maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're certainly justified in, uh, our actions dealing with, uh, Noriega in this ...|sv
B|Well, there are those that, that, that think that, that, that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the military.|sv
B|Interestingly enough my father was, who was in World War One, and as, uh, as a civil engineer they, they, they offered him a commission as a captain if he would, uh, go in and, and, uh, help with the defenses of the Panama Canal.|sd
B|He had worked for United Fruit Company there,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they, uh, they, in fact, they had,|sd
B|this was in the, the late twenties|sd
B|and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over|sd
B|and, uh, he turned them down.|sd
B|It, it's interesting that, that most people don't realize how small the canal is.|sd
B|Have you ever been there?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I haven't.|sd
B|It's, it's really,|sd
B|I, I haven't been there,|sd
B|I've been to, been to Salvador|sd
B|and, and, uh, in fact, we went back to visit some friends of, of my fathers, that we went in fifty-seven I guess.|sd
B|And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.|sv
B|The thing I find interesting, though, is that, uh, is the whole colonial approach|sv
B|and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we support, uh,|qh
B|you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if you gave them a free election, they would vote for the,|sv

A|I have a, a little bit,|na

A|your,|%
A|you've got this, this toss up|sv
A|or not, not so much a toss up but a, a dilemma when, when you want a country to have its, its, um, own, uh, dominion, or its free rein over its, its own people.|sv
A|and now we're, we're in this dilemma over, uh, United States is, believes in democracy and, and self determination, where|sv
A|but that|%
A|on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, uh, agree with the, or, not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about, uh, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only, you, we used to see spheres|sv
A|but now we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.|sv
B|Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was economic.|sv
B|I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal|qy^d
B|but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua,|sd
B|uh, and, uh, there were, uh, there's a big, there's a big lake,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua,|sd
B|but the, the United States, uh, had some,|sd
B|and I've forgotten what the political influence was|sd
B|but there were economic ties then.|sd

A|Right.|b
B|but if there's no economic benefit,|sv

B|You look at Salvador where the,|sd
A|Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.|sv
B|Yeah,|b

B|If they'll mostly leave him alone, uh,|sv

A|I mean they make, uh, they make the things that Custer did look like, uh, like trivial.|sv
A|And, uh, you get,|%
B|It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the exploitation|sd

A|Right.|b
A|Yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.|qy
B|I was a resident, although very young of the of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.|sd
B|Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.|sd
B|Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,|sd
B|and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.|sv
B|What is your situation?|qo
A|Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.|sd
A|Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.|sv
A|Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.|sv
A|However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.|sv
A|I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.|sd
A|I did Peace Corps training there.|sd
B|Oh that's very interesting.|ba
A|And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student|sd
A|and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California|sd
A|and so the Spanish was no problem.|sd
A|Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely|sd
A|and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.|sd
A|I have,|sd
A|actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico|sd
A|and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.|sd
B|Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid|qy
B|or,|%
A|Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,|sv
A|you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.|sd
A|I've live abroad most of my life,|sd
A|so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.|sd
A|I lived actually in Lebanon,|sd
A|so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.|sd
A|So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.|sv
A|I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.|sv
B|I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi|qy^d
B|or,|%
A|I think so.|na
B|Okay,|bk
B|that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.|sd
B|Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.|sv
B|I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.|sd
B|Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.|sv
B|But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.|sd
B|I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.|sd
B|How do you feel, though, about,|qh
B|well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,|sv
B|but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student|sd
B|and my parents were in the military at the time|sd
B|so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.|sd
B|I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.|sv
B|The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|%
A|those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.|sd
A|Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,|sv
A|I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I see what you mean,|aa
B|so that,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.|sv
B|Uh, there,|%
B|I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.|sd
B|Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,|sv
B|I,|%
B|and I'm thinking in terms of education.|sd
B|But then again each state sets its own|sd
B|and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.|sd
B|Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization|sd
B|and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country|sd
B|so,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, well actually I|%
A|one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.|sd
A|So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well that's interesting too.|ba
B|Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.|qy^d
A|I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.|na
B|And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.|sd
B|So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.|sv
A|Well that's interesting.|ba
A|Right.|b
A|What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.|qh
B|I think I would be troubled,|sv
B|I suspect, I believe that any of our states,|sd
B|and I,|%
B|constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.|sd
B|Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.|sd
B|I would be bothered by that.|sv
B|I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths|sv
B|and that's the, the, the melting pot.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,|sd
B|but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past|sv
B|and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.|sd
B|Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make|sd
B|and I think that that they would need to reassess that.|sv
B|Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California|sd
A|and I didn't have any problem with my students|sd
A|but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school|sd
A|and he can't speak a word.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And so, obviously it didn't work in California.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,|sv
A|Right.|b
B|and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.|sv
A|Oh, I see.|ba
B|Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Well I think we have gone to time|sd
B|and I appreciate your having called.|fc
A|Okay,|fc
A|well thank you very much.|fc
B|Good-bye.|fc
A|Bye,|fc
A|bye.|fc
A|So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?|qw
B|Well, I,|%
B|the biggest, uh, way it's going right now, uh, lot, most of the grocery stores have got, uh, things set up where you can bring in your, uh, plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then they've just got different barrels setting out|sd
B|, I shouldn't say barrels, like big John Doors or,  whatever  they're, called. Gondolas|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, they've got them set outside|sd
B|and,|%
A|Is it,  is it all voluntary?|qy
B|uh,|b
B|Yes.|ny
B|It's all voluntary.|sd
B|Now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, they just want to, uh, help recycle. Which is,  what  we do. You know,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we,|%
B|probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in|sd
B|and we let the kids get the money for that.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh,|%
A|There's,  a lot of projects where the, the Boy Scouts and things, and that will, collect your cans|sd
B||%
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true,|aa
B|but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know but,|%
A|I guess, I,|%
A|you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I know, I,|%
A|we're in Maryland,|sd
A|but, my,|%
A|I from Pennsylvania *missing copula?|sd
A|and my parents how, are forced recycling,|sd
B|Oh,  really?|bh
A|uh,|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|Uh, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the, uh,|sv
A|they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them.|sv
A|Now, up here in Maryland, though, we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.|sd
A|So, uh, so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles,|sd
A|and we save our newspapers,|sd
A|and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.|sd
A|And just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up|sd
A|and we dump them off there.|sd
B|So, it's|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
A|It's still voluntary,  though I think, I think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three, though where some aspects will be mandatory.|sd
B|you say it is  all voluntary.|sd
B|Do they,|qy
B|Will it be mandatory?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Is it all, um,|qy
B|is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff|qy
B|or is it all,|qrr
A|Mostly just the cans.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|And I,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|And that's,|%
A|and most of  the time, like I said, that's, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that, the schools do, or that the Boy Scouts do, or whatever.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|aa
B|That's,|%
A|Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for.|sv
B|Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,  and  stuff like that.|ar
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I said, are more concerned, with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I  think that's mostly,|sv
A|well, you know, we,|%
A|even before,|%
A|as soon as the community said, you know, We're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started, doing it.|sd
A|It was, it's one of those things,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be, separated, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's,|%
B|Well, I tell you, it's kind of funny now at, even at T I, I don't,|sd
B|do you work for T I?|qy
A|No.|nn
A|Huh-uh.|nn
B|Okay.|bk
B|Um, at T I they're doing recycling.|sd
B|I mean, for a long time they didn't do this,|sd
B|but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper.|sd
B|We have separate bins uh, separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|You know, and they,|%
B|I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees|sd
B|and, you know it's really,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I can't believe that you know. Because they've got it all posted all over the place how much,  they're saving and how|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|How much, how well they're doing.|^2
B|yeah.|%
A|We do,|%
A|I, um, I, I work in a, uh, speech interface lab,  at a,  at a, at a college.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And we do basically the same thing.|sd
A|The state of Maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, you know, in the giant bins around,|sd
A|and it's surprising how much you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage,  can  every night.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Yep.|b
A|You don't notice until,  you start leaving,|sv
A|you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full you just can't believe how much paper that you, uh,|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I know|ba
A|Reams of paper come,  out of  an office every day That , took us to recycle.|sv
B|Well, you think about, the waste, even.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, you know, cost wise and and, you know, like you saving trees and stuff like that.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|I mean, it's just amazing, you know,  the difference.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, I think,  Hopefully, if,|sv
A|you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?|qy
B|I haven't seen, anything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't.|sv
B|I don't watch much T V,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then, like I said, they do a lot of  internal,  advertising on that kind of stuff.|sd
A|Internal.|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But,  I haven't seen anything.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.|sd
B|I think they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That would probably,  be true.|aa
B|You know. So,  So, I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,|sd
A|you know, they'll come up and say,|sd
A|you know, they'll show you to encourage to encourage recycling.|sd
A|They'll,  say,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And here, those of us that Dumavra Power, which is our power company, that,|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,|^q
B|Right|b
A|and they,|%
A|and that,|%
A|we do this for the community,|^q
A|they put those on.|sv
A|So I, so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and just with voluntary, I think.|sv
B|Right.|b
B|Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools, I mean they do things to try and recycle.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, Oh, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, you know.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,|sv
B|and it's good to start the kids real young on,|sv
A|I think so, too.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|We weren't,  concerned.|sv
B|You know, and it's like,|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
B|You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, Hey, you know,  we're  ruining the earth,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|you know. And now everybody is doing something about, which is good.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago  you  know?|qw
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here in the, up in the, uh, uh, the, the New Englands area and also in, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be will be full in two years unless we cut back.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, I think that, that became,|sv
A|that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space, in some of the more crowded states.|sv
B|This is,|%
A|So, what,|%
A|you know, and no other state,|%
A|I'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space.|sd
A|They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your garbage here.|sv
B|Right|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|aa
A|It's really, tough.|sd
B|I think, that it, it really surprises me because of the cost savings.|sv
B|I mean, this is such a tremendous, amount of cost savings.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, why,|%
B|I can't understand why nobody saw that before.|qh
B|I mean, even, even not even the aspects of not saving the earth|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I,  mean,  it's, so cost, you know,|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|But, well,|%
A|Well, in some ways, I guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because,  I  know that, like in, Pennsylvania, they require them to, um, put their newspaper for recycling.|sv
A|But, the de-inking process that they have to, they use,  to  take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused um, is very expensive,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|and  also, it it produces a, a waste, a, um, a, liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet. they still have cost,  yeah, cost efficient, yet.|sd
B|Oh. I see,|b
B|okay.|b
B|Is not real cost efficient.|^2
B|Oh, okay,|b
B|okay. Oh,|b
A|Yeah.|%
B|I, understand that though.|sd
A|So, but others, you know, like tin cans and plastics,  are,  are really, uh, efficient, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They, they melt on quickly and can be, you know, just because of the, heating and things, getting glass.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|and glass.|^2
B|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
A|it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|That's true.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|%
B|And even,|%
B|I, I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, I mean, that kind of surprises me|sd
B|I mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,  enough  to use it again,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|but they can.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I I don't know either.|h
A|That's,|%
A|I know that though, I, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know,  they really pollute quickly|sd
A|and, you know, one,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wow.|ba
A|So, it's one of those things that they really,|sv
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I know|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|how terrible that is.|qh
A|So, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.|sv
B|Really.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know I really,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|I, I think that, I mean, I think that they really are doing a good thing now|sv
B|and I hope it keeps,|sv
B|well, I'm sure we'll keep up.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I,  agree.|aa
B|You know,|qy
B|I think it's really catching on.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, I, I think that,|%
B|I'm not sure if it,|%
B|I don't know,|h
B|I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory|sv
A|I do, too.|aa
B|Um, it,|%
B|because like we were asking some people that live in, um, North Dakota, Well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling.|sd
B|And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet,|sd
B|so no.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, so, I mean I don't know,|h
B|I think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,  know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I mean,  I don't know,|h
B|I think a lot of people still will,|sv
A|You know, I know that it's really funny.|sd
A|My parents are forced to do it|sd
A|and they,|%
A|Well, I personally don't have any problem with, uh, drug testing employees or potential employees, do you?|qy
B|Um,|b
A|I  mean, basically?|qy
B|Basically, no.|nn
A|Okay.|bk
A|I don't,|%
A|I really can't disagree with it.|sv
B|I, I, uh, uh,|%
B|the policy that T I has, I think is, uh, uh, very fair.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, I,|%
B|they first had a policy where they, uh, would test new employees|sd
B|and, then since I've been with them the last four years, uh, there's been in the last year, year and a half, um, they're doing random testing of all employees.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think that's really the only fair way to do it.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|I really think it ought to be|sv
A|you know, Junkins all the way down.|sv
B|And it is,|aa
B|it,|%
B|and from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down.|sv
A|Right,|b
A|as a matter of fact, I want to think they took the top managers first,|sd
A|isn't that a fact?|^g
A|I've been retired from T I about a year,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but  the program, you know, was still fairly new.|sd
A|I guess it had been going on, maybe almost a year,  before  I retired,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I was not, uh, ever called upon to do a drug test.|sd
A|I certainly wouldn't object to it,|sd
A|and I think random is probably, you know, the only really fair way to do it.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Um, I like it because, um,|sd
B|you know, I, I, I grew up in the sixties,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,  and,  uh, you know, I, I saw,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you know, I know my friends who were you know, druggies and,  friends  who weren't|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and, uh, you know, it's, I think it's a real problem,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, I,|%
A|absolutely.|aa
B|and I think  it, and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and,  and  a lot of problems.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so I'm hoping that, uh, a lot of other companies will, will follow the same path.|sd
A|I don't think they'll have much choice, do you?|qy
B|Um, probably not.|ng
A|Especially if they have anything do with, you know, government contracts, or anything.|sv
A|As matter of fact, I want to believe that the, uh, defense department more or less mandated that people, you know, who work on defense contracts, you know,   do some sort of, you know, drug testing.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I think that's really what maybe prompted T I to do it.|sv
A|I was in the, uh, Defense Electronic Division when I retired.|sd
A|I know it was, a, you know, it was a real hot, hot item there.|sv
A|I think, I want to think maybe they, you know, really got some nudging from, you know, D O D to do this sort of thing.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|So you you know the atmosphere, then.|qy^d
B|Yep.|ny

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|I agree.|aa

B|I mean, I'd like,  I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or,  or, uh,  who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs.|sv

A|as far as I know, it's, you know, seems to be a fairly accurate program, as far as, uh, you know, the testing goes.|sv

A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa
A|And offer you, you know, help if you need help.|^2

B|Yeah,|b
B|rather than just, uh put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself.|sd
A|Yeah.|%

B|That's not going to help anybody get over the problem.|sv
A|No,|aa
B|I believe  it is a, a, a medical problem.|sv

B|Um, of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world, too|sv

A|Not to mention alcohol.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|so I mean, there's a lot of things out there|sd
A|Yep,|b
A|yep.|b
B|I'm just glad that they, uh, decided not to, uh, tax drugs, otherwise they'd be legal,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was,  uh, an industrial company, and, you know, that T I purchased,|sd

A|But a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile, and you know, weighed the pros and cons, decided, you know, it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I mean, uh, you should have no objection to it,|sv
B|it's like, uh, going down to get your license and checking your eyes.|sv
A|That's right.|aa

B|Uh, it's a|%
B|I  mean, it's the basic premise with,  you  know, drug testing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|That's right.|aa
B|Especially some of the jobs, um,|sv
B|luckily I've always been in the engineering sector,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it,|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
B|But, uh, in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor,  and  down in some of those labs and stuff, yeah, I, darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by side, you know, that could kill me, by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs.|sv

A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|I do too,|aa

A|but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.|sd
B|Sure,|b
B|yeah.|b

B|That's right|aa
B|and it's such a personal challenge.|^2
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|it really is.|aa
B|More than competitiveness against someone else.|sv
B|It's, it's a competitiveness against yourself.|sv
A|And, you know, it's so frustrating,|sd
A|I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating.|qh
A|You think you do pretty good one day|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, it's, it's like a bullet going by.|sv
A|I'll bet, um.|ba

A|Really?|bh
B|And, uh, now that was very competitive.|sd

A|I imagine that they have, uh, some, a lot of homework, too.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|You know, this being a school night and stuff,|sd
B|so, uh, it's, it's in the same old you know, routine of, uh, you know, doing homework and, you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, uh, the other activities that we all have.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well, there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though,|sv

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But then there's that side of me that says, yeah,|sv
A|Right.|b

B|You know I, I trust people.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I'll do that.|oo_co_cc
B|Or do I keep on going, well, we'll wait and see|qh
A|Well, I think there's a, a struggle within the Soviet Union.|sv
A|Um, I think the people are, are just fed up,|sv
A|and I think it's showing|sv
A|and all the republic is trying to gain their independence,|sv
A|and I think, uh, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's it's not just a or, uh, western society telling you it's, it doesn't work.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, they've always said, you know, the, the Soviet people were united,|sd
B|we believe this,|^q
B|and maybe they are seeing that, no, no, hey, we don't believe this, you know.|sv
A|That's right.|b
A|I think,|%
B|I guess I keep that one part of me that's like,|sv
B|well, I don't know I want to trust them|sv
B|and I,|%
B|it's like I can't,|sv
B|and maybe it's because, you know, we've had our own propaganda over the years,|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|Well, that, that could be.|aa
A|You know what I,|%
A|we always, we think of the K G B and we think such bad things, you know.|sv
A|But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, you know.|sv
B|And they probably do the same things.|sv
A|exactly.|aa
A|They do.|sv
B|You think the C I A doesn't spy?|qh
B|I'm sure they do.|sv
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|they do, you know.|sv
B|Now the difference is we don't, I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.|sv
B|You know, I think to that extent we don't go as far|sv
B|but I'm sure they lie. You know?|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|Oh, absolutely.|aa
B|So,|%
A|That's part of that propaganda thing,|sv
A|and I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, oh,|sv
A|excuse me, I've got a cold today.|fa
B|That's all right.|bd
B|I hope you get better|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Thank you.|ft
A|Um, I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are seeing, seeing it, you know, thinking K G B and C I A and all that|sv
A|but, uh just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they are, they ain't going to be able to feed their people this, this winter, you know.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's true.|aa
B|And I'm not against them being concerned|ar
B|but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and, and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|You know, I mean, you know, any, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, you know, because I, I understand that, you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|But at the same time I, I agree.|sv
B|I don't think we can do it and, and just, you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|You know, we've got, uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.|sv
A|I think the problem is, you know,|sv
A|on the international scope maybe the president feels that, uh, you know, for long-term relations with all these countries it's important|sv
A|and well, we'll, we'll always have the United States.|sv
A|And, you know, we need to solve these international problems|sv
A|but, um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|we, we, we believe in what he's doing abroad|sv
B|but, but like you said there's issues here too.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And but I, I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.|sd
B|I'm encouraged by what's happened in, you know, the, the iron curtain countries, you know, in, in that block|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, and I think it's moved in the right direction.|sv
B|I, I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight.|sv
A|Yep.|b
B|You know, it's not going to.|sv
A|No.|aa
B|It didn't happen here overnight,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|That's right.|aa

B|That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it?|qy
A|Right,|na
A|it really is,|sd

A|God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.|sv

A|and, uh.|%
B|Because everybody's  competing for jobs.|^2
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and they don't  want, uh,  to pay any benefits,|sv
A|so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get sick.|sv
B|Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.|sv
B|I, I have to think about it some more now, because my doctor is, uh, actually he's Canadian|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, he told me that there're a lot of, uh, lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't understand the arguments, exactly.|sd
B|He says it restricts your choice of doctors, and, and so forth.|sd
B|I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|I don't  understand  that either.|sd
B|I mean  we're on a private insurance plan right now,  uh|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|actually I have my own business,|sd
B|and and we,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|our health insurance is through my wife's employer,|sd
B|and, uh, and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can buy our medicine,|sd
B|and, uh, it changes every year|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|It's always so confusing.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor|sd
A|and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, you know,|sd
A|then I just sent cards in|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine,|sd
A|and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that, you know.|sd
B|Well, yeah.|b
B|Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the, uh, the limits of, uh, compensation,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but of course that is restricted choice,|sv
B|so I don't think that the restricted choice really, uh, has to do with the difference between, uh, public and private health insurance.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|I think it has to do with the, the, the, uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it|sv
A|Um.|b
B|and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way,|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true,|aa
A|that's true there.|aa
A|Well.|%
B|You, you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and, uh, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|right.|aa
B|And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, uh, lavish.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh.|%
A|But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything, you know,|sv
A|that,|%
A|people that's on unemployment.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|what happened to Reagan's safety net, anyway?|qh
A|I don't|%
B|Did he take that back to California with him?|qh
B|Using it for a trampoline now?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|probably so.|sd
A|I don't know,|h
A|but it is, it does seem to be a big problem, you know.|sv
A|I don't know what they're going to come up with,|sd
A|but, um, I sure wish they would come up with, with something,|sv
A|and, uh, like I say,|%
A|and, and I'm at the age, too, where the,|sd
A|I'll be fifty-seven in June,|sd
A|and the people don't want to hire people this age any more.|sd
A|And I worked for my previous company for twenty-six years, you know,|sd
A|so, it's kind of hard, you know,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|they'll be needing you in a couple of years, because they're running out of kids down that, the other end.|sv
B|And.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|they'll be calling at my door, huh.|sv
A|But anyhow.|%
B|Well, if they're smart.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, uh, with this problem, because, it, you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to ask him anything, costs you forty bucks you know, just for the visit.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then he,|%
A|then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, you know.|sv
A|And he might tell you, well, you know, now you're going to have to come back in a week,|sv
A|and then that's another forty bucks, plus whatever else he decides to do to you,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Okay, Bill, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now,|sd
A|who do you work with at this time?|qw
B|Well, I own the company.|sd
A|You own the company.|b^m
A|All right.|ba
B|I'm the president  and C E O of the company.|sd
A|My goodness.|ba
B|So, uh, I guess, uh, I determine what the benefits are|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess you do.|aa
B|But, uh, so what are you asking me,|qw
B|what, what benefits I think are most important?|qw
A|Well, what, what do you think of the,|qw
A|let's put it this way,|^h
A|what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, other than, other than their present salary?|qw
B|Um, I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, uh, such as, um, health insurance and life insurance and the, some type of retirement plan I'd say that, uh, most of the employees, uh, um, that we have really like a, a profit sharing plan.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|A profit sharing plan,|b^m
A|that's interesting,|sd
A|uh-huh.|b
B|They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, you know,|sv
B|because they feel like, well, we're contributing to it,|sv
B|so we'd like to participate in it,|sd
B|and so that means I make a little bit less,|sd
B|but the thing is that really you make a little more, because everybody has a interest in, in it working.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|because they they have a specific reason to do so, because they themselves benefit from doing a better job.|bf
B|Right.|b
B|I think most people, uh, don't want money, um,|sv
B|it's been my experience, most people want, uh, to feel like they're participating in something that, uh, that is not a drudgery, you know, that they  enjoy,  and that they can get some benefits out of.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|And it's a contribution.|^2
B|Right.|aa
A|Well, Bill, uh, that idea fits me exactly.|sd
A|I just retired from, uh, the university here,|sd
A|and that's been the goal in my life, was to contribute and, to the work that I was doing in my research,|sd
A|and that's what made me happy,|sd
A|and, uh, that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for,|sv
A|and I'm sure a lot of them don't.|sv
A|You can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, uh, our people get a lot of satisfaction.|sv
B|Um, we're a financial planning firm.|sd
A|You're a financial planning firm?|b^m
B|Yes.|aa
A|How many, uh.|qw
B|You said you retired,|qy^d
B|I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning,|sd
B|but  anyway,  uh, uh, we do, we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|well.|%
B|and, uh, it's real important, uh, that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that, where they were, that, uh, uh, that it take care of them.|sv
B|They don't,|%
B|none of them really want to be rich,|sv
B|but they like to have enough to be comfortable.|sv
A|Well, what, what changes would you, have you considered, uh, in doing it, to, to your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better?|qw
B|Well, um, we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a, a salary is, uh, is tie, um, uh, a percentage, um of business that, uh, that a person would participate and bring into the company.|sd
B|Uh, pay them, uh, based on the percentage of business they bring, instead of based on their salary.|sd
B|And the|%
A|When you  say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people to, to come in and, uh, ask for your support?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|not necessarily.|sd
B|Um, it can be in-house people who help you handle  X amount of dollars.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.|sv
B|Right|b
B|well see, we have we have marketing people,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and then we have financial planners,|sd
B|and, uh, then we have, uh, staff secretaries and administrative assistants,|sd
B|and these secretaries and administrative assistants, um, you know, if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company, they, they can get very dissatisfied very quickly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, so, uh, we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle.|sd
B|So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business.|sv
B|And, uh,|%
A|Yes,|b
A|but it,  it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job,|sv
A|but it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind of support.|sv
B|Well, and, and, but to,|%
B|see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to that, you know, that they work together with it encourages them not to, uh, complain when they realize that they get a part of the, of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying, well make me do it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|See, we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.|sv
B|I don't think  any|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think most people want to be, lack of better terminology, they want to be self-employed,|sv
B|but they don't want to take the risk.|sv
B|In other words, they like to control their own future,|sv
B|but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence,|sv
A|That's true.|aa
B|which,|%
B|that's what we have.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I guess its recording.|sd
A|Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?|qw

B|Oh, really.|b
A|Uh.|b

A|Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?|qy
B|Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,|sd
B|you could make the, like the granny squares or whatever, and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh.|b
A|I see.|ba
B|Nothing as big as a blanket.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff|sd
B|but,|%
A|I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket|sd

A|It's just too time consuming.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|do you have any other hobbies?|qy
A|Um, I like to sing.|sd
A|I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that.|sd
B|Oh, well that's good.|ba
A|Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter.|sd

A|No,|nn
A|not much,|sd
A|um, my day is usually pretty full.|sd

A|My schedule is like from nine to five thirty,|sd

A|so it's hard to make plans much less, you know, have a hobby.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|so. What do you do?|qw
B|Um.|b
A|Normally.|sd
B|I'm a housewife.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|But I've made a, um, few things, cross-stitch things.|sd
B|I really enjoy doing that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And um, I made, uh, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that, type of thing,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and it just takes a long time to get it done|sd
B|but, you know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to, to see it.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|I I showed mine to my boyfriend|sd
A|and he was like, you didn't make that.|sd
B|Really?|bh
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|it looks, uh, halfway decent|sd

A|How many children do you have?|qw
B|Two.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk

B|Uh-huh.|b

A|she's going to play it on Saturday|sd

B|the subject is, Latin America.|sd
A|Latin America,|b^m
A|yeah.|%
B|I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that,|h
B|I actually was planning a trip to Latin America|sd
B|and I got warned off by some people.|sd
B|They say Peru can't be traveled to|sd
B|and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth.|sv
A|Oh, really.|b
A|T I had a place,|sd

A|down,|%
A|I think it was Campinas,|sv
A|I'm not sure|h
A|and, uh, I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry, or whatever.|sd
A|And they had quite a few, uh, locations,|sd
A|not quite a few, several, in Latin America.|sd
A|I think the one in New Mexico is closed|sd
A|and I think the one in, in Brazil is closed,|sd
A|but I, I don't know why that is a problem down there|sd
A|and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too|sv
A|and, uh, an|%
A|some people say go to New York,|sd
A|but I don't, I don't have an answer to the crime rate.|sd
A|It's sad.|sv
A|That is a sad situation.|sv
A|I, I'd like to go down to Mexico, you know,|sd
A|and I keep hearing that, you know, the government and, and the crime rates pretty high too,|sd
A|that, that is sad. Uh, not that we can, uh, sell any great program we have with crime,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh. I think, uh, I'm kind of like you,|sv
A|I don't have any strong opinions on it.|sd
A|I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our, our neighbors down there is that we don't have any.|sv
A|We have more,|%
A|I guess ties,|%
A|we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything|sd
A|and we don't really, aren't that close to everyone in South America.|sd
A|I don't really know why though.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I don't understand it either, although I, I think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as, as bullying.|sv
B|And, uh, that's certainly from a historical point of view, would be true.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|I mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking, in, in his wildest dreams from his neighbors.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know that I saw in a book,|sd
A|I was reading a Spanish book, uh, not that I read Spanish, you know,|sd
A|I just, you know, reading some Spanish words|sd
A|and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans.|sd
A|They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too, you know,|sd
A|and I guess that's true.|sv
A|We don't think of any one else but|sv
A|I guess, we're kind of, uh, the smart asses in the world, I suppose, uh, or of America anyway.|sv
A|We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well I think they're going to have,|sv
B|that's a tough row for them to, to hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard, uh, citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans.|sv
A|As Mexicans,|^2
A|yes|b
A|that, that,|%
B|And they can stand on  their heads if they want too,|sv
B|but  I don't think that they're going, they're going to change that,|sv
B|and,  and, and really, I  mean North Americans I think are, when you say that even, I I mean, I tend to think of Americans and Canadians.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|I know.|sd
B|I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly speaking they are.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|I mean they were saying that of us, that we're the North Americans and they're Americans,|sv
A|they, they,|%
A|we always say we're Americans,|sv
A|and they, they want us to say we're the North Americans.|sv
B|Oh, I see|b
A|We're not Americans,|sv
A|we're  North Americans|sv
A|and they're South Americans,|sv
A|yeah.|%
B|I don't know.|h
A|Whatever,|sv
A|I, I don't want to make,|sd
A|I read it somewhere, though|sd
A|it's not my point, I guess,|sv
A|so|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|well it's, it's so interesting, I I just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no,|aa
A|they, they were lucky enough to have some oil, what, ten years ago, an,|sv
A|and they, they blew all that, and borrowed more money than they can pay back now|sv
A|and, uh, uh, so they're not exactly business men.|sv
A|I do think we should deal more with them.|sv
A|I don't, I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, uh,|sd
A|for the language, you know, is very foolish.|sd
A|I'm relatively familiar with Texas school system|sd
A|and we should teach Spanish at least in, uh, grammar school, you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish.|sd
A|I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, uh,|sv
A|and there are problems with, you know, the wet back problem, you know,|sv
A|for, everyone knows what we're talking about,|sv
A|say wet back problem.|sv
A|And then we should somehow, uh,|sd
A|and I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, uh, businesses, uh, at the borders of both sides so that you can, you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an, to, to get the jobs, you know,|sv
A|there, there may be some organized way to do this.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, I do feel for them, uh,|sd
A|they are very envious of us, or they wouldn't be coming up here, you know, risking a lot.|sv
A|Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, uh,|sv
A|getting thrown back I guess is all that, uh, happens.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You probably don't see that.|sv
A|Where,|%
A|we see it, you know, once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that.|sv
B|Well I grew up in Los Angeles.|sd
A|Okay,|b
A|well you see it, saw it out there then, too.|sd
B|And, uh, in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student|sd
B|so I, I knew, uh, the Hispanic part of L A pretty well.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And  certainly, you know, knew that problem,|sd
B|knew, you know, knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,  uh, it was, it was pretty wild.|sd
A|I think a, a common factor to a lot of problems, both, whether it be crime, if, if you want to jump on that, is mostly, uh, poverty.|sv
A|Uh, and I think a lot of their problems is poverty.|sv
A|If we could, uh, uh,|sv
A|the problems we have, in this country, is, is a lot of it's poverty.|sv
A|Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, I, that's another story,|sv
A|but, uh, uh, it is sad.|sd
A|There, there's so much down in all of South America, uh, so much potential, you know,|sv
A|we're,|%
A|T I, of course is, is really pushing world markets in their products|sd
A|and they're, they're mostly in, in Europe now and, in, in, in the Orient, Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore, uh,|sd
A|they're in Taiwan and Japan|sd
A|and they're, they haven't had, what, that much luck in South America|sd
A|and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And  there's got to be trade.|sd
A|I guess that's some of the answer, I guess is business, uh. Uh,|sv
A|and I try to be an optimist and say, well that, that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously is to, is to get some business going between each other.|sv
A|And we need, we need to do more of that, uh, somehow. And encourage more business,  between  us.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|They've got to have a lot of resources I would think. An enormous amount of, of well potential that way.|sv
A|A lot of it, of course is hot and jungle and all that,|sv

A|but, uh, there's going to be I guess thousands, I don't know how many thousands, or tens of thousands of these recordings|sd

A|I|%
A|they've got to be analyzing with a, a voice recorder some how.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well they record these|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and what,|%
B|and what is said.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And  they have a, they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening|sd

A|Oh, yes.|b
A|I know they change with age,|sd
A|I know mine changes, uh, has changed, uh,|sd

A|yeah,|%
A|I'm glad that you're in the business.|sd
A|That,|%
A|I|%
A|T I gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything,|sd
A|I've told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|you  wouldn't have to have a keyboard,|sv
A|you'll  be able to just give it commands|sv
A|and I'm sure they have some of that now,|sd

A|You know|qy
A|and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point,|sd

B|Well, with, uh,|%
B|their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,|sd

A|Correct,|ba

A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I, at, uh, not in my office|sd

A|I don't understand football.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, I prefer to,|sd
B|I, I like,|sd
B|I never used to really like watching football that much|sd

B|I, I prefer to watch, um,|sd
B|I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.|sv
B|And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game.|sd
A|Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.|sv
A|The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage|sv
A|but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.|sv
B|it's true.|aa
B|I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less, troublesome sports,|sv
A|Because|%
A|Yeah.|b

A|A love for them.|^2
B|Well, that,|%
B|not so much that|ar
B|but, uh, even in baseball you can,|sv

B|when I was young I could throw harder, than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I see.|ba
B|And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, having trouble.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, and I was a catcher|sd
B|so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff.|sd
B|So I,|%
B|that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I did that wrestling|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|No,|nn
B|I'd,|%
B|well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things|sd
B|and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.|sd
B|But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like,|sd
B|now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling,|sd
B|but it,|%
B|as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me|sd
B|then playing football this fall, I, it was just flag football too. I separated it again|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Oh, boy.|ba
B|so.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three.|sd
A|It was never set right.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.|sd
A|And, uh, one of the men that was in our on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.|sd
A|And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.|sd
A|And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.|sd
B|My God.|ba
A|So, uh, yeah|b
A|Um, it was really funny, you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, uh, follow through with my, uh,|sd
A|addressing that , to put the ball,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the, uh, pins.|%
A|So that was interesting.|sd
A|So I really, um, I got a lot of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm not sure where all my pins came from,|sd
A|but it's,|%

B|and I, um, I've seen, uh, well , just recently, um, WHAT ABOUT BOB?|sd
A|No,|nn
A|I haven't gotten to see you know, any real recent ones.|sd
A|I like comedies better than I do dramas.|sd
B|I, uh, am not one for the, uh,|sd
B|I don't need the suspense movies or the, the movies with lots of, uh, the horror movies with, uh, trying to shake you out of your chair.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?|qy
B|Um, I'm not sure|no
B|I, uh, I saw it and, uh, because my wife wanted to see it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise,|sd
B|and having gone, uh,|%
B|well, it really wasn't on a theme that I was, uh, uh, that into,|sd
B|or, as I say, I prefer the light movies that, uh,|sd
B|my style of entertainment is, is comedy, uh, primarily and then into action films.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
A|well, I didn't care for the movie myself.|sd
B|What?|br
A|I didn't really care for the movie either.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you kind of have to like to be, uh, drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well, okay,|b
A|on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN?|qy
B|Uh, yes.|ny
A|Do you enjoy that one?|qy
B|Uh, it was interesting,|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|well, I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, um, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.|sd
A|Oh, I haven't even heard of that one.|sd
B|Well, that was one where, uh,|sd
B|it's kind of like,|%
B|to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN.|sv
B|The, the story line, um,|sd
B|if you accept a few of the basic starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.|sd
B|Uh, it was hard to accept that, uh, this, uh, multimillionaire wheeler dealer would, uh, would, you know, find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|%
A|Well, I really liked PRETTY WOMAN.|sd
A|You know, I just,|%
A|well, you just kind of went with it.|sd
A|Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|But, um, FLATLINERS, now, it's a drama,|sd
A|and I don't usually like them,|sd
A|and I really enjoyed it.|sd
A|I, um, I don't know,|h
A|it was kind of,|%
A|it made you think a lot I think.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Did you see GHOST?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay,|bk
A|now, did you care for that one?|qy
B|Uh, that was,|%
B|I enjoyed that one.|na
B|I, in that I, I guess I, I hate to be too surprised in a movie,|sd
B|and in that one you could, you could pretty well guess where it was, going to end up.|sd
B|You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,|sv
B|but you knew where it would end up.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|See, now, I didn't,|%
A|I thought it was an okay movie,|sv
A|but it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I didn't think so, um,|sd
A|I really didn't care for the ending of it.|sd
A|I thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen,|sv
A|when, you know,|%
A|but, um, I don't know, you know.|h
A|Well, of course, uh, a bunch of girls had told me and warned me,|sd
A|and they said, "Oh, it's a real tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da.|sd
A|Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said well, when are you, when are you supposed to start crying, you know|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I didn't really, Uh, I didn't really find it to be a tearjerker|sd
B|Well, whenever she starts crying|sd
B|Well, do you go to many movies more than once?|qy
A|Um, if I see them more than once, I see them on video.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But like you said, I, I enjoy the comedies a lot better.|sd
A|In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, these days it's, uh,|%
A|You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.|sv
B|Well, if you don't, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, uh, left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, unless a movie is popular and stays around, uh, you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|So we have, um,|%
B|well, I think just most people have V C R now|sv
B|and we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No,|nn
A|I saw one, it was a drama also,|sd
A|and I can't think of the name of it now, that, um,|sd
A|it was a book before it came out in a movie,|sd
A|and it was, it it was a drama.|sd
B|Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES?|qy
A|I wanted to see that.|sd
A|I didn't get to.|sd
B|I, at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in a, in a longer version even though it was a long movie.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|It's sort of the uncut version.|sd
B|At least that was some of the rumors.|h
B|We'll have to see, because it's, uh, there was some talk about that.|sd
B|I,|%
B|maybe it will come out this fall.|sd
B|There,|%
B|we're sort of in the middle of the summer, um, season of a lot of new movies coming out,|sd
B|but then there's these, um, periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again, it, uh, will increase the revenues from the movie.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, um, what movies are showing down there now?|qw
B|Oh, I, I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.|sd
B|My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them, uh,|sd
B|I keep track of them a little,|sd
B|but, you know, ask me to name the ten that are out there right now,|sd
B|and I'd have to say, uh, I, uh, I don't know.|sd
B|I, I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go|sd
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's pretty much what I do.|sd
A|I, I know for sure that that one about,|sd
A|what was that one about Bob?|qw
B|Uh, it's kind of, WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB?|sd
A|I think it's just,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think it's just playing now up here.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because some of them, they, uh, they'll start in one area of the country,|sv
B|and if they it's,|%
A|In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.|sv
B|Do you?|^g
B|Why?|qw
A|Why?|qw
A|Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.|sv
B|You think the problem is not enough doctors?|qy
A|I think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your uh, I mean, on your liability.|na
B|Gosh, for one thing.|ba
A|Oh?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you think there are plenty of doctors?|qy
B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|I don't think there is a shortage of doctors|sd
B|and I do know that O B, which is my field the doctors' health the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|It's astronomical.|ba
B|Now they can't doing anything about that.|sv
B|I don't think they're in a conspiracy.|sv
B|I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|people don't sue|sv
B|People are very sue, sue conscious.|sv
A|lawyers sue.|sv
A|If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, that's probably true, too.|aa
B|But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.|sv
A|Well, sure.|ba
B|And, so,|%
A|But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.|sv
A|You know what tort theory is?|qy
B|No.|nn
A|Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Well, it, uh,|%
A|an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.|sv
B|Well,|%
A|If, if they have complications and,|sv
B|It depends.|aap_am
A|Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,|sd
A|but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.|sd
B|Well, that's true,|aa
B|they are because doctors are performing many more tests.|sv
B|Many of them are unnecessary,|sv
B|they are doing so many C sections just to prevent.|sd
A|Just to prevent a a law suit.|sv
B|Because they have all these monitors now|sd
B|and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|See, I believe that there, there is a system already in place for health care.|sd
B|So, it's terrible.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You know, they have indigent health care.|sv
A|You show up at Parkland bleeding|sd
B|You'll get it.|^2
B|That's true.|aa
B|In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And we have that happen.|sd
B|We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and at the last minute, they come to us.|sd
B|Well uh, we can't turn them away.|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I'm for that.|aa
B|I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,|sd
B|so I'd like to wipe them all out|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, I, I happen to know a few|sd
A|and I even claim one as a friend.|sd
A|He's a divorce attorney.|sd
A|But,|%
B|He better not be mine|sd
A|I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.|sv
A|But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|some they do.|sv
A|Uh, he just said,|sd
B|They stop their O B at least.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies ever.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|Right.|b
A|His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.|sd
B|That's incredible.|ba
A|And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And most of them are very sincere.|sv
B|Most of them do the best they can.|sv
A|Yeah|b
B|They are human.|sd
B|Occasionally something will go wrong.|sd
B|Well, you can be human and Catholic.|sv
A|I know you can be human and Catholic,|aa
A|but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|no|nn
A|I mean,|%
B|most of them do.|sv
B|I really believe that.|sd
B|From dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious.|sv
A|Well, you know, who is getting rich?|qw
A|Insurance companies.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|they are.|aa
A|You know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance,|sv
A|say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed|sd
A|or,|%
B|Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program.|sd
B|I'm a graduate student,|sd

A|boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b

A|What do you like to do in your spare time?|qw
B|Well, and when I have my spare time I do enjoy,|sd
A|Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days, huh.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|Uh, I do enjoy, uh, sewing,|sd
B|I hand, uh,|%
B|I do some needlepoint.|sd
A|Oh, great.|ba
B|And I, I've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law,|sd
B|but if I, uh, ever get enough spare time, he might see it one day.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And some other things I like to do are, is music and, uh, also reading.|sd
A|What kind of music?|qw
B|Well I enjoy singing.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well great.|ba
A|I enjoy music too|sd
A|and I, uh,|%
A|one thing that I like to do, uh, is sit down and play the piano.|sd
A|I can't play that well,|sd
B|Um.|b
A|I enjoy that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh,|sd
A|I really enjoy bike riding|sd
A|and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer|sd
A|so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football|sd
A|and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.|sd
A|So we're riding bicycles|sd
A|and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And uh, so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to change.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.|sd
A|I really enjoyed skiing. Uh, and a lot of outdoor activities.|sd
A|Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now,|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day|sd
A|but,|%
B|Oh yeah.|b
B|I have not had the opportunity to go skiing|sd
B|but, uh, I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it|sd
B|but uh, never did get out and ski|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|You didn't?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I never did.|sd
B|Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing|sd
B|and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places.|sd
B|I couldn't go by myself.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|That's true.|aa
B|And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.|sd
B|So|%
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|I guess that for me it was very helpful.|sd
A|My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.|sd
B|Oh yeah.|b
A|And so we, we went quite often|sd
A|and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.|sd
A|When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago|sd
A|and we would go skiing and enjoy that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have|sd
A|and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned|sd
A|and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me|sd
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|Oh yeah.|b
A|Oh yeah|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer|sd

B|Well, I  did with my older daughter|na
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|and well the first one to go.|sd
B|She still likes her piano|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she is in band.|sd
B|So, she's got lots of hobbies or, uh, activities going on.|sd
A|It sounds like her life is full too.|sv

B|No,|fc
B|I think we covered it pretty good.|fc
A|Oh, okay.|fc
A|Great.|fc
B|Thank you for calling.|fc
A|Well thank you|fc
A|and you have a nice evening.|fc
B|You too.|fc
B|Bye,|fc
B|bye.|fc
A|Bye now.|fc
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, are you a fisher person, are you?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I love to fish.|sd
B|Great.|ba
B|What kind of fishing do you do?|qw
A|Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.|sd
B|In California?|qy
A|And, yes,|ny
A|and from the banks.|sd
A|I don't like to go out on boats.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?|qw
A|Well, it, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|But, I like it all except, uh, really I don't, I don't really care that much for the trout.|sd
A|I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout|sd
B|Well, I, I don't blame you.|sd
B|I grew up in Nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River|sd
B|and then, uh, we moved to, uh, South Dakota and, uh, did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing|sd
B|but, uh, I still, uh, I am sort of a catfish man at heart.|sd
A|See. Well, uh, like in, uh, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?|qy
B|Yep.|ny
B|Yeah,|ny
B|they do.|sd
A|You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads|sd
A|and that's,|%
A|they look just like baby catfish.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?|qy
B|Oh yeah.|ny
B|I like to fish.|sd
B|The only problem is I just moved to Texas|sd
B|so it's been a little over a year now|sd
B|but, uh I, I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and it's driving me crazy|sd
B|but, uh, one of these days, I will go over to, uh, Lake Lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?|qy
B|Well, yeah,|ny
B|sure.|sd
A|Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,|sv
B|Well|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.|sd
B|Uh, and you're right.|aa
B|I mean I like to fish for trout|sd
B|and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters|sd
B|but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I know.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish|qy
B|or do you fillet them out,|qrr
B|how  do you, how do you,|qw
A|We, uh,  skin them.|sd
B|Do you?|^g
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Okay.|bk
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|Just cut their heads off and skin them|sd
A|and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't put that corn meal on them.|sd
B|No.|nn
A|You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them|sd
A|so|%
B|Well, that's how we do it too.|sd
B|Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out|sd
B|and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish|sd
B|and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and then the skin just basically scrapes right off|sd
B|and, uh,|%
B|and it really tastes pretty good.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.|sd
B|There, uh,|%
A|Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel|sd
B|but, uh so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines|sd
A|Um.|b
B|so,|%
A|Wouldn't that be something?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike|sd
B|and, uh, they really, uh,|%
B|in, in,|%
B|when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,|sd
B|but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So when you were,|sd
A|when you did go fishing where did you go?|qw
A|You moved there from where?|qw
A|Nebraska?|^g
B|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Yeah.|ny
A|So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the lakes I suppose, huh?|qy^d
B|In, In Nebraska?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|Uh, yeah.|ny
B|Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,|sd
B|so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so we would do a lot of fishing there too|sd
B|but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for,|sd
A|Afternoon, Doug,|fp
A|it certainly is, uh, going to be a pleasure to chat with you.|fp
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I'm, uh, certainly was surprised to, uh, to hear from you.|sd
A|Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|me too.|aa
A|How did you get on this list?|qw
B|Uh, through Nancy Dahlgren.|sd
B|She, um, she had somehow gotten the information from T I and was distributing it around.|sd
A|Well, okay.|bk
A|All right.|b
A|Well, now, what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy?|qw
A|What ideas do you have on that, Doug?|qo
B|Um, see, I'm not sure that,|%
B|I don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country,|sd
B|but I think that the opportunity is definitely there for, um, people to invade your privacy when they want to,|sv
B|I think it's, um,|%
A|In what manner?|qw
B|Well, it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.|sd
B|It's completely trivial to, for instance, listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone, since they're just radio signals.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's, um,|%
B|and let's see,|^h
B|well, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?|qo
A|Well, the thing that I thought they were, uh, concerned about was, was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and in reality in many cases, they knew, or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations.|sd
A|And I thought was, uh, beginning to invade the privacy of people, because the things about where you live and, and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business,|sd
A|and they in return, come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge.|sd
A|To me that's an invasion of privacy.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I agree with you there, for sure.|aa
B|Um, and I think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get.|sv
B|It's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history, for instance, if they just, um, twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's, you know, possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change it if he wants to.|sv
A|You mean your history in regards to, uh the charge card company or something like that?|br
B|Well, um.|%
B|Well, yes,|ny
B|well, for instance, yes, um,|ny
B|and they'll probably goes into other things, like, you know, your records with the government or utility companies or anything.|sd
A|Do you consider these serious, uh, problems?|qy
B|Um, uh, not, not yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread enough,|ng
B|but I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, what should we do about it,|qw
A|or what could be done about it, do you think to correct it?|qrr
B|Um I'm not really sure, because the, I mean society is going more and more electronic,|sv
B|and there are certainly benefits to its doing so,|sv
B|and it's hard to, hard to say whether the, um, risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not,|sd
B|and I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't.|sd
B|Why,|qw
B|do you see any out for us?|qy
A|Well, I would think that, uh, information held on records, uh, by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and, and not be allowed to be, uh, to, given out by those companies.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, it should be made a, a, uh, national or a state law to protect people so that, uh, you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, uh, and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else, uh, you know, from the outside, so to speak then you would, you would feel more free to, uh, to go into detail with them|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|I.|%
A|but, but we have no control of that now|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, uh, you, you're, when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you, you feel that it someday might be used against you.|sv
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.|qo
B|Well.|%
A|What do you think would be required, and so forth?|qo
B|Uh, I'll tell you,|^h
B|I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,|qy^d
B|and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,|sd
B|and|%
A|Oh, you knew of the homes, then.|qy
B|Pardon?|br
A|You knew of the homes themselves?|qy
B|Well, I,|%
B|no,|nn
B|I'm not familiar with those homes per se|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
B|but, um, they were in the area where I live uh,|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,|sd
B|so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,|sd
B|I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know and made sure that they were cared for,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and,|%
A|Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.|qw
A|I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it|bf
B|Uh-huh.|aa
A|and, of course, that makes sense,|ba
A|but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?|qo
B|Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,|arp_nd
B|and she's eighty-seven|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I know how she feels about it.|sd
B|You know, if I, uh if I ever had to put her there, I think, uh, it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, you know, if I she got to the point where she was totally bedridden, and, and I mean, I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think that would be the,|sd
A|Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?|qo
A|Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?|qy
B|Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.|ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Is she,|%
B|I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,|sd
B|I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.|sd
A|It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,|qy
A|isn't it?|^g
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I think that's very true.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.|sv
A|It is different.|sv
B|Uh.|b
A|I had that almost similar situation.|sd
A|My mother lives in an apartment with my sister|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer,|sd
A|that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,|sd
A|and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled to have her here with me,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,|sd
A|and they, they find they, they are,|sd
A|in speaking they,|%
A|I don't know,|h
A|my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,|sd
A|and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.|sd
A|So that's, that's kind of bad news.|ba
A|And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,|sd
A|and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years|sd
B|Um.|b
A|and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|She's relatively happy,|sd
A|but she doesn't like the food.|sd
A|And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her.|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,|sv
B|and then go to something like that.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|after all, their, their life is so totally different|sv
A|because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean, you raised your own chickens,|sd
A|and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,|sd
A|and then they they had to store the meat in, uh,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't want to say barns,|sd
A|but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know to cure it and so forth.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,|sd
A|it tastes differently.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|I'm ready|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Why don't you go ahead and start off|ad
A|Okay,|aa
A|well, I don't have an elderly person that I could send to a, a nursing home or anything.|sd
A|My, both of my parents are dead,|sd
A|but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home, uh, like a nursing home|sd
A|and I went there very often to visit her and, uh, made me feel really sad.|sd
A|If I did have a mother living, I don't think I could do that.|sd
A|I think they would be better off being at home with their family, you know.|sv
B|I agree, although, we're in that situation right now.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have a, an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently.|sd
B|And even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we have several young children|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they about drive her crazy.|sd
A|Oh, I can believe that.|ba
A|Yes,|%
A|because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that.|sv
A|In a situation like that maybe it would be better.|sv
B|Well, we've, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because, again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and I think she would really resent it,|sd
B|and I think that would make it very hard.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, on the other hand, I see my wife with,|sd
B|I guess our youngest one now is five|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself.|sd
B|She needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh|b
A|see, now that's, that's, that's really a sad situation.|sv
B|And so the drain on the family.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|really, you know.|aa
B|And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always saying, you know, why do they have to be here,|sd
B|why can't they send them home,|^q
B|it's too noisy|^q
B|and she'll say that to the kids' friends.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|right,|b
A|right.|b
B|So it's a hard situation, either way, I think.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where,|sv
B|I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with.|sd
B|When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances|qh
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and,|%
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|but the cost of these nursing homes are so, You know,|sv
B|Oh, prohibitive.|^2
A|a lot of people can't afford that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, so you really have no choice that way if you, you know, if you're not rich or you know.|sv
A|Uh, I know this lady that, you know, that was a friend of mine,|sd
A|now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there, you know,|sd
A|and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So,|%
B|I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that's more readily available, you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think if we could send her someplace for the day and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|then bring her back home at night.|^2
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah,|aa
A|you know, just come home for dinner|sv
A|and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that|sv
A|but,|%
B|But there's not many of those available right now|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and they're very hard to get them into|sv
B|and we tried sending her to a senior citizen center.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she can't participate in.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
A|um.|b
B|But I think it's an issue that, you know,|sv
B|with the graying of America, we're really going to have to, as a, as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because it is a difficult situation|sv
B|and, you know, you hate seeing them just, sort of send off and not well cared for.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that, well, I can see, maybe a nursing home would be better, you know.|sv
B|And yet,|%
A|But if they, they have their wits about them and everything, why, it's kind of hard|sv
B|And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too, you know,|sv
B|if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Well, uh, my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that|sd
A|and, uh, luckily, I mean, she lived by herself|sd
A|and then, you know, one day she had a heart attack|sd
A|and she was gone,|sd
A|so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that,|sd
A|but there's, so many of us kids, there was like seven of us that, my, we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of us, you know, for a a a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow, nor the same state|sd
A|so,|%
B|Do you live at all close to each other?|qy
A|Uh, I, I have a couple more that live out here in California,|no
A|but then I have a|sd
A|So, how do you feel about the metric system?|qo
B|Oh, I like it.|sd
B|I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile.|sd
B|And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters,|sd
B|I was trying to build a shed|sd
B|and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches|sd
B|and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ...|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and it's,|%
A|I forget how many millimeters.|sd
A|So you used the metric?|qy
B|Well, no.|nn
B|What we did was wind up using,|sd
B|and you just go, you just go down|sd
B|and, and you get out the, the, so many inches|sd
B|and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward|sd
B|but had it been millimeters, you could have done.|sd
B|I think what's interesting,|%
B|the way engineering people do is they,|sd
B|they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches.|sd
A|Uh, yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?|qy
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|yeah.|ny
A|Uh, I work in metal fab|sd
A|and tenths of inches are, are normal.|sd
A|And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch.|sd
B|Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ...|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|I am.|sd
A|I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle|sd
A|and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years|sd
A|and the metric system comes easy to me.|sd
A|But my  ...|%
B|I think  it's interesting you you know, when you go out there|sv
B|and you're looking for a wrench|sv
B|and you want the next size larger.|sv
B|I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch.|sv
B|But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven|sv
B|and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ...|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|and, and you've got to go over there and try it|sv
B|and I suppose, you know, I need a larger one.|sv
B|I need a smaller one.|^q
B|I mean obviously you can look at it and say well, anyway.|sv
B|I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't,|sv
B|I don't know,|h
B|do you, do you drink adult beverages?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I drink beer.|sd
B|have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um,  a lot of  ...|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|whiskey  is in liters.|^2
B|Yes.|aa
A|And, and the next,|%
A|yeah,|%
A|point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven  five liters,|sd
A|yeah.|%
B|It's like a fifth,  like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|What's a fifth of whiskey?|qh
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I, I always  wondered about that myself.|sd
B|It was a marketing ploy.|sv
A|And, and they had quarts at the same time though.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five|sv
B|and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|it's, uh, I find that interesting.|sv
A|It's ...|%
B|But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles|sd
A|Liters.|^2
B|and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|It, it's,  like I say, I work in a machine shop|sd
A|and, uh, everything's still inches.|sd
A|Everything's  still fractions of inches,  or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ...|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It's, it's hard to think  though.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|it is a mental thing.|sv
A|It is a conversion thing.|sv
B|It's like a mill, you know.|sv
B|We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on on semiconductor devices.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And well, what's a mill|qh
B|and ...|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric.|sd
A|We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.|sd
A|And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.|sd
B|Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,|qy
B|for why, why, why pieces,|%
B|could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't.|qy
A|Uh, okay.|b
A|The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|And the starter was Bosch American,|sd
A|so.|%
B|The bolts were, were were, were English then.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|It was, it was annoying.|sd
A|One, one half of the starter you know, three bolts on the starter|sd
A|and two of them were American|sd
A|and one of them was metric.|sd
B|Now that's strange.|ba
A|And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator|sd
A|and on the water pump, it was all metric.|sd
A|And, and on, you know, the factory fittings,  you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator  hose clamps.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Essentially  they do that though|sv
B|because if, if you look at General Motors, the size|sv
B|and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler.|sv
B|If they all went, if they all went metric,|%
B|but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something,  uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|or, or you or you got your calipers there|sv
B|and, and you measure, you know,|sv
B|you mic it to see if it's accurate|sv
B|and.|%
A|Right.|aa
A|It's it's not a problem either way.|sv
B|No.|aa
A|Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And you go to look at it|sv
A|and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, and, you're never quite sure,|sv
A|well, is that a metric bolt.|^q
B|You get you a pair of metric pliers, right|qy
A|Right,|na
A|right.|na
B|And you beat on it|qy^d
B|and a metric hammer|qy^d
A|It, it can be annoying|sv
A|and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go.|qy^d
B|Oh, I think, I don't think so.|sv
B|I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,|sv
B|because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know.|sv
B|It's a hundred meter.|sv
A|Oh, absolutely.|aa
B|And, uh, uh, but automobile races|%
B|if it,|%
B|I don't think they'd ever,|sv
B|it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.|qy^d
B|They're not going to ...|qy^d
A|Yeah,|ny
A|Yeah.|ny
A|They're not going to change that to meters.|sd
A|It will always be.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,|sv
B|you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold.|sv
B|How many ounces of gold, you know.|qw
A|Twelve.|sd
B|I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something.|sd
B|It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header.|sd
B|And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Now that makes, you know.|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|And, and is that going to change too?|qh
B|Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton|sd
B|and then there's a ton.|sd
B|But what's a metric ton?|qw
A|Uh,|%
B|I don't know.|sd
A|I don't remember.|no
A|I, I read it.|sd
A|And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And, and then, but then the medicine.|sd
B|And, and some of these other things|sd
B|and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,|sd
B|milliliter.|sd
A|It's all metric  all ready.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And, and so, um, but, but when you go to order a drink, um, you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's uh ...|sd
A|And what will a shot be?|qw
A|Will a shot be an ounce?|qy
B|I don't know.|no
B|And, and, but, you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, you know, well this box is, is, uh, is, is twelve ounces|sv
B|and, and this one's, uh, uh, three pounds, um,|^q
B|and you  ...|%
A|And the  other one's two point one kis,|sv
A|and, and you're, you're lost.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|And, and I don't know.|h
B|I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone.|sv
B|I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|The economy.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. Uh,|sd
A|a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.|sv
A|Personal tools to be able to do his job.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|But, but are, are the tools that, uh,|%
B|if you're cutting,|%
B|are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for for set up?|qy
A|Uh, tools for set up and for measurement.|sd
A|Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,|sv
A|it's a hundred dollars. Uh,|sv
A|five tenths uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. Uh,|sv
B|Huh.|b
A|five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.|sv
A|You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars.|sv
A|You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,|sv
A|one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.|sv
A|A two to three for eighty dollars.|sv
A|A three to four for eighty dollars.|sv
B|So you've got thousands of dollars or so.|bf
B|I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.|bf
A|Real fast.|aa
B|Yes.|b
A|Real, real fast.|aa
A|Edge finders and ...|%
B|But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ...|%
A|Well, I know,|aa
A|because, okay.|%
A|Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know.|qh
B|But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,|sv
B|I need a hole there.|^q
A|What size hole?|qh
B|Yeah.|b
A|As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?|qh
B|Yeah.|aa
B|And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws|sv
B|and that's the other issue.  Uh,|sv
B|the pitch and  ...|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Well and thread,|sv
A|Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,|sd
A|but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie.|sd
B|I haven't seen that yet.|sd
B|I, I, I hear,|%
B|we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it.|sd
B|It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess.|sd
B|So we're going to go see that.|sd
B|But you enjoyed that?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|it's, it's something that, uh,|sd
A|my brother lives over in Fort Worth,|sd
A|and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,|sd
A|and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video.|sd
A|And I said, no,|sd
A|this is not one that you want to do that with.|^q
B|That's what I heard,|sd
B|yeah.|%
A|It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen.|sd
A|It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,|sd
A|it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|it's one I think,|%
A|but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,|sv
A|this is my favorite movie.|^q
A|Well, this is the one for me this time.|sd
B|Really.|bh
A|Yeah.|ny
A|What have you been to lately?|qw
B|Um, let's see.|^h
B|Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny.|sd
B|I was just um,|sd
B|friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal, because, uh, we're both big karate fans.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|So we wanted to see what this is like.|sd
B|And, uh, impressed with actually.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,|sd
B|and I just think he's pretty good.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, this movie,|%
B|I'm convinced now he can act.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|How's his karate?|qw
B|Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good.|sd
B|I think in this one it wasn't so good.|sv
B|I generally, um,|%
B|movies like that scare me, though.|sd
B|I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up.|sv
A|Well, well they do,|aa
A|they get|sv
B|Fighting.|^2
A|I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that.|sd
A|We wanted to jump in the cars and race.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,|sd
B|so, so it was a little bit, uh,|%
B|I was thinking, Wow,|sd
B|people must be into crime movies again.|^q
B|But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point.|sd
B|Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.|qy^d
A|I did see GHOSTS.|na
B|Yeah,|b
B|and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it turned out to be an excellent movie.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it.|sd
A|I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role.|sd
B|Oh, Patrick Swayze?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|and I especially like him.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|he's very good.|sv
A|He's a really good guy.|aa
A|Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,|sd
B|Really,|b
B|I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.|sd
B|What else have we seen recently.|t1
B|Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,|qh
B|DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.|sd
A|Is that right.|bh
B|Have you heard of it?|qy
A|I've, I've seen the ads for it,|na
A|but I'm not real sure what it's about.|sd
B|Yeah, um,|b
B|I actually hadn't heard anything about it,|sd
B|and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,|sd
B|and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,|sd
B|at first they told me.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I thought, what a strange combination,|sd
B|Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.|^q
A|That is a strange combination.|aa
B|Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,|sd
B|so it's lot better.|sv
B|Mel Brooks you probably know.|qy^d
A|Yeah.|ny
B|I know,|bk
B|so it, it was a strange combination.|sv
B|But it turned out to be a very cute movie.|sd
B|I mean, the whole premise is that they go out|sd
B|and, and they die|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|and they have to,|sd
A|Both of them.|qy^d
B|Right.|na
B|Both of them are dead,|sd
B|and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up.|sd
B|You know, they go|sd
B|and they decide if you can move up to the next level.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,|qy^d
B|but it's something like that.|sd
A|Yeah,|ny
A|years ago.|sd
B|They sort of move up to levels,|sd
B|and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,|sd
B|and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So you can guess the rest of the plot.|ad
B|It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And then defend it.|qy^d
B|And that's pretty good actually.|sd
A|Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then.|qy^d
B|Yeah.|ny
B|And it's|sd
B|you actually have to go up there|sd
B|and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,|sd
B|a defense and a prosecution,|sd
B|and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,|sd
B|and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know.|sd
B|It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|aa
B|I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,|sd
B|and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.|sd
B|So,|%
A|It's funny,|ba
A|we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And it kind of makes you wonder,|sv
A|I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication.|sd
A|It's the behavioral science part of communication,|sd
A|and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,|sd
A|and, uh what exactly do we, you know, do we see about this world,|qh
B|Um.|b
A|or why are we so fascinated with the other world.|qh
A|Is it supposed to be better?|qh
B|The other world,|b
B|yeah.|%
A|Sometimes I think we think it is.|sv
A|We like those things that way.|sv
B|Um, I'm, I'm sure that it seems like,|%
B|it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with ,|sv
B|but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.|sv
A|Well, it has.|aa
A|All the way through history, there's, I guess,|sv
A|if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.|sv
A|I guess because we don't know,|sv
A|and there's no real way of finding out.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|well.|%
A|There's only one way of finding it.|sv
B|Well did you ever see, um, FLATLINERS.|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I did, uh, did not.|sd
A|The girl next to me saw it,|sd
A|and she really liked it.|sd
B|That's, that's, that's probably one of those ones that, you know,|%
B|it's on video now, I think.|sd
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it is.|aa
B|Probably, probably worth seeing on video.|sv
B|Actually we really enjoyed it,|sd
B|but it was also right along the same lines.|sd
B|I mean they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|they said, she said that this was almost believable|sd
A|that could really happen.|sd
A|You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,|sv
A|and you never know.|sv
B|Almost,|aa
B|yeah,|aa
B|I, I, it's a little far fetched to, find a bunch of medical students doing it,|sv
B|but but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and they didn't just sort of make it silly.|sd
B|It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think.|sd
B|So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.|sd
A|I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,|sd
A|so then they get crazy|sd
A|and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going.|sd
B|The story sort of keeps going and going.|aa
A|Well I guess that covers our topic.|fc
B|Yeah,|fc
B|great.|fc
B|Well, it was, nice talking to you.|fc
A|Nice talking to you.|fc
A|Bye.|fc
B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Are you ready to start?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Okay|bk
B|Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?|qy
A|Well, I just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old,|arp_nd
A|and it doesn't seem like it's that old.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|Seems like I just bought it.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|It's an eighty-nine|sd
A|and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight|sd
A|so, yeah.|%
B|Well, I really, the last car we got was a, was a used car.|sd
B|I really don't prefer buying a new car.|sd
B|I like to let somebody else pay for that|sd
A|I know,|aa
A|I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.|sd
B|But, uh mine was a year old,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we bought it for very functional purposes,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that was we bought a station wagon.|sd
B|We wanted an economical car to operate,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.|sd
B|So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I've never been sorry,|sd
A|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
B|however the need for that kind of car has changed now,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, okay.|b
B|and, uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Huh.|b
B|And probably then some|sd
B|I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|I think that I would like to,|sd
B|if you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted I would either buy a Nissan Maxima, uh,|sd
A|Right.|b
B|I'm sold on Nissans.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I a or, or foreign cars actually.|sd
B|Uh,|%
A|But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?|qy
B|Uh,|^h
A|Is that how you,|qy
A|I have never,|%
B|its reliability.|qy
A|Its|%
B|Its reliability.|sd
B|And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things,|sd
B|and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars.|sd
B|If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.|sd
A|Isn't that a shame.|bh
B|But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.|sd
A|My word isn't that sorry.|bh
A|That's sorry.|ba
B|Uh, you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.|sd
A|My word.|ba
B|And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.|sd
A|Oh, mercy.|ba
B|So,|%
A|You,|%
B|and that was just trying to hold us,|sd
B|getting out of that was a used car.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|And it was an older car,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|but, you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales.|sv
A|Huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's just, it just was not|sd
B|and you get stung a time or two,|sv
A|Sure.|aa
B|and you say, no thanks.|sv
A|No thanks.|b^m
A|That's right.|aa
B|So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto, uh, reports|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly,|sd
B|and he gave me four choices of cars to buy|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|An Escort definitely was not among them.|sd
B|In fact, there wasn't an American car in there.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|Uh, the Nissan came|sd
B|and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it served our needs.|sd
B|Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for.|sd
B|And that, and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac.|sd
B|I really would.|sd
B|It's not necessarily prestige,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's comfort.|sv
B|Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car.|sv
B|Uh,|%
A|Who makes that car?|qw
B|Nissan.|sd
A|I mean but where are they, where are they,|qw
A|what, what is their location,|qw

B|uh-huh,|ny
A|Okay,|bk
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I didn't know.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Okay|b
B|I mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I guess so|aa
A|that's true.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
B|Now what about you,|qo

A|If, if, if I had the car I wanted.|^h

A|Gee.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b

A|uh-huh.|b
B|But if I had the little red C R X , I guess the interior would have to be black leather|sd

A|I, I do a fair amount of cooking.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b

A|I probably do that about once a month.|sd
A|And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you know,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|How about you?|qo
B|Yeah,|b
B|those are things I like the most.|sd
B|I like fish and chicken the most.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|And, uh, most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.|sd
A|Uh.|b
B|Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it.|sd
B|And then I just, uh, you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I made scallops the other night,|sd
A|that was unusual,|sd
A|and, uh, basically, uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave|sd
A|and you sprinkled, uh, you swished around a little melted butter and do, uh, oh I do not know, microwaved them for about nine minutes.|sd
A|No,|ar
A|no,|ar
A|four and a half to five minutes|sd
A|and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,|sd
A|very simple, but very nice.|sd

B|Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.|b
A|Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.|b^m
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, my husband liked it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, no|b
A|unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, uh, fish items.|sv

B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|uh-huh.|ny
A|Do you have any particular places you like going?|qy
B|Oh, there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I like that,|sd
B|it's just, it's just home cooking.|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|I have been there.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, it's kind of, kind of like Black Eye Pea,|sd
A|but I do not think it's a chain.|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|exactly,|aa
B|uh-huh,|aa
B|and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|So, I do not really like, uh, you know, uh, uh, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,|sd
B|or I do not like greasy places.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I do not feel like they are very healthy,|sv
A|and I always, feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, go to them.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|and I, and I got, uh, chicken marinara the last two times.|sd
A|Oh, how was it?|qw
B|It was, uh, it was great.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|Because that's, that's what I like,|sd
B|I do not like it, you know. I just like a baked, you know, a piece of chicken|sd
B|and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know.|qh
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I tend to, uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, uh, I like experimenting on, on food|sd
A|and sometimes I go for fairly exotic things.|sd
A|And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe|sd
A|and it was just a total bust.|sd
A|I was, sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way back.|sd
B|He tried to make bagels one time.|sd
A|Oh my that's ambitious.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and, uh, we took some|sd
B|and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,|sd
B|and we took some and gave it to the dogs,|sd
B|and the dog never, you know, he treated it like a milk bone|sd
B|and he never did finish it.|sd
A|Um.|b
B|He just barely made a dent in it.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, and, uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's, uh, supposed to be candy.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,|sd
B|it was, you know. It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, uh, into a kind of a candy stick,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, uh.|%
A|Huh, see I am not,|%
A|that's interesting.|ba
A|One of the things I do not make is dessert.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.|sd
A|And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Huh.|b
A|Uh, everything else was fine,|sd
A|but that was a fiasco.|sd
B|Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.|qy

A|Uh, yeah.|ny
B|Yeah,|b^m
B|just about.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Use about half the sugar,|ad
B|or make everything diet.|ad
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Uh, do you cook for yourself|qy
A|or do you cook for others?|qrr
B|Mostly, I just cook for myself.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And,|%
B|It's easy,|sv
B|that's for sure.|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|b^m
A|Oh, yeah.|aa
A|And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,|sd
A|if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I always put cheese on them.|sd
A|And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,|sv
B|it's mostly starch.|sv
B|So, it fills you up|sv
B|and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.|sv
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I I did not say it was nourishing,|sd
A|but it was satisfying.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|it really is.|aa
A|And,|%
B|Then you have to make a salad|sv
B|or,|%
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah|aa
A|but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,|sd
A|so I ate very simply.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.|sd
A|I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh,|%
B|Except you get to taste the product instead .|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|and have an explosion.|sv
B|Fill them up|sv
B|or blow up.|sv
A|Sometimes it blows up anyway.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.|sd
A|And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe|sd
A|and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,|sd
A|and it does turn to toffee inside the can.|sd
B|Oh, yeah|b
A|And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.|sd
A|It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.|sd
A|And, and the boy friend thought,|sd
A|it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,|sd
A|so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang|sd
A|and there he was.|sd
A|And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Did you let the can cool off?|qy
A|Uh, I really do not remember,|no
A|that was about ten years ago,|sd
A|I just remember how embarrassing it was.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before|sd
A|and I never had that problem,|sd
A|just that one time.|sd
B|Huh. Yeah.|b
A|And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,|sd
A|he was kind of pushy too.|sd
A|Acted like, he came from San Francisco|sd

A|Not for the price?|qy^d

A|Health food, uh, restaurants that,|sd

B|name one|ad
A|Well well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.|aa
B|I'm not sure what you're talking about.|sd

A|and they list them.|sd
A|Now there's one restaurant that does that|sd

A|over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.|sd
B|Huh.|b

B|Maybe, maybe that.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa

A|And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,|sd

A|Well, they have lunch specials that|%
A|you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Probably that's true.|aa
B|But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,|sv
A|Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast|sd
A|and it was excellent.|sd
A|It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast|sd

B|Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?|qw
A|Oh, it was,|sd
B|That's one of my husband's pet peeves.|sd
B|He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.|sd
A|Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north|sd

B|Oh, really?|bh
A|And I haven't gotten over that from the north.|sd
B|Oh, catfish is wonderful.|sv
A|I know they say that, that is,|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish|sd
B|Really.|b
A|and so I kind of stay|sd
B|Why?|qw
A|Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.|sv
B|Oh.|bk
B|Huh.|b
A|and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.|sd
B|That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it|sd
A|I,|%
A|Well, yeah.|b
A|So I am,|%
A|and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|So I'm, I, you know, I,|%
B|Oh, on one hand I see that|sd
B|and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Corrode.|^2
A|Huh.|b
B|So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then they take these things that will rust|sd
B|and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.|sd
A|Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|And then they wouldn't think.|sd
B|They were floating around|sd
B|so they shot holes in them to sink them.|sd
A|Oh, dear.|ba
B|And this is before I was born.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,|sd
A|Sure.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|Everything we eat.|sv
A|Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it|sv
B|You can't get away from it|sv
B|so I think, To some point,|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|yeah,|b^m
B|you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know,|sv
B|this is not in my control.|sv
A|Well, you know,|%
B|So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death|sv

B|Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know  the cash  with me all the time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,|sd
B|and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Absolutely.|b
A|Right.|b
B|And so that's why I went ahead and got one.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It was a mistake|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't use them very often.|sd
A|Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,|sd
A|and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|just enough to keep them active.|sd
A|My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could make the transaction over the telephone,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, and it saves a lot time.|sd
A|And that's what I was using it for.|sd
A|However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,|sd
A|you must have the money to do this with,|^q
A|and you do not have any other options|^q
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I charged all three of those cards up,|sd
A|and right now I am paying and praying.|sd
B|I know how that goes|ba
A|But, uh,|%
B|and that's exactly what we've, I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them, because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we had no way around it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance on a card|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
B|and so like you were paying for it,|sd
B|but it's one of those I'm glad it was there.|sd
A|Well, I never did, Right.|sd
A|I never did use it for an advance.|sd
A|Most of my charges were, uh, medications.|sd
B|Oh, I see.|b
A|Didn't have cash for the medications|sd
A|or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, a lot of times you can get by using those for, uh, uh,|sv
A|different labs will use those charge accounts for,|sv
B|What,|%
B|Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?|qy
B|I've found some doctors that say, you know,|^h
B|I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,|^h
B|and so many of them don't anymore.|na
A|Uh-huh|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, I have not,|%
A|like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I don't generally charge.|sd
A|I say well, I need a checkup in six months,|sd
A|and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,|sd
A|and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.|sv
B|Oh, it is|aa
A|It is easy,|sv
A|and it's very difficult to get out.|sv
A|I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.|sd
B|I know.|aa
A|I say wow,|sd
A|I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.|^q
A|Big deal,|^q
A|I'm saving two percent.|^q
B|Right.|b
B|But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A|sd
B|and you got all your interest, you know towards your tax deductions,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,|sv
B|and I, I think about young people that think, you know,|sv
B|there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,|sv
B|I have my first credit card|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|aa
A|and it's not just paying back what you've charged,|sv
B|You know.|qh
A|it's paying that and half again.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars,|sv
A|you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|You only get half of that paid for the principal,|sv
A|so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|and that's frightening to me.|sv
A|Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's frightening, too.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I work for T I|sd
B|but he doesn't|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers crossed.|sd
B|I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,|sd
B|and after ten years he's got two of them|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they should pay through next month,|sd
B|and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.|sd
A|Oh, right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And, you know, just in one lump,|sd
B|because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
B|or it's like you say,|sv
B|you pay forever.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
B|And so I'm really looking forward to that.|sd
A|Well, you either need a big chunk of money|sv
A|or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum payment.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
A|Now, those are very handy|sv
B|Right.|b
A|if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good no problem|sv
B|Sure,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.|sd
B|That's right|aa
A|But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money|sd
B|I know|aa
B|and,|%
A|And it just irks me.|sd
A|I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,|sd
A|and I've got three cards.|sd
A|I've lost a whole day of my life to interest.|sd
B|I know.|aa
B|You're like what am I working for today|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|And that just blows my mind.|sd
A|I, my house is paid for,|sd
A|my car is paid for,|sd
A|I've got some home improvements,|sd
A|but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.|sd
B|It's incredible.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Boy, I wish I could say that my house and,|sd
B|well, my car is paid for now.|sd
B|It was wrecked three weeks ago,|sd
B|but, but you see again the credit cards came in handy.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|I think that is a good, healthy, safe use of credit cards.|sv
B|And, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
A|Uh, I went to a seminar,|sd
A|they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.|sd
A|You only use credit cards for investments.|^q
B|Right.|b
A|I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to you know, if I could do some investing, you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card.|sd
B|It's,|%
B|Sure.|b
B|That's right.|aa
A|That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.|sv
A|I thought God dang, where is his pencil?|sd
B|That's right.|aa
B|Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,|sv
B|don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card you know,|sv
A|That's right.|aa
B|and, and so that, that is the smart half.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,|sd
B|but it was no biggie you know, because we could pay it off,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,|sv
B|so we cut that out real quick|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, but I, I do like having them there.|sd
B|There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or common sense not, not to get yourself in trouble.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh|b
A|You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Seem to have the topic already on top of tip of your tongue there|sv
A|so why don't you go ahead and start.|ad
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Isn't the, uh, the subject auto repair, for tonight?|qy
A|Yes, sir.|ny
B|Yeah.|%
B|That's great.|ba
B|The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car|sd
B|and, that's something I like to do and, uh, something I, something I can do with now the sophisticated auto, cars we have today with all the computers and everything.|sd
A|Okay.|b
A|Right,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
B|It's, uh, and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car,|sv
B|but I do like to get out and tinker with a car|sd
B|and it's something I can do still.|sd
B|Do you enjoy working with your car?|qy
A|I sure do.|na
A|I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't even remember what it is.|sd
A|I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex, where we are not allowed to, work on our vehicle.|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|We can't even wash our vehicle,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Oh, that's too bad.|ba
A|Uh, but the last thing I can remember doing|sd
A|I had a sixty-six Mustang,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess.|sd
B|Oh, yes.|aa
A|And, uh, you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still,|sd
A|and, uh, I didn't tinker too much with the engine.|sd
A|It was, it was in pretty good shape,|sd
A|but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And, uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, uh,|sd
A|but it was fun.|sd
A|It was taking the whole thing, you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering new carpeting and, uh,|sd
B|And did you install all that yourself?|qy
A|Right.|na
B|Well, that was, I bet that was a lot of fun.|qy^d
A|And,|%
A|It, it was.|na
A|I, my wife enjoyed, uh, she, you know, helped out a little.|sd
A|We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels. And painted, those and,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Wow.|ba
B|Do you still have the car?|qy
A|No,|nn
A|I sold it.|sd
B|Well, that's too bad.|ba
B|A sixty-seven uh, Mustang is about the, uh, top, top year for the Mustang car.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it was fun though.|sd
A|It was fun.|sd
A|I, I really enjoyed it,|sd
A|and I was surprised at, at, uh, the availability of parts yet.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts.|sd
B|Huh.|%
A|But, uh, you pay a premium|sd
A|but you just don't get them.|sd
A|I, I didn't.|sd
A|I went ahead and got, you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made,|sd
A|Canada.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, prefabs and all that stuff|sd
A|but,|%
B|Well, you know, that's, that's fine.|ba
B|I, I don't think that there would be, uh, you know, a, a quality difference.|sv
B|I don't know.|h
B|You wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you?|qy
A|Well, actually there was.|arp_nd
B|Oh.|bk
A|And, uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns, uh, exactly.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so like the, the glove box was just a little, little wider, little harder to fit in,|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|and the carpeting, uh, stretched a little too far.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I had to cut some of the sides down.|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|But just, just little things.|sd
A|You know, one of the screws on, on the door uh, window regulators|sd
A|you could get three of the, three of the four to lineup.|sd
A|The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.|sd
B|Oh, I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?|qy
A|You know,|%
A|Oh, it was|na
A|but, the end result is after you put your, your panels on, nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your, your window regulator anyway|sd
A|and, it, it runs. It works just the same,|sd
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|so.|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's, that's true.|aa
B|Well, you know, that, that is something I really enjoy doing. Um, working on our car too,|sd
B|the, uh, I just changed my oil, oil tonight|sd
B|but, uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes|sd
B|and, uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car.|sd
B|And, uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on those kind of things.|sd
A|Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem|sd
A|but I, I honestly don't have the tools for the drum.|sd
A|I know you got, uh, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Spoons and,|^2
B|Yes,|aa
B|you do|aa
A|Uh, my dad has got all that|sd
A|and, and I, I helped him when I was growing up,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but I don't have that stuff now,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take them in.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
B|And, you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too|sv
B|because, um, I was helping my neighbor out|sd
B|and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced|sd
B|and I don't have, of course, the equipment to do that,|sd
A|Sure.|b
B|so he took it into a shop and had it uh, resurfaced and, and fixed that way.|sd
B|But, yeah,|%
B|it is true, uh, you know,|sv
B|I did have a sixty-four Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it, because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff, that's in there now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'll tell you what.|^h
A|The other, the nicest thing about them is, uh, everything was standard.|sd
A|You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Boy, I tell you.|^h
B|And you know,|%
A|So, are you a news person?|qy
B|Uh, I really am,|na
B|I enjoy, I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can. Although, you know, I'm a full time student|sd
B|and I work full time, too,|sd
B|so, or not full time,|sd
B|but I work quite a bit|sd
B|and so so I mostly depend on the radio, you know, on the way to work.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|I like, I like to listen to national public radio, uh, all things considered.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|great show.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and I like to listen to that and catch, you know,|sd
B|I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day.|sd
B|But,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|so, so the real, the real current news and, the hard news is, is not, there is not really enough of it there.|bf
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Right,|aa
B|that's right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Yeah,|b^m
A|I've had, I've had that frustration, too.|sd
A|I end up switching stations from time to time.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|you, you you like N P R uh, programming?|qy
A|Uh, in general.|na
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I watch a lot of C N N uh, and C SPAN.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I, I subscribe to three newspapers.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, and I, when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have. Of world, world events and national events.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation?|qw
B|Well we we, we have a, a big newspaper situation.|sd
B|Uh, because, we used to have two newspapers up until, uh, last Sunday|sd
B|and a, uh, major, uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down.|sd
B|They closed shop, and said, well, we can't put any more papers out,|sd
B|we're done.|^q
A|Was, was that the, the better paper|qy
A|or  ,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I thought so.|sd
B|It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned.|sd
B|It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy. Uh, which I like.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section.|sd
B|I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening pretty quick.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|And I feel that the other newspaper, uh,|%
B|the the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.|sd
B|The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, is okay,|sv
B|but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion|sd
B|and,|%
A|But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES rather, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|No,|nn
B|no,|nn
B|that's the problem.|sv
A|Oh.|bk
B|But, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know.|sv
A|Whoever Troy Aikman is.|qw^d
B|Yeah,|b
B|a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|Uh, you know, you know, you know what I mean|qw
A|Yeah.|ny
B|that, there is, uh, local news that, uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, uh,|%
A|I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right,|aa
B|yeah|aa
B|Not something you'll, you'll, uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means. You know.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|How, how about you?|qo
B|Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don't you?|qy
A|Yes.|ny
A|A lot of them.|sd
A|I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, and, uh, each of them covers different things in, in in different ways|sv
B|Right.|b
A|and so it's, you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different clearly would have a different perspective on the world.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
B|Uh, I, I have a question.|sd
B|Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh,|qy
B|I, I've kind of gathered lately that, uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business.|sv
B|Is that, is that a correct assumption?|qy
A|That, that is certainly true.|na
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, they will, they will have articles,|sd
A|like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, you know theory of relativity. You know, that started on the front page ran in, into the full, almost full page inside.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Oh.|bk
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Now, these are feature kind of articles.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|All the, all the, uh, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|But, but there is some very good other articles uh, you'll find in the, in the JOURNAL.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you find that you're, uh, uh, disappointed or pleased with, uh, uh, the performance of like network coverage of news?|qy
A|Uh, I wish it were in more depth.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer,|sd
A|just more facts would be nice.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, C N N has, has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
A|Uh, and they were, you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, but, you know, it's not, it's never quite,|%
A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|I don't,|sd
B|You don't?|bh
A|but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
B|So. Well, I have two daughters|sd
B|and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,|sd
B|and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.|sd
B|Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect.|ad
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.|%
B|Well, if I were|%
A|Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Exactly.|aa
B|Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|I would think someone older|sd
A|and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b^m
B|And I think that varies.|sv
B|I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|that's true also.|aa
B|Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.|sd
A|I'm twenty-two now|sd
A|and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.|sd
A|But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,|sd
A|well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,|sd
A|but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.|sd
A|The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.|sd
B|Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up|sd
B|and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,|sv
B|I know I did this with my children,|sd
B|it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself|sd
B|so they, they thought, okay,|sd
B|she knows how to, how to treat children.|^q
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, see when, um, I first got my my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.|sd
A|Um, this lady saw us at church|sd
A|and she was a you know, she was a younger lady.|sd
A|She didn't really know my mom.|sd
A|She knew my mom by name|sd
A|and that was it.|sd
A|And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family|sd
A|so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,|sd
A|I thought that was pretty strange.|sd
A|You know, and she had two children.|sd
A|One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
A|So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.|sd
A|So, I you know, I enjoy kids|sd
A|and I get along with them very well|sd
A|so there's no problem.|sd
A|But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.|sd
B|Oh, I agree with you,|aa
B|but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So she was going on those two instincts.|sv
B|Just the same I know myself,|sd
B|I never,|%
B|and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.|sd
A|Oh, I would be too|sd
B|And, and in it really shocked me|sd
B|because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.|sd
B|She had just moved in the neighborhood.|sd
B|She had her daughter with her,|sd
B|and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.|sd
B|And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.|sd
A|Oh, my.|ba
B|And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I mean people are so different.|sv
A|Oh, I know.|aa
A|Um, well, I I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.|qy^d
B|Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half|arp_nd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I worked just a part-time job|sd
B|and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in|sd
B|and, you know, I made a few phone calls,|sd
B|I went in and visited.|sd
B|I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, that was a concern with me.|sd
B|Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there|sv
B|and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,|sv
B|and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.|sd
B|You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well,|%
B|But I,|%
B|go ahead.|ad
A|How did you stumble upon the day-care center?|qw
A|Did you just look it up in a phone book|qy
A|or what was it?|qw
B|Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think most people do that.|sv
B|I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything|sv
B|or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care|^q
B|and,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|exactly.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So there, there are just so many considerations.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?|qy
B|Oh, money is always a factor in my life, definitely.|na
B|I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.|sd
B|I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,|sd
B|but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care,|%
A|Good morning.|fp
B|Hi.|fp
A|My name is Jean.|fp
B|I'm Tina.|fp
A|Oh, where you from Tina?|qw
B|I live in Garland, Texas.|sd

B|Yeah.|ny
A|Do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
B|My husband does.|ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Probably most people you talk to do, huh?|qy
A|Most of them do.|na
A|Now, I don't have anybody that works for T I,|sd
A|but, uh my son works for a computer company, the National Institute of something,|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I don't know what|sd
B|I see,|b
B|well that's neat.|ba
A|So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I guess you have to push one, though.|ad
A|Yes,|aa
A|uh-huh.|aa
B|Okay.|b
A|You ready?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
A|Okay.|bk
A|Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I guess so,|^h
B|it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there|qy^d
A|Well, I don't know,|arp_nd
A|my brother lives down East of us down there,|sd
A|and I don't think they ate all that much different|sd
B|Oh, really.|b
A|Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,|sv
A|course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|that's true.|aa
A|Uh.|b
B|Well, uh, the thing that I found interesting,|sd
B|my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|and it's not as good as if it's fresh.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,|sd
B|but it just, didn't taste right.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.|aa
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of|sd
B|and, we drink ice tea with every meal,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|well they do in the summertime,|sv
A|I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.|sv
B|Really?|bh
B|Yeah.|b
A|Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it never gets real cold.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|So, I,|%
B|Yeah,|b
B|but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular.|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
B|Yeah.|ny
B|I know that, um, I do a lot of planning with our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish|sd
B|or. And Italian food is real big too.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.|bf
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|How about you,|qo
B|what is real popular up there?|qw
A|Well, I don't know,|no
A|just about anything|arp_nd
B|Oh, really.|bh
A|Yeah,|ny
A|we, we really, uh, use most anything.|sd
A|I, uh, I think like parties and that though are,|%
A|well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party|sd
B|Oh.|bk
A|But, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Your, uh, bread family and your,|sd
A|or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and , ham and bake potatoes, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,|sd
A|you know they been advertising that|sd
A|and, we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, that's good.|ba
A|They have a lot of vegetable to them,|sv
A|and, uh, they really are very good.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|right.|b
B|Oh, yes.|aa
B|I, I love that kind of cooking.|sd
B|My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things|sd
A|Is he a meat and potato person?|qy
B|Right.|na
B|They.|sd
A|Well, all our family is, is gone.|sd
A|They are out on their own.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh. It, it's much different|sd
B|That probably makes it easier,|sv
B|but.|%
A|and, uh.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese|sd
B|and, uh, and of course ,|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Well, my husband didn't like that,|sd
A|so we, us kids,|%
A|we had five children|sd
A|and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,|sd
B|Right.|b
A|that's what we had|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, that's pretty much what we do,|sd
B|if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese, or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, they like, uh, spaghetti.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, that's one meal, I can fix|sd
A|Uh, yeah.|b
B|and the whole family eats.|sd
B|But, uh, there are several things that,|%
B|well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.|sd
A|Oh, those always go good.|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|the children love them,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, they are real easy to cook|sv
B|and, that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and my girls don't like beef,|sd
B|I, don't know,|h
A|Oh really.|b
A|Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going.|sv
B|I guess,|h
B|Well, yeah,|aa
B|it could be, they don't,|%
B|I think it's the texture of it,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it takes more chewing|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it is easier to chew.|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Right.|aa
B|So they're not too much into beef.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|My husband and I eat more beef than we should,|sd
B|but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them|sd
A|Right.|b
A|We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I don't know if you do or not,|qy^d
A|but we, we don't a whole lot,|sd
A|we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We have a real tiny little house,|sd
B|we don't have room really, to have people here.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|But, we do get together for fellowships at our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And,|%
A|Well that's good.|ba
B|Yeah,|aa
B|it is|aa
B|and it's fun to, uh,|sd
B|I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we do a lot of that take , things to church|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and our homemakers meet at the church also,|sd
A|and, uh, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, you don't really include any certain food groups,|sd
A|you just bring, what you like|sd
B|Right.|b
B|That's right|aa
A|Sometimes you have all desserts,|sd
A|sometimes, you have all vegetables|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's true,|aa
B|that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, uh, like best.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|But, it doesn't happen very often,|sd
A|usually you get a pretty wide variety|sd
A|and you can, you can , have pretty good meals, from one of those.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|aa
B|I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.|sd
A|Oh, those are fun.|ba
B|It's the only time that ever.|%
B|Yeah|aa
B|they are.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it's the only time I can remember that,|sd
B|I can't remember what food it was|sd
B|I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.|sd
B|Several people were supposed to bring, you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer, and a main dish and a dessert.|sd
A|Uh, uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers|sd
B|and, but when we came to the main, main dish plate, there was only like two or three|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh|b
A|, Oh.|b
A|Was there enough to go around?|qy
B|Well, not really,|ng
B|you know we all took real tiny little portions, and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|we were not sure who didn't show up with the food|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually|sv
B|Yes.|aa
A|and you know they know better.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .|sv
B|Right.|aa
B|Either, either go ahead and fix your dish|sv
B|or call someone that can.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Right.|aa
B|I know it.|b
B|Well, that sounds neat,|ba
B|I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,|sd
B|but you sound so close.|sd
A|They said that we could share, we share, a recipe|sd
B|It sounds like you're here in Dallas.|sd
A|but, I'm up at my daughter's,|sd
A|I don't even have any of my recipes with me.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, you know ,|%

A|Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents?|qy
B|Unfortunately, yes.|ny
B|Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives|sd
B|and we were talking, uh,|sd
B|we had a review with the nursing home staff.|sd
B|My mother's in a nursing home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we had a review today|sd
B|and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing,|sd
A|Yes.|b
B|so, yes,|ny
B|I'm very familiar with it|sd
B|and it's not something that is, uh, you know,|sv
B|I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience.|sd
B|But I guess we all do.|sv
A|I think sooner or later, uh,|aa
A|both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes|sd
A|and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|And, uh-huh.|ny
A|And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.|sv
B|Right.|b
A|What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?|qw
B|Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.|sv
A|Yes|aa
B|Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around|sd
B|and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area|sd
B|And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like.|sd
B|But, again, it's no different than every one.|sv
B|And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month|sd
A|Um, uh-huh.|b
B|when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care.|sv
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yes.|aa
B|It's not that expensive, really.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, theirs both ran,|%
A|oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred|sd
A|and my mother's was two thousand.|sd
A|Then, this has been five years ago.|sd
A|And, uh uh, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they knew.|sd
A|And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|You know, uh-huh.|ny
A|And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh,|sd
A|we had my mother all set to go into one|sd
A|and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, I saw areas that they had not shown me|sd
A|and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me,|sd
B|Well, I'll be darned.|ba
A|so, uh, we did not put her in that one.|sd
A|We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, uh, better pleased with the situation.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|you, you know, this is the whole point.|sv
B|You've got, you've got to shop them.|sv
A|Yes,|aa
A|you do.|aa
B|I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around,|sd
B|but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it's very, very,|%
A|Does your mother have Alzheimer's?|qy
B|She,|%
B|well, who knows.|no
B|They call it, uh, dementia.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, we don't know.|no
B|I, I mean she does not know us anymore|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's, basically the same.|sd
B|And her health is not that bad.|sd
B|Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last,|sd
B|well, she had been in a retirement community|sd
B|and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.|sd
B|Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in,|sd
B|and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what kind of car are you going to buy next?|qw
B|Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car,|sd
B|but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we have another four door car that I drive to work,|sd
B|and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's true,|aa
A|that's true.|aa
B|What, what are you looking at?|qw
A|Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,|arp_nd
A|but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|Oh, yeah|b
A|But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.|sd
B|Oh, yes,|b
B|oh, yes.|b
A|But, uh.|%
B|Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the|sv
A|Right,|aa
A|they are.|aa
A|I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante.|sd
B|Oh, yes,|b
B|oh, yes.|b
A|That is a pretty car.|sv
B|I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|that's pretty, too.|sv
B|but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|they get pretty expensive.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|they do.|aa
A|The last one I bought, I bought a, uh,|sd
A|well, it's a, it's a Town Car,|sd
A|but it was a demo, returned|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.|sv
A|So I was really pleased to find that,|sd
A|and I then, I bought it for cheaper,|sd
A|I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
B|Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride.|sv
A|And the thing about it is they give you that ten, uh, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Well, that's fantastic.|ba
B|That's real, real good.|ba
A|So, uh, I have really been impressed.|sd
A|I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know.|sd
B|No,|aa
B|do you,|%
A|But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there|sd
A|and you're not even tired.|sd
B|Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh.|qy
A|And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.|sd
B|Oh, it does?|bh
A|It sure does.|na
B|That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.|sv
A|I, they kept telling me that,|sd
A|and I thought they're crazy,|sd
A|so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and it did it.|sd
B|Wow.|ba
B|That's great.|ba
A|But it's, uh,|%
B|That's great.|ba
B|That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,|sd
A|and then we hope for it,|sd
A|and it never happens|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but it really, it does get good gas mileage.|sd
B|Well, that's excellent.|ba
A|Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs?|qy
B|Is it a very reliable kind of car?|qy
A|I haven't had anything,|sd
A|I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,|sd
A|and it cost me the twenty-five dollars.|sd
A|The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it,|sd
A|we couldn't get the light,|sd
A|they have all these lights in the car|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and we couldn't get the light to turn off.|sd
B|Um.|b
A|And we kept trying, you know,|sd
A|and we went out to dinner with some friends,|sd
A|and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know|sd
B|Oh dear.|ba
B|Oh dear|ba
A|and we couldn't get it to turn off,|sd
A|and the next day my husband goes out there|sd
A|and he tries to get it off,|sd
A|we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we turned everything we could,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and he took it in,|sd
A|and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.|sd
A|He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,|sd
A|and I can't get the light off,|^q
A|it's broken.|^q
B|Yes.|b
A|So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,|sd
A|and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,|sd
A|and they showed us where the switch was.|sd
B|They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh.|bf
A|They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.|aa
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|oh, so they probably went through the,|qy^d
A|But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one.|sd
B|I see|b
A|And it's right on the arm rest in the back|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we didn't know it was there.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car|sd
B|And found it right away.|qy^d
A|and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But we've had just, uh,|%
A|I guess it's been in two times.|sd
A|I've had it three years now.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times.|sd
A|But it's just been real minor things.|sd
B|Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,|sv
B|and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,|sv
B|so.|%
A|That's right.|aa
A|But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car.|sd
A|Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know|sd
B|Yes|b
A|and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.|sv
B|No,|aa
B|not at all.|aa
A|And they keep going up,|sv
A|so I'll have to enjoy it,|sd
A|Okay Brian.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Hi,|fp
B|how you doing Kevin?|fp
A|Fine, thanks|fp
B|Good,|ba
B|good,|ba
B|glad to hear that.|sd
B|I understand,|%
A|Are you a total banner?|qy
B|Total banner?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
B|No,|nn
B|I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids|sv
B|and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.|sv
B|I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.|sv
B|Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns|sv
B|and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,|sv
B|so on a scale of one to ten, I, I think I would rate myself as a, in the six or seven or eight.|sd
A|Okay.|bk
B|But, I think that there ought to be some control,|sv
B|but I still think that, uh, individuals have a right.|sv
B|How do you feel about it?|qo
A|Well, so, let me make sure,|^h
A|so you think that, uh, maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate?|qy
B|Well, I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate.|no
B|Uh, that, uh, that might cool down some tempers.|sv
B|I think a, a one day would be sufficient.|sv
B|The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows|sv
B|and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun, if that five day waiting period were in effect, you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show.|sv
A|Uh, you just, you would be able to buy it,|ar
A|but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose, huh.|sv
B|Well, I don't think you can mail thing, guns through the mail.|ar
B|I don't know.|h
A|Oh.|b
A|Okay.|b
B|I think that's a, against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated|sd
A|Oh, yeah?|bh
B|So, how do you feel about guns?|qo
A|Let's see,|^h
A|I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns|sv
A|and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|whether, you know,|%
B|Well, do you think that there will continue to always be crazies?|qy
A|Sure.|na
B|Then, uh, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns?|qo
A|Well, we have some laws on the books that, uh, don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns, if I understand correctly.|sd
A|And, uh, I would agree,|sd
A|a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,|sv
A|but uh, I think banning semiautomatic twenty-two rifles is a, a bit on the extreme side.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.|sv
B|Okay.|bk
B|Do you, uh, do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a, an automatic handgun?|qy
A|The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.|sv
A|or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,|sv
A|but, uh,|%
B|Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,|sv
B|but, the public, I don't know.|sv
A|I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Not a automatic, semiautomatic.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|not an Uzi|sv
A|No,|aa
A|no.|aa
A|Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|You saw Indiana Jones,|qy^d
A|the guy came after him with that big knife.|sd
B|Yes.|ny
A|And just, he took care of it,|sd
A|just one shot.|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|that's true,|aa
B|and he, uh, saved himself in the, in the, in the process also.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|So how is work going?|qw
B|Very fine,|sd
B|very,|%
A|They don't let you take guns to work, do they?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|they, That's, uh, that's prohibited where we work.|sd
B|Although down here in Texas, uh you do have a right to, to wear and carry arms with you at all times.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's still that's still, you can still do that down here.|sd
A|Can they be, Is it concealed,|qy
A|or does it have to,|%
B|Oh, you can't,|ng
B|no,|nn
B|it should not be concealed.|sd
A|Has to be on the hip?|qy
B|It has to be on the hip|na
B|Has to be in sight so that, uh, you know, that you're not, uh, a menace or a problem to individuals.|sd
A|Can a|%
B|How about where you live there in Utah?|qo
A|Okay, Howard,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what do you think of our space budget|qo
A|and should we go ahead and, and keep exploring,|qy
A|or should we call a halt to it,|qrr
A|is it doing any good?|qy
B|I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.|sv
B|Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.|sv
B|However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.|sv
B|So I think it's been a good investment.|sv
B|Uh, somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed  program.|sd
A|Oh, really.|b
A|Oh, yes.|b
A|Wish our post office could do that|sd
B|I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.|sd
A|That's right.|aa
A|I wish they'd just deliver stuff.|sd
B|I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,|sv
B|I think maybe  we can  pick up and go on now.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I, I don't know.|h
B|I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.|sv
A|I agree.|aa
B|The space  station's where we should go  at this  point.|sv
A|I agree.|aa
A|Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor|sv
A|and, you know, you know, and I'm in favor of, you know, getting closer to seeing certain things,|sd
A|but I'd like to see them also go, you know, go back up there, see, you know, what they can do. See about setting a space station up.|sd
A|I'm all in favor of the space program,|sd
A|and I don't think we should stop,|sv
A|and I don't think we should cut the money.|sv
B|Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?|qo
A|Uh.|^h
B|You talking about, uh, uh, a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|I would like, I'd like to see that.|sd
A|I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.|sd
A|But who knows.|h
A|And I would like to see them do something like that.|sd
B|Well,|%
A|I,  I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things|sv
A|and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.|sv
B|Well, I think about half the nations now are, are military related, are they not?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|yes.|ny
B|And, uh, It seems like it's that high a percentage.|sv
A|I believe they are.|sd
A|You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our experiments and all the, you know, our actual exploring of space and, and all that,|ad
A|and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.|sv
B|Well, it can't afford to|sv
A|Huh-uh, you know.|aa
A|Have you gone out to, uh, Fort Worth to see the space, Soviet space exhibit?|qy
B|No,|nn

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|We need  to go.|sd
A|We went, uh,|sd
A|we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,|sd

A|I mean, it's really neat how they, they have done it.|sd
A|They have done a beautiful job.|sd
B|Have they?|bh
A|And they have a, uh, scaled down model showing how they, you know, fuel it, or, you know, how they, uh, oh, the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they, uh,|sd
A|all the things that are against the actual space mission, uh, space ship, you know, how they fall away from it,|sd
A|and the loading of it|sd
B|Oh, yes.|b
A|and then it's actually, you know,|sd
A|the smoke comes out like it's taking off.|sd
A|It is really interesting.|sd
B|Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.|sv
A|You really do.|aa
A|It's, it's well worth the time and effort.|sd
A|We went, uh, early on Sunday.|sd
A|We got out there about, uh, ten, ten thirty,|sd

B|Um, I think both of my kids are too old for that|sd

B|Did you,|%
A|they really did like it.|sd
B|It's very impressive, I'm sure.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|it is,|sd
A|and I felt the, uh, six year old would, you know, that he'd be kind of bored,|sd
A|but he wasn't.|sd
A|Even the three year old enjoyed it|sd
A|because they had one, had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon, and showed it moving around and stuff.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So it was really neat.|sd
B|Well, see, that's something else.|ba
B|The Russians have had space stations, manned space stations for years now.|sd
B|You know, they had the  Merv|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Well, in going through it, I got the impression that actually they were farther ahead,|sd

B|All right.|b
A|Do you exercise, uh, during the day time or go to a gym or anything?|qy
B|Oh.|b
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I, I used to go to a gym, um, last summer,|sd
B|but then I started school again,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, I, I do enjoy, um, going to a gym and working out,|sd
B|or just like, I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up,|sd
B|and I ride a exercise bike a lot.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's really weird,|sv
A|because I'll get down on the floor,|sd
A|and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki,|sd
A|I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises, now.|sd
A|And she can be upstairs in the bedroom,|sd
A|and I don't know.|h
A|She knows what I'm talking about.|sd
A|You know, pretty soon, here she comes.|sd
A|So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, I had a problem with my back,|sd
A|so, when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
A|So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then, then my back gives me a problem again.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So I try to do it every night,|sd
A|and uh.|%
B|Oh, that's  good.|ba
A|Yeah,|aa
A|it seems like it's, you know,|%
A|I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it you know,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so you know it's got to be good for you.|sv
B|Right|b
A|But, um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So, I was kind of thinking about joining it,|sd
A|but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it does really make you feel good,|sv
A|and I like to bicycle, too.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b

B|Yeah,|aa
B|it does.|aa

B|And, um, we go on a, like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|So I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, you know, can be in shape .|sd

A|otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, huh?|qy

A|well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know,|sd
A|and, um.|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.|qy
B|Oh, yeah,|ny
B|that's what I like to do.|sd
A|You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape,|sd
A|and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape  you know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
A|So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night you know,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Wow|ba
A|So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|that is neat|ba
A|You know, so. Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising.|sd
A|I wish I knew how to swim,|sd
A|but I don't,|sd
A|so I don't go swimming.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|um, I don't swim much, neither.|sd

B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that.|sd
A|If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there,|sd
A|but they don't have a pool in this small city, either.|sd
B|Oh.  Um.|b
A|So.  Well, listen then,|fc
A|it's been nice talking to you.|fc

A|for a hobby or for,|qy
B|Uh-huh,|ny
B|I do it for a hobby|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I have my own equipment,|sd
B|and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, uh, in the process of getting a router|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out.|sd
B|What kind of things do you like to do with wood?|qo
A|Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out.|arp_nd
A|My husband cuts them out|arp_nd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw is, is a lot slower|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then, uh, he's got a router,|sd
A|but now he wants a plunge router.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Yeah.|b
A|But anyhow, he cuts them out,|sd
A|and then I, I took a tole painting class to learn how to paint them right,  you know.|sd
B|Oh.|bk
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and and see if we can sell some of them.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|But, uh, I really like it so far.|sd
B|Oh, that is fun.|ba
A|And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|so I took a pattern off of that,|sd
A|and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then you, you make the dress for it,|sd
A|and you drill holes around the top of the head|sd
A|and you, you stick in uh, like rope and tie ribbons around it.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|the twine.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|those are  so cute.|sv
A|It looked really  cute, you know.|sd

B|Oh, that is, that sounds really fun.|ba
B|well, they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I just got back from that today,|sd
B|so if you could get your projects into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You could make a lot of money from those.|sv
A|What do you do?|qo
A|I wonder how you,|qw^d
A|you just, they buy them from you,|qy^d
A|or you just given them to them on consignment or something?|qrr
B|Uh, apparently,|na
B|like that boutique, um, they take, oh what was it, twenty percent of the sell price.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You would put your sell price|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|uh, and then they would take twenty percent off of that at the counter.|sd
A|Um, I see.|bk

A|I will go out and get it myself.|sd
A|And I will never, I never buy anything from a telephone, salesperson.|sd

A|So, I really feel that it is a real invasion, they're invading my time and my space by, you know, interfering in whatever I'm doing|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I,|%
A|it really bothers me.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't, you know, ignore it, uh, quite as easily.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And I, I try to be polite,|sd
A|but at the same point,|sd
B|That doesn't always work.|^2
A|Well, I just say thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested,|sd
A|and then I hang up before they can say anything.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yes,|ny
A|and it works very well|sv
B|Oh|b
A|Because you don't hear, you know how,|sd
A|they can say anything they want|sd
A|it's just,|%
A|but I just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of, my thing on invasion of privacy.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, um, I have, uh, I sort of have a sort like|sd
A|you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists.|sd
A|I wish that there were a way that you could, um, get your you know, submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things, from a|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|well, how do you get your name off the junk mailing list?|qw
A|Uh, you, you, you, you do that by, uh, um,|sd
A|the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send,|sd
A|it's for every company,|sd
A|I mean you can't do it for any|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, but you can then send it|sd
A|and they can|sd
A|they tell,|%
A|that company is not allowed to sent it, you any junk mail.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can,|sd
B|Oh, I didn't even know that.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to, not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies.|sd
B|Oh, wow.|ba
A|And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and you could say that, uh, have your your number put in a registry.|sd
A|And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and could not, should, and is not allowed under penalty of, you know, being reported or something to call you.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that would be one way of doing it.|sd
B|I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy,|sd
B|but one of my pet peeves, you came up with the telephone is, when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I can't stand that.|sd
B|I think that is so stupid, you know,|sd
B|because,|%
A|Oh, I'm guilty of that sometimes|sd
A|because I've called and there really wasn't any significant message|sd
A|and I, and I wasn't going to be available to be called back.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it was sort of like, oh, the hell,|sd
A|I'm not going to spend the time giving, leaving a message,|sd
A|and, uh, I'll call later, if I'm available.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|The other thing that, um, that there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when you, you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, legally now they're not allowed,|sd
A|they're|%
A|you do not have to give a telephone number.|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Yes.|ny
A|And I don't really like announcing in public|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|you know, when you're sitting there,|sd
A|my telephone and I don't like the way telephone numbers can be used.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number,|sd
A|but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number.|sd
A|And, uh, we were able, we weren't actually able to trace it, but we were able to, to discard the charges.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um, but it was,|sd
B|I don't like how they|sd
B|the,|%
B|I, I realize that this is your identification|sd
B|but I worked with someone that got hold of his, charge cards, and his social security number.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|same with my husband.|sd
A|It was the charge card and social security number.|sd
B|And, you know, I don't, I don't like, I don't ever get anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out.|sd
A|Well, you should never give the social security number.|sd
A|Uh, if sometimes, if you charge,|sd
A|sometimes I charge theater tickets over the phone.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, you know, because they pick them up at the box office we'll call.|sd
A|But, um, that's the only thing I would ever have ever used it for the phone|sd
A|and that was because I initiated it.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|Uh, and occasionally I do order things from catalogs over the phone.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But again it's, I initiate it not the company.|sd
A|The other thing is though you do not have to,|sd
A|if you're buying something in a store and they and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number, you do not have to give it.|sd
A|That is one, that's a law that went into effect, I don't know a year or two ago.|sd
B|Oh, I never even knew that.|sd
A|And, uh, you can just say I'm sorry that uh, I'm not required to give that by law|sd
A|and then they won't,|%
A|a lot of stores will still ask.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, the credit card company, you know, accepts the charges.|sd
A|I mean|%
A|a|%
A|the credit cards company's responsibility.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, is there any, like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy?|qy

A|Um, well, this would, this is limited to the privacy issue, the invasion of privacy.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk

A|they said, well, aren't you planning to have children.|sd
A|Well, I mean, that's none of their business.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And but of course, now by law they can't ask that.|sd

A|I sometimes feel you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit.|sv

B|Because I know,|%
A|You know, for example airline pilots.|sd

B|That's another story.|sd
A|Okay|bk
B|And, uh, and, uh, I do the edging and stuff like that,|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Well, that's nice|ba
A|I wish I could say that.|sd

A|but it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working to, you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds. Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and, because, like, we have a dog and, and, you know, he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|That's true.|ba
A|But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.|sd

A|I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that, sort of thing|sd
B|I don't|sd
A|No?|bh
B|No,|nn
B|he does that.|sd

A|that's all it gets.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Huh, okay,|b
B|we don't have that many bushes to put them on.|sd
B|Uh, our, our yard is very, uh, narrow|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

B|but we have a nice tree in the front|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, wow.|ba
B|and, uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.|sd
A|Oh, no.|ba
B|You know, every time you do that, it, uh, kind of kills the tree for a while.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And we started mowing our own lawn|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because they were doing that.|sd
B|And so, anyways I have a nice full tree now|sd
B|and, and we put , we fill it with lights and that kind of thing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Um. But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to do it?|%

A|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|it's like seventy a month.|sd
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|and I don't like,|sd

A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh,|%
A|Well, do, do they do other things for you all?|qy

B|and the sprinkler system that,|sd
B|that|%
B|our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does|sd
B|and, uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b

A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|%
B|So,|%
A|But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?|qy
B|Well, it, it, it went up what we pay.|na

B|They,|%
B|only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.|na
A|Oh, okay.|bk

A|So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?|qy
B|Right,|na
B|uh-huh,|ny
B|yeah,|ny
B|so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.|sd
A|I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.|sd
B|I know.|ba
A|And put new ones out front.|sd
A|But that was a lot of work.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Took me a long time.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's what we did when we first moved in, too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Just rearranged some things|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|and then, then we put in a sprinkler system,|sd
A|and, We won't go through that again,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|I will pay someone to do it|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Oh, it took so long.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Because my husband was, you know, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know,|sd
A|there is a machine that will do it.|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.|sd
A|And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.|sv
B|Oh.|b
B|That's true,|aa
B|so gosh,|ba
B|you did it manually.|bf
A|By hand.|sd
B|Oh.|b
B|Oh, gosh.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|but it works great now that we've got it.|sd
B|I bet.|ba
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's nice.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's a good investment there.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,|sd
A|you know, you have to keep the, the area moist around the house or it makes it worse,|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|so, we had an incentive there to do that.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?|qy
B|Oh, this is kind of tough.|^h
B|I don't too often watch, you know, shows that are on, on a regular bases.|ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I don't have a lot of time|sd
B|and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth.|sd
B|I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.|sv
A|No.|b
B|But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES, every week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, ugh,|%
B|it's kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.|sd
B|Uh, like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch, uh, KNOTS LANDING|sd
A|Oh, you will?|bh
B|Yeah,|ny
B|just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type of thing,|sd
A|Relax.|bf
B|but, uh. How about you?|qo
A|Well, I watch, um,|sd
A|I like news programs, like you mentioned,|sd
A|and sometimes I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't get that so I don't have, that choice.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I like that.|sd
A|I, I watch that a couple of times a week, um,|sd
A|it comes on like at nine o'clock, at night|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch regularly.|sd
A|I, I have seen that, um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on, Monday nights before|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and it's kind of cute,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, but I don't,|%
B|But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh, fellow.|sd
A|Oh, but,|b
B|I mean he's playing a military part.|sd
B|He's the husband of, the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|I know who you're talking about.|sd
A|I haven't, I have seen it, I think, maybe once.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you know, it it was on one time when I saw it|sd
B|and, you know, it, it's pretty cute.|sv
A|I like that|sd
A|Well, I, um, I,|%
A|we really don't watch too many programs regularly.|sd
A|My children like some of the morning children's shows, when they're home.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|They, um,|%
A|I just have one son who's in kindergarten|sd
A|so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's called.|sd
A|It's just like a SESAME STREET, show,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but and they watch a couple of shows like that,|sd
A|but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|no|aa
B|I don't,|%
A|And, uh,|%
B|I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh,|sd
B|and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time.|sd
B|But, uh, they have programs on, uh, house repairs and, how to build things|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Um.|%
B|and, um, they have a calligraphy show,|sd
B|and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that.|sd
A|Oh, that's nice.|ba
B|And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.|sd
B|I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something,|sd
B|and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.|sd
A|That sounds like a good idea.|ba
A|I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V,|sd
A|and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I record some.|sd
A|And then, uh, we have just totally cut down,|sd
A|and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then, and watch and then record over it, something else.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|we do some of that,|sd
B|In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V, than, you know, other kinds of things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies|sd
A|and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies, that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|those are pretty good|sv
B|I, I like those old ones, much better than some of the new stuff.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|And so we, we have really enjoyed that|sd
A|and it's really nice not to be running out.|sd
A|Some of the video rentals can be expensive|sd
A|and,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|And, boy,|^2
B|the movie can be unbelievable.|^2
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|right.|b
A|Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.|sd
A|So we,|%
A|I have,|%
A|and it's so convenient at home|sd
A|and you can do it anytime you take the notion.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so, I have really enjoyed that|sd
A|but, but there are,|%
A|I do have friends that watch programs|sd
A|like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.|sd
A|They have some programs that they won't miss.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I'm not that hung up to most things.|sd
B|I mean if I miss something big deal|sd
A|Yes.|b
A|Well, and things are repeated, so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's true.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.|sd
A|Pretty funny.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, T V is something that we try to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it, like you say.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|We do too.|sd
B|Too many other things to do and too much going on.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your, spare time.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Right.|aa
B|I agree.|aa
A|So it's a little bit, something that we try doing|sd
A|and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational|sd
A|but still you want them to go out and do other things.|sd
A|Even if they're, good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Anyway. Well,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Okay.|b
B|Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?|qy

B|or a person personally.|sv

A|it's really sad.|sv

A|I don't know,|sd

A|Do you think most states have that|qy
A|or?|%
B|Yes,|ny
B|I think most states do have capital punishment.|sd
B|Yes.|ny
B|But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.|sv
A|That still does it,|bf
A|that's right.|ba
B|Yes,|aa
B|they're only,|%
B|I was reading something about it the other day,|sd
B|I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|A lot of them had to have elected not to do so.|sv
B|Now I don't know, what they do in place of it.|sd
B|You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something,|sv
B|I I don't know how they handle it|sd
B|I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.|sd
A|Have that.|bf
A|Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean,|sv
A|there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.|sv
B|Oh, yes.|b
B|Yes,|aa
B|a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, it seems like a of people live there,|sv
A|and then through appeals.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|Because I know they do frequently,|sv
A|I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yes.|b
A|If it finally gets to that point.|sd
B|Right,|b
B|the first appeal is automatic,|sv
B|so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.|sv

A|So is it, uh,|%
A|are we doing lethal injection now?|qy

A|Uh-huh,|b
A|which seems so awful.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|it certainly does.|sd

B|I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes.|sd
B|I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.|sd
A|Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime|qy

B|No,|nn

B|we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.|sv
B|This may seem to be the best way out.|sv
B|I don't know.|h
A|Yes.|b
B|Easiest way out maybe.|bf
B|No,|nn
B|I don't think it's a monetary thing.|sv
A|Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area|sd
A|It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it|sv
B|Yes,|b

A|But I, you know,|%
A|we have been really fortunate|sd
A|our family, hasn't had any crime.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Yes,|b
B|so have we been very, very fortunate.|sd
A|And, so we don't,|%
A|it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.|sv
B|That's right.|ba
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|And how they would expect, how they would hope,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.|sv
B|Absolutely.|b
A|And you wonder why they can't just stop it.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's right.|ba
A|So, maybe you would,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.|sd
B|So would I,|aa
B|I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance,|sd
B|I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.|sd
A|No,|aa
A|I know when, um,|%
A|we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|just like constantly, it seemed like,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but fortunately I had small children|sd
A|and I didn't have to go.|sd
B|Right.|b
A|And it's not that,|sv
A|I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it's just that, I didn't,|sd
A|I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.|sd
B|Sure,|aa
B|it's, it's a big responsibility,|sv
B|it really is.|sv
A|And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|So would I.|sd
A|That would be really awful.|ba
B|Yes.|aa
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult|sd
A|but, uh.|%
B|It is, it's a tough subject,|sv
B|it really is.|sv
A|I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.|sv
B|Right.|b

B|Bye-bye.|fc
A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|wow, I don't know what that was.|sd
B|What was that?|qw
A|I don't know|sd
B|And, uh, to, uh, the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, yes.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh, we have not camped in any of those places,|sd
A|in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,|sd
A|but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, uh, Daingerfield|sd
A|and in Texas that is where we camp basically. Uh,|sd
B|What are they like?|qo
A|They are very nice.|sd
A|Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.|sd
A|It has a nice little lake|sd
A|and it has some really wonderful, uh, sights that are in the wooded areas.|sd
A|Uh, the facilities are quite nice|sd
A|and our children liked, liked it quite well.|sd
A|and you know they,|%
A|we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.|sd
A|And, uh, it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, now Daingerfield is,|%
A|let's see,|^h
A|I think that's a little bit more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.|sv
A|No,|ar
A|I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.|sv
A|At any rate it was, it was very nice as well.|sd
A|But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, uh, had done a lot of camping in Michigan,|sd
A|I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially,|sd
A|and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,|sd
A|so, uh, my parents were real avid campers|sd
A|and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.|sd
A|So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Do you have a large tent|qy
A|or,|%
B|Yeah,|ny
B|it was a nine by twelve.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And how many does it sleep, uh, comfortably?|qw
B|Well, there, well supposedly,|sv
B|they always say it sleeps more than it does.|sv
A|Right|b
B|But they,|%
B|it would have slept three adults anyway.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, uh, we invested in some stacking, uh, cots, you know, that were like bunk, bunk beds,|sd
A|but they were cots, fold up cots.|sd
A|That really gave us a lot more space, um, floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around|sd
A|and,|%
B|Right.|b
A|uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day|sd
A|so that was real nice.|sd
A|But, uh, we, uh,|%
A|like, my in-laws also had a camper, or, uh, a pop up tent, you know, one of those trailer tops|sd
A|and those are really nice too.|sd
A|A little more, uh, luxurious, so to speak, but not much|sd
B|do they have a kitchen in them?|qy
A|Yes,|ny
A|uh-huh.|ny
A|It's really nice,|sd
A|in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, uh, and the whole business.|sd
A|It was quite nice in that respect.|sd
A|Uh, and everything was very convenient|sd
A|and you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,|sd
B|Trunk  of your car all time, right.|^2
A|and that was nice.|sd
A|So, uh, do you have plans for, for any other camping trips in the near future?|qy
B|Uh, maybe, uh, maybe back to Caddo, or, Uh, Purdis Creek.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,|sd
B|it's a new park.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And there is, uh, not really camping,|sd
B|but, uh,|%
B|what is it called, Cedar Hill.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Lake Joe Pool.|sd
A|Oh, yes.|b
B|And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.|sd
A|Yes,|aa
A|yes,|aa
A|I have been in that area.|sd
A|That is a really pretty state park.|sv
A|Uh, just,|%
A|we did not camp there,|sd
A|but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area|sd
A|and it's real lovely.|sv
A|It's close to the lake and close to,|sd
A|I think it's close to the dam up there|sd
A|so it's, it's really quite pretty.|sv
A|Uh, are you, um,|qy
A|let's see what was,|^h
A|I was going to ask you something else.|^h
A|Oh, do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?|qy
B|Oh, from those three,|^h
B|just, just, uh, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best.|na
A|Yeah,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?|qy
B|Yeah,|ny
B|that's right.|sd
A|I, I would,|%
A|I have never been there|sd
A|and I would love to see what it looks like|sd
B|It's not, it's not very deep.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they did build a dam on it,|sd
B|but it was there before they built the dam.|sd
B|It has been there for a hundred years.|sd
A|Oh, I see.|b
B|Apparently, an earth quake caused it.|sv
A|How interesting.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|I guess I never heard the history of that.|sd
A|Huh, well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go.|sd
A|We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.|sd
A|Um, our children are both grown|sd
A|and, and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.|sd
A|And so, uh, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see what it looks like.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's really nice.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And I, I don't know,|h
B|probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere  in Texas.|sv

B|Um, she's like a little shadow, you know, kind of, follows me around all the time,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.|sd
B|She doesn't hear very well|sd

B|she doesn't see very well|sd
B|but she's,|%
A|Well, that's to be expected at, their age.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|at this age, I guess so.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, she's been a good dog to have,|sd
B|and I don't know,|sd
B|once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not|sd
A|Well, everybody always says no more|sv
B|Yeah,|b

B|I agree,|aa
B|yes.|aa
B|Um, did you get yours as a pet for your|qy
B|do you have children?|qy
A|Uh, yeah,|ny
A|we, have five.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before|qy^d
B|or,|%
A|Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.|sd
A|She was fifteen when she died.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that, somebody,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|people drop things like that off, up there,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."|sd
A|I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Go get her.|^q
A|So that's how we got her, quite by accident.|sd
B|Isn't that,|b
B|Yes.|b
B|So that often happens that way.|sv
B|Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.|sd
B|We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went, then we went out then, and found one,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|she was in the litter,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.|sd
B|I mean, they were all over the place,|sd
B|and she was real docile and, came over and just kind of sat next to us,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and I thought, that's the dog for me|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|She picked us|^q
B|Yeah,|b
B|so she,|%
B|and it,|%
B|what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been,|sd
B|let's see,|^h
B|she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, um, she just loved this little dog, to pieces|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.|sd
B|I think, she was always a little bit leery of her.|sv
A|Oh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,|sd
B|but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.|sd
A|Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
B|So you just never know how that works out|sv
A|No.|aa
A|But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
A|they want to and tell them anything they want to|sv
A|and, nobody is going to, you know, reprimand them or, know their secrets|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|That's right.|ba
A|or|%
B|That,|%
B|yes,|b
B|they're very, unjudgmental|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yes|b
B|Oh, dear|ba
A|And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.|sv
B|Yes,|b
B|I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|and how,|%
A|Our one, our one nursing home in has one.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Permanent|sd
B|Is that right?|qy
A|He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is or somebody takes care of him.|na
B|Isn't that amazing?|bh
A|But he goes out people,|sv
A|and real nice dog, uh,|sv
A|and, uh,|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yes.|b
B|It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis|sd
B|and, um, there were several dogs on the campus|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and, the,|%
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,|sd
B|but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.|sd
B|And, um, I'm sure someone, you know, fed them.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|They were healthy, looking dogs.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, um, our guide that day said that the , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus. Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard|sd
A|Is that right?|bh
A|Yeah|b
A|because most campuses don't allow pets, you know,|sv
B|I know.|b
A|they just do not allow them.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|I know.|sv
A|That's, that's kind of great.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|it really was.|sv
B|It was just a nice touch,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and it kind of made it seem more homey too|sv
A|Yes,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But, um,|%
B|I thought that was most unique.|sv
B|And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying, about the dog having sort of free run of the, the nursing home.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, um, but, uh, I,|%
B|this is the only pet we've had you know,|sd
A|Um.|%
B|in all our years of marriage, um,|sd
B|and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs|sd
B|but they were always hunting dogs,|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|they were always kind of,|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|we've ruined them|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|right.|b
B|That's what he said.|sd
A|They say ruined them|sv
B|Yes.|b
B|So having a pet was a little bit different for him.|sd
A|Well, we've had a lot of different pets.|sd
A|We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we also raised them for food, at one time.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|Oh, yes.|b
A|And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet. For more years than I want to think about|sd
B|Oh, my golly.|ba
A|She was in the house|sd
B|Oh, gosh.|ba
B|Isn't that interesting?|bh
B|I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.|sd
A|Well, don't ever get one for a pet.|ad
B|Oh.|b
A|They're okay,|sd
A|but like she, uh,|%
A|they don't ever learn their name.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|you had to go chase her down.|sd
B|I'll be darned.|ba
B|How interesting.|ba
A|And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.|sd
A|But,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.|sd
A|They,|%
A|before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, they're not|sd
A|I mean, they use the litter box.|sd
A|That's about it .|sd
B|Isn't that interesting?|bh
B|That's, that's really something.|ba
B|Um, how long did you have that?|qw
A|Oh, my, how, how long?|bf
A|Probably seven or eight years.|sd
B|Goodness sake.|ba
A|And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"|sd
A|so, we moved her to the basement,|sd
A|and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, built her a pen outside|sd
B|Oh, my gosh.|ba
B|Isn't that funny?|bh
A|And I thought, I put up with that all those years|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|and this is what it took finally|bf
A|And, we've had, we've had cats, stay in the house. Different times.|sd
B|That is,|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
A|Uh, one of them ran off.|sd
A|She ran off once,|sd
A|or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,|sd
A|and the second time he never came back.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|he kind of moved into a woods down there.|sd
B|I'll be.|ba
A|And he got huge down there.|sd
B|My goodness.|ba
A|He really grew|sd
A|but he, he never came back.|sd
B|That's That's interesting.|ba
B|I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.|sv
A|Well, he wasn't a whole lot.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He was in the house most the time,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, uh, he did go out sometimes|sd
A|and, uh, they|%
A|it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.|sd
B|Is that right?|qy
A|Yeah.|ny
A|The, the cats,|%
A|my son has a cat,|sd
A|and the vet had told us they get strange, if they're kept in the house all the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And their cat was not a friendly cat,|sd
A|it was, it was not a good,|sd
B|Well.|%
A|I don't know,|sd
A|it got,|%
A|it was just, did get strange|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so that that was right.|sv
A|And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And it has improved the personality.|sd
A|What do you do there in Lubbock as far as, uh, recycling is concerned?|qw
B|Well, you know they actually started|sd
B|and I assumed it was T I wide, uh,|sv
B|they, they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|uh, I've you know|%
B|either computer paper or different types of paper.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose,|sd
B|but I, I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in|sv
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|what would be more efficient about it.|qw
B|Uh.|%
A|what,|%
B|Well, the way they have, you know, they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module, or down the hall|sd
B|or  a lot of people aren't going to get up, walk out of their offices and go there.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You know, where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.|sd
B|That's just what we called them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they were recycled cardboard.|sd
B|They were eight and a half by eleven|sd
B|and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there|sd
B|and when it filled up you called, you know facilities whoever to come pick it up|sd
B|and they brought you another box.|sd
B|So not only is it, you know,|sd
B|I think more people would take advantage of it and use it, uh,|sv
B|I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to, to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing.|sv
A|Oh.|b
A|I see.|b
B|So,|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I, I, I, uh, was going to say cause I know I have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it you know|sd
B|Right.|b
A|and, uh,  if  if I have a, if I, I printed up something that I don't need it, just chunk it in the, in the paper.|sd
B|If.|%
B|Right,|b
B|but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together|sd
A|That's true.|ba
B|and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full, you close the box, it's already bundled, it's already done for you.|sd
A|Certainly  that's a good idea.|ba
B|So you're  saving a lot of time and effort.|sv
B|I just need to put it on paper and I guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, what else do they do in the Dallas area?|qo
A|Well, uh, as far as T I is concerned, I'm not sure.|sd
A|Uh, and I have heard, you know, uh, in residential situations.|sd
A|I live in a dorm|sd
A|and I have heard in residential situations, uh, like in Plano uh, that they are doing, uh, stuff like having recycle picked up where, uh, the city, uh, I guess the sanitation department, uh, as part of their responsibility picks up, uh, the recycled items as well, you know, the plastics and the paper uh, and aluminum|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|%
A|and, uh, the only responsibility of the, of the, patron is to separate them|sd
A|and then the, the,|%
A|uh, I guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them|sv
A|and it doesn't cost the patron anything.|sd
A|Doesn't really cost the, uh, department.|sd
B|Anything extra.|^2
A|Right.|aa
A|They don't pay, they don't pay for the recycled items.|sd
B|That sounds good.|ba
B|There's,|%
B|I, I've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where, you know, from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other|sd
B|or the, the even, uh,|%
B|there are areas that can recycle the, the tin cans, like your you know, vegetable things come in|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, so I, I've not done that,|sd
B|but that's kind of what I want to set up so. Because we do go through aluminum cans, you know.|sd
B|That's probably the one we use most.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but,|%
A|Well, what kind of services do you have there in Lubbock as far as,|qw
A|I, I lived in Abilene for a, uh,|sd
A|I went to school there at Abilene Christian|sd
A|and I,|%
A|it was so hard to, uh,|sd
A|you know if you  you wanted to recycle you newspapers it was impossible.|sv
B|Find a place.|^2
B|Well, uh, uh they, they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers, aluminum cans, those are the two major items.|sd
B|You know, we can take oil, like car oil, recycled oil to,|sd
B|they have, uh, uh, dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town.|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles things like that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, but, I, I don't know.|h
B|I know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So,|%
A|Well, that's good.|sv
B|I do that|sd
B|I think people are becoming more aware. You know of, of the waste|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and you know I, I like to see, you know,|%
B|you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.|sv
B|You know, maybe it's making an impact|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Do you tend to buy more recycled items that, if something, uh, the pack says recycled and something else doesn't?|qy
A|Do,|%
A|would you tend to chose the one that does|qy
A|or,|%
B|I'm not as good about searching something out like that|ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but if I am there and the choice is there I would probably take the recycled product.|sd
A|Um.|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.|sv
A|Sure,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|So, uh, you know, they are getting away from the styrofoam,|sd
A|Well a lot of women are as knowledge about football as I am.|sv
A|Can I guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the Steelers.|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|uh-huh.|ny
A|Well, I can understand that.|sd
A|I, you know, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.|sd
B|Do you?|qy
A|They've had  some great games in the past.|na
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|I, I always enjoy watching the the, Dallas and Pittsburgh together. You know.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|me too.|aa
A|It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.|sv
A|He lives in the Dallas area now, as a matter of fact.|sd
B|Does he really?|qy
A|Well, actually, it's probably closer to Fort Worth,|sd
A|but it's, it's in the same area.|sd
A|He bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often.|sd
A|As a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.|sd
B|Oh,|ba
B|I wonder if he'd ever do that.|qy^d
A|I don't know,|no
A|he'd be good at it.|sv
A|He's such a motivator, he,  primarily,  you know, with the quarterbacks.|sv
B|Yes.|aa
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That  would be his specialty.|sv
A|I wished, I wished they could work something,|sv
A|I really like him.|sd
A|I really do.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well what about the Houston Oilers.|qo
B|Do you like them?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl.|sd
A|That would be really great.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|That may not ever happen,|sv
A|I don't know.|h
A|Uh, Houston  has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years|sv
A|and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|And Warren Moon,  is, is  proving himself quite well right now.|sv
A|That's right.|ba
A|He certainly is,|aa
A|he's very good.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He's very good.|sv
B|He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are.|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,|sv
A|but he's no longer with the team.|sd
A|So, you're right,|sv
A|there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year.|qo
A|You have any idea.|qy
B|I don't know,|no
B|I hope they, they do better.|sv
B|They, they|%
B|during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,   that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Oh, yeah,|b
A|that was just such super team.|sv
B|Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Well that's a tough,|ba
A|it would be tough to do,|sv
A|it really would.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|four in a row.|sd
A|Four in a row.|sd
A|I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.|sd
B|Oh, I don't know.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Shooting  for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.|sd
A|That's right|ba
A|And,|%
B|But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,|sd
B|so.|%
A|That's right.|ba
B|I think Mike Webster was left|sv
B|but then he, he just left.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|He may have been the last of the old guard,|sv
A|I don't know.|h
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think he is,|sv
B|I think he was.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|they had such a super team.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I didn't.|sd
A|I see.|bk
B|Huh-uh.|b
A|There's quite a bit of activity now,|sv
A|of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.|sv
A|They picked up,  you  know, quite a few of the,|sd
B|Uh.|%
A|of course you never know.|sv
A|The guys they pick, you know, may never play a game.|sv
A|You never know,|sv
A|it's, it's a gamble,|sv
A|it really is.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know,|sd
B|Well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?|qw
A|Ever been?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born|sd
A|his name was Sam Huff.|sd
A|He used to play for the New York Giants.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,  as  far as, you know, dedication.|sd
B|Really.|b
A|He just went all out every single play.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,|sv
A|there's been so many.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
A|But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.|sd
B|Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,|sv
B|well, I, I come from a large family|sd
B|and, there's quite a few boys|sd
B|so that's kind of how I got in with the football.|sd
B|Either watch that or watch nothing.|sd
A|That's right.|b
B|And, um, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I  thought he was kind of cocky or something.|sd
A|He is,|sv
A|he is,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|of course a quarterback has a big ego.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|They really they have to have,|sv
A|they can't survive.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you.|sd
B|Yeah|b
B|him and Franco Harris,|sd
B|I really didn't care for the either two of them.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
B|I mean  they were good,|sv
B|but, I, you know, you couldn't deny that.|sv
A|Oh yeah.|b
B|But I  didn't, I thought, you know, well I just didn't really care for either one of them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, Lambert, Ham,  and,  uh, Stallworth and Swan.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|absolutely,|aa
A|I can't disagree with that.|aa

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They really,|%
B|I, I, I like, not just with the Pittsburgh, I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the, the best plays from,  you  know, from the week or something.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|highlights, yeah.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I love watching that.|sd

A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact|sv
A|Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.|sv
A|Yeah,|%
A|well they make mistakes too, I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
A||%
B|it's  funny that more people don't get hurt. You know, especially, I would say the receivers,  when they're in  the air and they get tackled.|sv
A|Absolutely.|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|oh they,  They take such a beating.|%
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.|sv
A|Absolutely,|aa
A|I don't know how they do it.|sd
A|It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,|sv
A|it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.|sv
A|Oh, absolutely.|aa
A|They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.|sv
A|Gosh, what a beating,|sv
A|they really do take a beating,|sv
A|they really do.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator.|qo
A|I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|I, I'm knowing what, you know,|%
A|of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,|sv
A|I really am.|sv
A|He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.|sv
B|Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|he  doesn't even look like he's in shape.|sv
B|He's just so big, no one can move him.|sv
A|That's right, yeah,|ba
A|absolutely.|aa
A|There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't,|sv
A|I don't know, you know,|h
A|I,|%
A|probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.|sv
A|I, you know,|%
A|obviously not very fast.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way.|sv
A|As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird.|sv
A|I don't know,|h
A|Dallas has a guy, uh, his name is Nate Newton,|sd
A|now he has a real weight problem too.|sv
A|He fights it every single year,|sv
A|but, he manages to still keep playing,|sd
A|but,  he  has a terrible weight problem.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Wow.|ba
A|They|%
A|the coaches watch him all year long.|sd
A|They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But I guess most every team has has someone like that,|sv
A|I don't,|%
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.|sv
A|Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|you would, uh-huh.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, now who,|%
B|would you say that you have a|qy
B|I mean other than Dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback.|qy
B|I mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know.|sd
A|Oh, yeah,|ny
A|sure,|sd
A|well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|I I, I enjoy watching him play.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|his age is about to catch up with him though.|sv
A|He's no Spring chicken anymore.|sv
B|No,|b
B|but he's still performing.|sv
A|And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,|sv
A|Warren Moon's an  excellent.|sv

B|Yes he is,|aa
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|sure.|b
B|I, I,  I enjoy watching him also.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|absolutely.|aa
B|What about, uh, Marino?|qo
A|Uh, I'm,|%
A|obviously he's a very good quarterback,|h
A|I'd, I never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|he may, uh-huh.|sv
A|Yes|ny
A|he was,|sd
A|I believe that's right at one point in time.|sv
A|but he's a very young fellow.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.|sv
B|That's true,|ba
B|that's true.|ba
A|If not, he gets  beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,|sv
A|you|%
A|Dallas did better last year,|sv
A|hopefully they'll do better this year.|sv
B|to someone else in the Uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh.|t3
B|Yeah,|b
B|uh, I didn't, I don't know,|h
B|I, I just think, you know Marino will get better|sv
B|and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,  you know,|sv
A|That's right.|ba
B|so.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|Miami's had some down years, too.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But they all do, I guess,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah|b
B|That's true,|ba
B|and with age comes,  you know,|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|with|%
A|yeah,|%
B|the,  the|%
B|I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,  you know.|sv
A|Oh yes,  very much so.|aa
A|Hip injuries and things like that, yeah.|^2
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|and they're so young,|sv
A|That's right.|ba
B|but, they're  retired, you know,|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|I read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years.|sd
A|So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.|sv
B|Oh yeah,|b
B|but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.|sv
A|But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.|sd
A|that's|%
B|Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.|sv
A|That's, that's a pretty short career on average.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Um, what do you think of the, uh, L A Raiders,|qo
B|used to the, the Oakland?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws|sv
A|and,  if  their, if their, you know, arrest record won't let won't let them play anywhere else, they seem to go to, they seem to go to the Raiders.|sv

A|you know perception,|sv
A|I don't know.|h
B|Yeah.|b
A|Al  Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.|sv

A|They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.|sv
B|Yes,|aa

B|There you go.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials|sd
B|and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now my personal opinion,|sd
B|I don't know.|h
B|Uh, uh, here lately it seems,|sv
B|well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh,|sv
B|they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It's just not right.|sv
A|I think I agree with that very much.|sv
B|And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing.|sv
A|I,|%
A|do you,|qy
A|Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that,|qy
A|and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?|qy
B|Yes,|ny
B|very possibly.|sd
B|So many of us have led sheltered lives that, uh, when we go into a, sit in on, a jury,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I've never done it myself unfortunately,|sd
A|I never have either.|sd
B|I wish I could have.|sd
B|I've just never been called up.|sd
A|My husband works as a police man,|sd
A|so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.|sd
B|Well now, that's possible.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once,|sd
B|but I never made it to the jury.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?|qy
B|Not that I know of.|ng
A|Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury,|sd
A|and I had never heard of such thing,|sd
A|and I wondered if it was true.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
B|Uh, I've never heard of it.|sd
A|I never had either,|sd
A|but I just wondered. Uh,|sd
A|another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision,|sd
A|and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.|sd
B|Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.|sv
A|That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other.|qy^d
B|Exactly.|na
B|Is it guilt or innocence.|^2
B|But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,|sv
B|and, and it permits the criminal to get a retrial.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|And there,|%
B|that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I mean, that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to, uh, prove their innocence.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Bring some of these things out.|^2
B|Yes.|aa
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.|sv
A|Un, apparently there are.|sv
A|I, I, I,|%
A|since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.|sd
A|Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.|sv
B|Oh, that's it,|ba
B|and you just might resemble somebody.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.|sd
B|It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We had,|%
B|a Black man was accused simply because he resembled uh, someone who who held up, a, Seven Eleven, I think it was.|sd
A|Oh. Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work,|sd
B|and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,|sd
A|They still found him guilty?|qy^d
B|They found him guilty.|na
A|When people said he was at work?|qy^d
B|Well, they said it this, this happened during lunch time.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|But after nine years,|sd
B|well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.|sd
A|Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
A|So there's nine years of that man's life gone.|sd
B|Exactly.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Now that just was not fair.|sv
A|No,|aa
A|huh-uh.|b
B|So.|%
A|Yeah,|b
A|I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,|sv
A|we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.|sv
B|Yes.|b
A|And, And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.|sv
B|Unfortunately, that's what happens.|sv
B|Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,|sv
B|but it's the best one in the world.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|it's the best one that exists, I guess.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b

B|the Supreme Court,|%
B|well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.|sd

B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|see what they,|%
A|There's nobody holding them here.|sv
B|See how they'd like it under another flag.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|They'd soon be back,|sv
A|I'm sure.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I hope they get something out of this.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's,|sv
A|do you think that's good you know, like if a jury,|qy
B|Oh|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|but I think the jury should be able to recommend,|sv
A|Make a recommendation?|qy^d
B|Yes.|ny
A|Do they sometimes make a recommendation?|qy
B|Oh, yes,|ny
B|yes.|ny
A|That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.|sd
B|I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.|sd
B|But I know I'm always hearing that, uh,|sd
B|well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict|sd
B|and they recommended,  twenty years or  something.|sd
A|And they recommend.|^2
A|Yeah.|b
A|And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen. Yeah.|sd
B|Yes.|b
B|Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.|sd
A|Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,|sv
A|but actually, their chance, course, when,|sv
A|a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.|sv
A|It depends on you know, what they're, what they'd been guilty of, and a lot of different things, I guess.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole|sv
B|and,|%
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.|sv
A|And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.|sv
B|Yes.|b
B|They just go out and repeat their crimes.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Well there,|%
B|well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,|sd
B|but I think they ought to make it two offenses.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I always thought there was, there was wrong,|sv
A|it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good,|sv
A|the balance isn't right.|sv
A|It doesn't make sense.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|very true.|ba
B|Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Race or nationality even.|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,|sv
B|but it's the best one we've got.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|right.|b
A|So, let's put up with it, I guess.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.|sv
B|Sure enough.|ba
A|So.|%
B|Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.|fc
A|Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack,|fc
A|and I hope you have a real good day and week.|fc
B|Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.|fc
A|I hope not.|fc
B|Take care now.|fc
A|You, too.|fc
B|Bye.|fc
A|Bye-bye.|fc
A|All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?|qw
B|Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool|sd
B|and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy.|sd
B|It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I like that.|sd
B|Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it|sd
B|and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,|sd
B|but I just use those little cans of chicken.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And it makes it so much easier,|sd
B|and so you dump the rice,|sd
B|you dump the chicken|sd
B|and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,|sd
B|now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,|sd
B|but I get my kids to do that,|sd
B|so,|%
A|Oh|sd
B|I, I don't have to do that.|sd
B|And, um, and it really,|%
B|and you mix it all up with|sd
B|there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,|sd
B|but it's so simple|sd
B|and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|You serve it cold?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Oh, yeah,|bk
A|that sounds good.|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|it has to sit in the fridge over night,|sd
B|but, but it's really good.|sv
A|Um.|%
B|And I like that one.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue|sd
B|Exactly.|b
A|like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over|sd
A|and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba
A|And it was real good.|sd
A|You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way|sd
A|and then people think they're eating steak or something|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|And these days that helps, doesn't it?|qy
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|It really does.|sd
B|I know what you mean.|sd
A|I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.|sd
B|Now spaghetti's such an easy one.|sd
B|Um, I do that a lot.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I do spaghetti a lot.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it seems like most people like spaghetti.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|Because, um, I don't know,|h
B|I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I guess.|b
A|Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I think that's right.|sv
B|And, um, we don't entertain that often,|sd
B|but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|Most,|%
A|we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.|sd
A|It's usually friends from church and stuff,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things|sd
A|and everybody else brings something.|sd
B|That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,|sd
B|yeah.|aa
A|Oh yeah,|ba
A|yeah.|b
B|Uh.|%
A|It's a lot more relaxing.|sd
A|I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone.|sd
B|Well you see all that on T V|sd
B|and I could never be that person.|sd
A|Huh-uh.|b
B|It just, uh, I'm just not,|%
B|well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back.|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church|sd
B|and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff|sd
B|and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out|sd
B|and I don't know how she can do it and be calm|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|I guess,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Do you work?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I don't.|sd
A|Do you stay home with kids?|qy
B|Uh-huh,|ny
B|yeah.|ny
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I've been working,|sd
A|we're going to have a baby this summer,|sd
A|and I'm not going to work anymore.|sd
B|Oh, how exciting.|ba
A|Yeah.|b
A|So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day.|sd
A|I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up|sd
A|and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,|sd
A|so.|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Eat at six, yeah.|b^m
B|Yeah,|b
B|and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family.|sd
A|Oh, that's good.|ba
B|Uh, yeah,|b
B|I don't like the run in and out part.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened|sd
B|and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's neat.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things|sd
B|and I think that's good.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|that really is.|sv
A|It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|I think,|%
A|Right now we eat in front of the T V|sd
A|but since it's just the two of us, it's|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah|b
B|Well that happens to us sometimes too.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,|sd
B|but we eat in the kitchen|sd
B|and their heads are always poking past the door.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|to see what's happening.|^2
B|Yeah.|b
B|Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing|sv
B|and some people don't like to do this|sv
B|but I like to uh, cook with my kids.|sv
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help.|sd
B|And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,|sd
B|I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it.|sd
A|Oh, I've seen those in the magazines.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|they're so simple.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And the kids love to do that.|sd
B|Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that|sd
B|and it's just really hard|sd
B|and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So, that's, uh,|%
B|they like to eat it,|sd
B|but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
B|But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that.|sd
A|Oh yeah,|b
A|yeah,|b
A|we like that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|My son's getting to be a, a real good cook|sd
B|so, uh,|%
A|Oh, neat.|ba
B|sometimes he fixes me breakfast|sd
A|Oh, wow, that's great|ba
B|Yeah,|b
B|I like it,|sd
B|I like it a lot.|sd
A|How old is he?|qw
B|He's eleven.|sd
A|Eleven,|b^m
A|wow, that's good.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so|%
A|Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning|qy
A|or,|%
B|Uh, not every morning, uh,|ng
B|mostly during the summer it's hit and miss|sd
B|and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the they like it all right.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And, um, then sometimes we do something,|sd
B|it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,|sd
B|we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,|sd
B|but.|%
A|Oh, uh-huh,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|so, I try to, uh,|%
B|and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.|sd
B|I used to do them in the microwave,|sd
B|but they don't like that.|sd
A|Oh, do they get rubbery,|qy
A|or,|%
B|Um.|%
A|I've never tried it.|sd
B|It it depends.|no
B|If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray|sd
B|and they will be a little harder,|sd
B|and I don't like that.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,|sd
B|but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And let it steam.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And then, and then stir it up.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|an, and that turns out okay.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|sd
B|It's really funny,|sv
B|it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that, you know,|sd
A|Yeah|b
B|and yet if they don't ever see it, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Yeah.|b
B|Anyway.|%
A|We had,|sd
A|my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash.|sd
A|Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash,|sd
A|so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know,|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|and then we'd go, oh, this is really good.|sd
A|Hi|fp
A|you want to start first|ad
B|Of course.|aa
B|We are talking about the elderly and, uh, whether or not we we like nursing homes|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and, as a matter of fact, I can tell you something about that.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|You apparently have somebody there, in one.|qy^d
B|No,|nn
B|actually, my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years|sd
B|and her mother,|sd
A|Oh, you are kidding?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|she did.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home, for years. And then, uh, went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I will be darned.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.|sd
A|Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
B|So, I do know something about that.|sd
A|You are very, very much aware of what goes on.|sv
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|That is great.|ba
B|Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business, was that her mother was very old, and couldn't seem to find companions.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|She was lonely.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|And she needed company, for her mother|sd
A|Right.|b
B|and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies.|sd
A|I will be darned.|ba
B|And then, uh, it, it grew into a, very prosperous business from that point.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, then they,|%
A|Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.|sv
B|Well, that is not really true, either, uh,|ad
B|I think that is a stigma and an I, and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You see, those who had bad experiences talk about them.|sd
A|Uh, right,|b
A|right.|b
B|And those who do not may write, a letter to the nursing home and say you did good,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they do not talk a whole lot about that.|sd
A|That is true.|ba
A|But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home, when you are still able to have good, relationships with, maybe other friends they wait until they are, you know, unable.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Sure.|b
B|Well now, That is right.|ba
B|Well, that is because they wait until the children make those choices, they choose to not make those, choices themselves.|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|However, my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home.|sd
B|And these, these,|%
A|Uh, uh-huh.|b
B|I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her. "Well I am going for my, tennis lessons.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, would would you, you know, call down and have the van come around and take, us for our tennis lessons."|^q
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And they are very active and very enthusiastic|sd
B|and they have, some excellent programs right there on site.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|That is great.|ba
B|Or, or one of the lovely cafeterias.|sd
B|And they have, you know, pink linen napkins for their dinners. And, a well equipped library.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|that sounds great.|ba
B|Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home|sv
B|and I think when the, the parent gets old enough, to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping house, and with taking care of themselves, anymore. That is a wonderful alternative.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|It is expensive.|sv
B|It is costly.|sv
A|See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it is, you, know.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, now my daddy's mother, uh, lived in a, a retirement village|sd
B|and she and her sister had side by side duplexes, one bedroom duplex.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She still had her individuality,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but they were there close|sd
B|and they did have, uh, you know, the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems|sd
B|and, there were lights that you could flip on and so forth.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And they have security.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|No,|b
B|I am very much in favor,|sd
B|I have heard horror stories,|sd
A|Oh, well you have that with anything.|sd
B|I know that the elderly can easily be abused,|sd
A|Oh yeah .|b
B|but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are, they are in, homes of their own children.|sd
A|In the homes, yeah.|^2
A|Well, we used our nursing home as, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|like when my sister was real bad before she died uh, we took her the last month and a half, into a nursing home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they were super with her.|sd
B|Absolutely.|aa
A|They were, uh,|sd
B|Well now, my grandmother,|sd
B|of course all of my folks lived to be very old|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease, when she was in her late eighties, uh, late seventies, I mean.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She went to the doctor,|sd
B|she had surgery,|sd
B|she got the treatments|sd
B|and during, the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|She got better,|sd
B|she got well,|sd
B|she got out and went dancing again.|sd
A|Well, a lot of people do that.|sd
A|They , left them temporally maybe they had a, broken hip or something or,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That is right.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|I think it is a wonderful interim place,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital, problems|sv
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and yet it is not, you know,|sv
B|you have,|%
A|And it can become home to them.|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|It, It depends upon the individual.|sv
B|It certainly is.|ba
B|It certainly does,|ba
B|but, you see, we have had excellent experience with that.|sd
B|And, uh, I, I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill,|sd
B|but, I would not object to going to one.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|I might, I might like to be, uh, coherent enough to make my own choice.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say, "well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and, then dump me there.|sd
A|This is|%
A|and,|%
B|But, I would  like,|%
A|There has to be  consideration taken on everything.|sv
B|That is right.|ba
B|Uh-huh,|aa
B|uh-huh.|aa
B|And I think you would shop for a nursing home, just like you would shop for a church, or a doctor or anything else.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|That is right,|ba
A|you would look into it thoroughly and, do, do the best job you could in choosing one.|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|sure.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|When you get to the point where you are in trouble, and you have got to have that help, you are in no position to make those choices.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|No|b
A|and you do not have the time to look,|sv
A|that is what, I am saying,|sd
B|That is right.|ba
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.|sv
B|Absolutely.|ba
B|I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day, and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft programs, perhaps, work on some music programs,  whatever their talents are.  And work with, those senior citizens.|ad
A|Whatever their talents,  yeah.|b^m
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I have a cousin who is, uh,|sd
A|she had a son that was epileptic from birth,|sd
A|and he did fine, at home,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|they lived on a farm,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone, she did not want her, her children, her other children burdened with his care.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|That is right.|ba
A|So he, they, she has made arrangements that when she, she was gone, that he would go into the nursing home.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And he has, I would say, he adjusted very well|sd
A|and, uh, he, he, he has been there quite a long time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, he don't know me usually|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, he goes wheeling down, uh, the hall to bingo.|sd
A|Somebody else, is helping him out, you know,|sd
B|That is right.|ba
B|Uh. Well, one of the things, I think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine.|sv
A|and, uh, he has adjusted very well.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|oh yes.|aa
A|Yes.|aa
B|Routine and, uh, constancy.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh|b
B|Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over.|sd
B|I do not think they pay, the nursing home staff sufficiently, to, to get the dedication that they have in some other profession,|sv
A|uh-huh.|b
A|To keep them there, uh-huh.|^2
A|True.|ba
B|and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,|sv
A|Yes.|b
A|But , for some reason people resist, uh, the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing, you know.|sv
B|And, uh,|%
B|That is right.|ba
A|It seems to be a resistance.|sv
B|Care for the elderly and care for the children, I cannot imagine a more costly and a more, a more, uh, better area to invest, your money.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
A|But there seems to be a resistance.|sv
B|You are  preserving your heritage and your future there.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
A|So, uh,|%
B|And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes.|sv
A|Well, around here, we have some, you know, the churches, take your, the children|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, I know our kids thoroughly,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|the children thoroughly enjoy,|sd
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Scott, let's, uh, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university|ad
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you have any?|qy
A|and,|%
B|Do you have any kids|qy
B|or,|%
A|I have some, yes, some children.|sd
A|I have three boys.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And they're all quite young|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and so we want to plan for their education|sd
A|or we're saving right now|sd
A|and we're getting bonds, and, and, uh, and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to.|sd
A|How about yourself?|qo
A|Do you have any kids?|qy
B|No,|nn
B|I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now|sd
A|So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college.|sd
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah,|aa
B|definitely.|aa
B|In fact, I'm even going, uh, selecting again for, for my P H D.|sd
B|It's, it's a close subject right now|sd
A|Very good.|ba
B|Uh,|%
A|What, uh, what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to?|qw
B|Well I use, uh, uh, uh, I have used, uh, several techniques depending on what,|sd
B|for undergraduate, I, I, you know, my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, when I, when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know, rather small and easy to get around, you know. And what I would, what I thought would be easy to get through.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah|b
A|what you thought, huh.|bf
B|Yeah|aa
B|And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you know, it changed a whole lot.|sd
B|I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh, graduate with a little, you know, with a name behind me, rather than, uh|sd
A|Just the degree itself.|^2
B|yeah,|aa
B|yeah.|aa
A|Well, that's a, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable that you didn't have a lecture, uh, hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, uh, but you, I felt that I got a pretty good, uh, undergraduate, uh,|sd
B|Where, where did you go?|qw
A|I went to Utah State University which is in Logan, Utah|sd
B|Okay.|bk
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the nice thing about it too is, I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their business, College of Business, was accredited|sd
A|and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And so I, I feel like, number one, you you also need to see what kind of name the,|sd
A|like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you and another thing that, uh, another reason why I chose that was the, the finances.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through four, three years of the undergraduate work and, and have to leave.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family with, uh, counselors at high school, and also read some, some books on, on the subject at the, at the library.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, it was kind of unusual because my, my two older brothers and I all went to three different universities, depending on what our choice was.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Right.|b
A|Hopefully we, we chose the one that was best for us,|sd
A|and I, I felt very comfortable and good about that.|sd
A|So.|%
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able,|qy
B|I mean, obviously you've taken precautions, you know, or measures to, uh, try and pay for your children's education,|sd
B|but do you think that that's going to be enough?|qy
A|I don't think so.|ng
B|No.|b^m
A|I don't know.|no
A|The, the way that tuition is increasing, um, exponentially it's, it's, it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, uh,|%
B|I, all I, all I can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy university.|sd
A|And that, that your children can use the benefits of that university.|sv
B|Yeah|aa
A|Well, that's an excellent idea,|ba
A|that's an excellent idea.|ba
A|One thing that, uh, that we did, uh, and my parents, and our family, is that we weren't able to afford, um, the kind of education that we all desired.|sd
A|So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and and save and, and, and get.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Also, my, my brother, um, he's a, he's a medical doctor right now.|sd
A|He had to, you know,|sd
A|once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had to take out some loans,|sd
A|and he's, he's working to pay those off.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial stages of it, that there's different options you can use|sv
A|and, and, uh the student loans are, are good options.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's what, that's my biggest option right now.|sd
A|Yeah|b
A|Yes,|b
A|and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not,|sv
A|Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I'll let you go ahead|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|I, uh, I have five children all together.|sd
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world|sd
B|and I, uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|and, uh, my youngest is twelve.|sd
A|That's great.|ba
A|I always thought it'd be great to have twins.|sd
B|Uh, yeah.|b
B|If you like doing everything twice|sv
A|Well, yeah|b
B|Uh, at any rate, um, my first two children, uh, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, uh, a full-time job that, was more than a full-time job.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I, worked about fifty-one hours a week, because I worked every, worked eleven hours every Sunday.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to.|sd
A|Your first ones you mean, it, was this way?|qy
B|Yeah.|ny
B|The,|%
B|yeah,|ny
B|the|%
B|well, it was with all of them,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it was, uh, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because, um, oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, when the twins were about three years old.|sd
B|And, uh, they never, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much.|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|You know, with all the children around the house, it's, kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around, very much.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, so, what I've tried to do, uh, now that I've, uh,|sd
B|went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours, a week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, what I'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time.|sd
B|I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.|sd
B|Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies.|sd
B|There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the, movies.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, it's working out pretty well.|sd
B|Um, we're spending more time together.|sd
B|I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, uh,|sd
B|I have one son who's gone|sd
B|and I don't even know where he's at.|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|Um, he's taken off for parts unknown,|sd
A|That's difficult.|ba
B|but, uh, yeah.|aa
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, my daughter is, um, has moved out of the house.|sd
B|Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house|sd
A|Uh-huh|b
A|It happens that way|sd
B|And uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,|sd
B|and I think it's important that we do, because, uh, I notice that, uh, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I noticed parents not spending time with their, children and, and going out and doing things.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine|sd
B|and, you know, it just, you know,|%
A|Um, uh-huh.|b
B|I saw the family falling apart down, there.|sd
A|Texas is, much worst for the drugs.|sv
A|I mean, it was bad enough every place else,|sv
A|but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And I'm doing my best to keep that up.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, that's all you can do.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|What's your, been your experience?|qw
A|Well, I, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?|qy
B|Um, she didn't up until the last, oh, six months.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um.|%
A|She just recently started working then.|qy^d
B|She just recently, started working.|na
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house|sd
B|and, uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient.|sd
B|And, uh, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|So, that sounds great.|ba
A|Well, uh, we also have five children.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|And, but ours are all out of the nest|sd
A|So, uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things like you had, you know, having the time.|sd
A|When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, uh,|sd
A|and those activities helped a lot in, giving us things to do with the children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And uh, we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive.|sd
A|And, uh, our youngest is, uh, expecting her first baby.|sd
A|So, they're, they're all out and on their own.|sd
A|They're,|%
A|and we have one to get married yet|sd
A|And they'll all be married.|sd
A|Uh, and they're, they're all doing pretty good.|sd
A|They, uh,|%
A|T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.|qy^d
B|Certainly do.|na
A|Okay.|bk
A|Two of our children live there.|sd
A|Uh, one, I, like I said, lives near in, in around Maryland, D C.|sd
A|He works right on the border of D C.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And one lives in Connecticut skips on Speaker A's|sd
A|and our baby lives just a mile over the hill so, we'll get to see her a little more than, uh, what we do the other ones.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|That sounds great.|ba
B|I've, I've noticed, uh, another thing, um, when I was younger my father was always working.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, they have to.|sd
B|And,|%

B|And, uh, you know, he, uh, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I never saw him.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by. You, know, to learn how to be a, a father and, a parent, and that kind of thing, because, I, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or, catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.|sd
A|To go, to follow.|^2

A|I mean, life's much more difficult than that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, mean, the, the, the capability to, uh, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, uh, the mental capacity to raise them|sv
A|And, uh,|%

A|Now, our daughter, our, well, she's our second oldest, she has, she's the only that, other one that has children.|sd

A|She's able to do that|sd
A|and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home.|sd
A|But, yet, on the other hand, I, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children.|sd
A|I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|But they seem to, they seem to give, uh, quality time to those children when they are together.|sd
A|And, and so, it seems, it seems for them that it works out all right.|sd
A|So, I don't know.|h
A|I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.|sd
B|Yes.|b

B|Well, I'm|%
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|you want to tell me first how you feel about the proposal,|ad
B|Well um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service|sv
A|The boys|sd
B|right,|aa
B|the boys|sd
A|not the girls, the boys.|sd
B|yeah,|b
B|and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people you know, to be able to, to do something like that um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good for them to do that.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|I, I thought it would be good, too,|sv
A|but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done.|sv
B|Oh, sure.|b
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of um, public service things that they could do uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Yes,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|I think it would be that.|sv
A|When they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,|qy
A|or are they actually,|qy
A|why, why, why did they call it a proposal,|qw
A|that,|%
B|Oh, I think they just gave it a title|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or in work some|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|That's what I wondered.|sd
B|yeah,|b
B|no, no,|nn
B|it's not,|sd
B|it's just a, just a topic,|sd
A|It'd be good character builder.|sv
B|I think so, too.|aa
B|I think so, too.|aa
B|Um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,|sv
B|so I think it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people|sv
A|Right.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so, um, yeah,|%
B|it would be, it'd be really good I think.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is, is good.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Oh, yeah,|aa
B|oh yeah,|aa
B|I agree with you.|sv
B|This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and,|%
A|Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people, how they live|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|or,|%
B|Oh, I agree with you,|aa
B|I agree with you,|aa
B|and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are|sv
B|Right.|b
A|they have to see for themselves|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,|sv
A|I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.|sv
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|I would think so, like right after, um, high school you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school you know,  three months,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Of course  they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school|sv
B|Right,|b
B|right,|b
B|You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school|sv

B|you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now if they're not focused on going to college,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Kind of an in-between time.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But as for its being required you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh type of a system. Um.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Huh-uh.|b
A|No,|aa
A|and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,|sv
A|but not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean it's disaster if they don't go,|sv
B|Right.|b
A|but but some of them are not,|sv
B|Oh, right.|b
A|they're just not made to do that type of thing|sv
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|and they just aren't able to do it.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah,|b
B|so, um, yeah,|b
B|it'd be good|sv
B|but like I said, requiring it would be, uh,|sv
A|Doug, you want to start?|ad
B|Sure.|aa
A|You don't use any credit cards, I don't imagine.|qy^d
B|No.|nn
B|Of course I use, credit cards.|sd
B|I have a couple of credit cards and, uh, use them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|do you use them a lot?|qy
B|Oh, we try not to.|ng
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We're on a pretty strict and tight budget.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We use the credit cards, however, when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Or we use credit cards also, if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing.|sd
B|So. So, yes,|%
A|Oh, well, that's an idea,|ba
A|that's a thought,|ba
A|uh-huh.|b
B|and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where, you know, they don't take local, they don't take out of state checks|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so when we're traveling some.|sd
B|Do you use credit cards often?|qy
A|My husband loves them|no
A|Uh, we do use them.|sd
A|Uh, we try not to,|sd
A|but, he, he's one who believes in credit cards,|sd
A|and he uses them quite a bit.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month|sd
B|Oh, yeah,|b
B|well that's, that's a good thing, because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month|sv
A|He, he likes that,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they just pay the minimum required balance.|sd
A|And that's when you get into expenses.|sv
B|Yes,|aa
B|and you get in over your head.|sv
A|Right.|aa
B|It'll, uh,|%
B|some people I know also try to use it as float where they buy something now|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and say, well, I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale|sd
B|and then I can go ahead and pay for it when I get my check at the end of the month|^q
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|when I'm being paid.|^q
A|Right.|b
A|Well, sometimes you do come on bargains and that,|sd
A|and it's really useful.|sv
B|That's true.|aa
A|And some places won't take, you know, like personal checks or cash, even|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but they would take a credit card.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|How how are the laws in Pennsylvania, uh, as, as regard, well not the laws, but the rates, credit card rates in Pennsylvania?|qo
B|For example down here, when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|Are they the same there?|qy
A|We,|%
A|yeah,|ny
A|we have the same thing up here,|sd
A|so we don't deal where they do that|sd
A|We you know, we go to places where they don't charge extra.|sd
A|Some of them charge five cents a gallon, even,|sd
A|like the gas stations more,|sd
B|That's pretty steep.|ba
A|And, uh, we just try to avoid, you know, the ones that do that,|sd
A|we just don't, uh, go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|extra because actually, to me, credit cards are the same as cash,|sd
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
A|to me they are, anyway,|sd
B|Yes,|aa
B|because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase|sd
B|and, and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry|qy
A|Right.|aa
A|Right,|aa
A|yeah.|aa
A|Yes.|aa
A|Yeah,|ny
A|right.|na
B|Very good.|ba
B|You're, you're one of the good, I guess, good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money.|sd
A|Well, I can't say we never have.|sd
A|Now we have, you know, at times, made payments on our things,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but we try not to.|sd
A|We try hard,|sd
B|Well, yeah,|b
B|well, I see that as an advantage to a credit card, also|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Right.|b
B|So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|because sometimes, uh, there's times when you may, maybe couldn't take advantage of something|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but with a credit card you can.|sv
A|So.|%
B|Uh-huh,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Um, do you have, uh, multiple credit cards?|qy
A|Uh.|%
B|And do you find that advantageous|qy
B|or,|qy
A|Well, I think we're narrowing it down, actually.|sd
A|Uh, uh, like I said, my husband likes them,|sd
A|and we have quite a few,|sd
A|but we really get, when you get down to the nitty gritty, there's probably three that we use most of the time.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Right.|b
B|We're, we're actually in the same boat.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|We like to use three, uh, basic credit cards.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That way we're not confused|sd
B|and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And, do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail?|qy
A|Oh, yes.|ny
B|Once a week,|sd
B|twice a week,|sd
B|or three times a week.|sd
A|Well, it's not every week,|sd
A|but you, you do get them.|sd
A|They make it very readily available.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Almost too much so.|sv
A|But I I really don't like it the charges that, you know,|sd
A|we try to limit, look at that also,|sd
A|what they charge per year to use our money, you know|sd
B|Right,|b
B|so the annual fee.|bf
B|Right,|b
B|right,|b
A|they're charging us to spend our money,|sd
A|and, I, I'm not real crazy about that,|sd
A|so we try to look at that also.|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent uh, based upon what the state will allow,|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|Right.|b
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.|sd
B|Good.|bk
A|Did  you hear the questions that the lady, uh, brought up?|qy
B|Yes.|ny
A|Such as how much time, well,|qy^d
A|I'll ask,|oo_co_cc
A|how much time do you spend with your children,|qw
A|and how many do you have?|qw
B|We have two children,|sd
B|they're both grown and married|sd
B|and with, we have, uh,|%
B|our daughter has three sons,|sd
B|so we see them at least once a week,|sd
B|and we see our son and his wife uh, about every other week|sd
B|and, uh we baby-sit quite frequently.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So we're a fairly close-knit family.|sd
B|We're together a lot on special days|sd
B|and, uh, and of course, with the holidays and everything.|sd
A|Well, you're very fortunate.|ba
A|Uh, my my, uh,|%
A|I have two girls and a son,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And  my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|She  Her husband builds pianos,|sd
A|so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to.  Because  we've, we, one thing we do have together is we're both musicians.|sd
B|Oh,  yes.|ba
A|I play in several symphony orchestras|sd
A|and,  she is  a, a, a concert, uh, harpsichordist. And travels around a good bit in Europe.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Oh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, her husband builds forte pianos,|sd
A|which are harpsichord size  pianos.|sd
B|Pianos,  uh-huh.|b^m
A|And, uh, that's why they're over there.|sd
A|And then I have a, a son who lives in, uh, Warrington, Pennsylvania.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And I get to see him maybe once every three months.|sd
A|So I really, we've lost, you know,|sd
A|I'd like to have an everyday contact with children, uh, as well as you do, for that matter,|sd
A|and my young , my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey,|sd
A|and so  they,   I don't hardly  get to see any of them.|sd
B|Oh,  you don't get to see any of  yours very often.|bf
A|She works in these, um, Trump type casinos,|sd
A|she and her husband  both do.|sd
A|They work,  uh, they're really both, um play, people who play on stage|sd
B|Yes,|b
B|uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and, uh, they're running lights right now and audio and that thing  for,  plays and things that go on.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But anyhow uh,|%
A|what do you, what activities do you do with your children when you are together?|qw
B|Oh, most the  time,|%
B|well, right now it's football season,|sd
B|and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan,|sd
B|as is our husband,|sd
B|so, my husband,|%
B|so she watches that|sd
B|and I play with the grandchildren|sd

B|But, now, like last weekend, um, there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas,|sd
B|and it ends,  uh,  in January,|sd
A|Oh.|b
B|so she and, and the three boys and my husband and I went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit|sd
B|and this  Sunday,|%
A|The Soviet  space  exhibit?|qy
B|Uh-huh.|ny
A|My goodness.|ba
B|Yeah Oh, it's been here for quite, uh, some time.|aa
A|I am surprised they would bring anything over here.|sv
B|I think it came here in either September or October|sd
B|and,  it's very interesting,  very interesting,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'll bet.|ba
B|and it's been very well done|sv
B|Uh, and this, uh, next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game|sd
B|and,  uh,  uh, we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santa's village.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, uh, then when our son's over, we have a pool,|sd
B|and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends,|sd
B|and we have cookouts on Sunday  uh,|sd
A|Well,  that sounds like you have  really,  wonderful activities that keep you together.|ba
B|And, uh  we, we do a lot with with our kids,|sd
B|and we we always have.|sd
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. *slash error, should be 'b'|b
B|We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger.|sd
B|Uh, we're very family oriented.|sd
B|We, um,  we like  being with our kids,|sd
B|and the kids seem to enjoy being with us,|sd
B|and their friends enjoy being with us.|sd
B|So which that keeps us very, very young, with all these young people passing in and out and  eating,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and  seems like I've,|%
A|The only  problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,|sv
A|doesn't it?|^g
B|Well, it does|na
B|I'm worried about Christmas.|sd
B|Christmas Eve they all pass through,|sd
B|and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night, so  that,  we open our presents on Christmas day|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Beautiful.|ba
B|and they go out to the other, you know, the in-laws in between some of this,|sd
B|but they're  all,  with us,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things,|sd
B|so we see a lot of them.|sd
B|But we enjoy Christmas Eve night, because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock,|sd
B|and we open presents about five o'clock  Christmas,  morning,|sd
B|and, you know, and, uh,  then,  I go to the kitchen and cook,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and my sister and, and her husband are coming down,|sd
B|so there's going to be eleven of us  for Christmas.|sd
A|That's great.|ba
A|There's a,|%
A|the question now to ask, is it difficult to find time,|sd
A|and you seem to be making out all right.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Sometimes I'm a little exhausted|sd
A|Well, tell me,|ad
A|what do you think of, uh, of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children  and so forth?|qo
B|Oh, I,  I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.|sv
B|I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.|sv
B|I think, I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was  there  for about, uh, I don't know, eight or nine years.|sv
A|Yes.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.|sv
B|Parents kind of went and did their thing,|sv
B|kids did their thing. Yes,|sv
A|Well, that's|%
A|no,|aa
A|that's exactly what I was going to say.|aa
A|Of, of course, I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in detail.|sd
B|uh-huh.|b
A|I know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and, and learn much more so than my own kids.|sd
A|When, when your own children are growing up, you just take them for granted|sv
A|and you go ahead and do your thing|sv
A|and,|%
A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Well, she lives in Utah,|sd
B|so.|%
A|Oh, uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
A|That's the way we always were.|sd
A|We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.|ad
B|Okay,|aa
B|let's do|ad
A|So, you ready?|qy
A|My children are all gone already.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're, they're all out on their own.|sd
A|So, uh, do you want to start first do you work?|ad
B|Okay.|aa
B|No,|nn
B|I don't,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I stay home most of the time|sd
B|but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Um, you know, there's a,|%
B|my neighbor she tends children though|sd
B|and, and, um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, um, have a, a a law to have them certified or, or not.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that|sv
A|Right.|b
B|because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to be on , get an okay seal.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|but yet most of the problems we hear,|sd
A|of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|You know, the individual incidence or something.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, now, usually when I have someone tend, um,|sd
B|my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere|sd
B|but,|%
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|how old, is your oldest?|qw
B|before,|%
B|He's almost a teenager|sd
A|Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|he's, he's very good.|sd
B|Um, but, um, before that I would, I would use, uh, kids from our church,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they did a good job, for me.|sd
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|Um, but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center, or anything,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home.|sd
A|That's the way with me.|aa
A|I, I worked four years one time,|sd
A|but my last two children were, uh, both entering high school age.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, they were, of course, gone while I was working|sd
A|so it wasn't a problem I saw,|sd
A|and I stayed home the rest of the time.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|I, so I didn't have that problem either.|sd
A|Now I have, I,|%
A|my oldest daughter she has two children|sd
A|and they've been in day care, uh,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|she works full time.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|that's hard.|bf
A|It, it's difficult|sd
A|but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.|sd
B|Well, some people aren't.|ba
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|She, she surprised me though.|sd
A|She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with, with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.|sd
B|Oh, is that, is that right?|bh
A|So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with, with the children.|sd
B|I think that's really important.|ba
A|And, uh, they've used the day care most of the time.|sd
A|They tried one once.|sd
A|They had a lady come in.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.|sd
A|And it did not work out. Uh, at all|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|It, she thought it was going to.|sd
A|She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out, in the morning,|sd
B|Yeah,|aa
B|uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, the lady called|sd
A|and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble.|sd
A|And this baby is the, is the most pleasant, uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually.|sd
A|And, and she was having problems with her,|sd
A|and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|Well, my daughter decided to call them and check|sd
A|and things weren't okay|sd
B|Oh.|ba
A|Her, her one son was watching the soapies|sd
A|which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,|sd
B|Oh, dear.|ba
A|and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.|sd
B|Oh.|ba
A|And so that ended that, episode,|sd
B|Yeah.|ba
A|and she was most upset, uh, over finding this.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I bet.|ba
A|So, uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better.|sd
A|There's, uh, more people involved,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|more than one adult they,|sd
A|and the age groups are separated Uh-huh.|sd
B|Well, nannies have been an option, uh,|sd
B|but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like maybe in, uh, preschool would have where they have lessons and, so forth, and so on.|sd
A|Yes,|b
A|story time, uh,|^2
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and the, this one has been particularly nice.|sd
A|It, uh, it kept track of what they did,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and they would tell the parents what they did that day.|sd
A|You know, if they said anything or did anything.|sd
A|So it kind of kept them,|sd
B|Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,  uh, on  people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
B|Yeah.|aa
A|Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,|sv
A|if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.|sv
B|Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,|sv
A|They may not say anything.|sv
B|Right,|aa
B|right.|aa
A|And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.|sv
B|You can't really.|aa
B|You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and usually they aren't at that age. Uh-huh.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and decide.|sv
B|Well, I know I, uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children. And, uh, you know, I, I wondered if I would have to be certified|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|or whether they'd just bring them|sd
B|and and we got to where, well, we were just friends|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh-huh,|b
A|uh-huh.|b
B|And then if there was a problem|sd
B|and then we'd sit down, and talk about it|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it never happened, to be a problem,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, and so things worked out okay,|sd
B|and their kids played with my kids|sd
B|and it worked out well.|sd
A|it worked out good.|bf
A|I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|Since they'll be going back at the end of the month.|sd
A|And so, I'm going to give it a try.|sd
B|That's great.|ba
A|I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,|sd
B|Oh, uh-huh.|b
A|and I've got that worked out.|sd
A|My husband, he's retired|sd
A|so he's going to deliver my products|sd
A|so I'll do my orders and that by phone.|sd
B|Well, that will be great.|ba
A|So, um, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I I think I'll enjoy doing ,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|I, I think I'll enjoy.|sv
B|Yeah.|aa
A|I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something|sd
B|Sure,|ba
B|why not. That's right.|bh
A|Yeah.|aa
A|Right.|aa
A|That's right|aa
A|Well, they do say you enjoy them more,|sv
A|a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first|sd
B|Well, uh, my husband's mother lives right over here,|sd
B|and she takes care of them sometimes, for me,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, and just is a lovely lady,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|My daughter, always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.|sd
B|And,|%
B|Oh|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first|sv
