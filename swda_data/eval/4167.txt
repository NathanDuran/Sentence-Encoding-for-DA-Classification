A|it's, uh,|%
A|I'll start off here.|oo_co_cc
A|Uh, I don't know.|h
A|I get, probably, most of my information either from the newspaper or from C N N.|sd
A|Uh, I like C N N because it, uh, you know, repeats it,|sd
A|well HEADLINE NEWS repeats every half hour|sd
A|but it makes it really convenient cause I keep a rather hectic schedule|sv
B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|and, uh,|%
A|but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from,|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|I, I think I'd agree.|aa
B|A, a similar method of getting the news with me too.|sd
B|It's, uh, uh, C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the, last, uh, number of years.|sd
B|Uh, prior to cable, you know, you didn't get much news off of normal, uh, television broadcasts.|sv
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, just usually pretty local in, in nature|sv
B|and, and I like, uh, C N N because you get some world, world events too uh, which is not too common on, on the other format, newspapers, and so forth.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|I know, the,|%
A|my only major objection is that, uh, I don't think American media spends enough, uh, attention on, on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada.|sv
A|Uh,|%
B|That, that's true, you know.|aa
B|You hardly ever see, uh, headline articles about the, uh, either the economics or, or other news events going on in either of those countries.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|Uh, whereas if you pick up a, a European paper, you know, uh, it, all the surrounding countries, Soviet Union, and everything has, uh, major news, uh, articles in them.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|Yeah.|b
A|I mean, you know, Canada has gone through a lot of problems now with, with Quebec and, and everything|sd
A|and, uh, it's amazing that,|sv
A|you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,|sd
A|I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, you know.|%
B|I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas|sd
B|and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>.|sd
B|You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,|sd
B|uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,|sv
B|and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand.|sv
B|And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico.|sv
A|Yeah,|aa
A|definitely.|aa
B|You just don't know what's going on.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|I'd, I,|%
B|every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas|sd
B|and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C|sd
B|and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too.|sv
B|You you can tune into some stations|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events.|sd
B|Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area|sd
B|and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.|sd
B|There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries.|sv
B|I hadn't really thought about it|sd
B|but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.|sv
A|Right.|aa
A|Exactly.|aa
A|Yeah.|aa
A|I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada.|sd
A|Uh, well part of it, touring.|sd
A|And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on.|sv
A|There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and I had never heard any of that before.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|you know, there was, a, a,|%
B|what is it called,|qw
B|is it Meech Lake Accord?|qy
A|Uh-huh.|ny
B|Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of|sv
B|and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it.|sd
B|And, and came|%
B|it was a big thing going on there|sd
B|and I came back here|sd
B|and nothing in the papers.|sd
A|Right,|b
A|right.|b
B|I didn't see a thing about it.|sd
B|So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess.|sv
B|It's improved.|sv
B|And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news.|sd
B|Even, even there's, uh, uh,|%
B|it's it's semireligious in some respects.|sd
B|But what is it?|qw
B|It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,|sd
B|uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel.|sd
B|The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh, I, it surprised me.|sd
B|I've caught it a few times|sd
B|and they, they do some pretty good news.|sd
B|Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts.|sd
B|Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|You'd think it would carry mostly religious|sv
B|but it, it doesn't seem to.|sv
B|So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering.|sd
B|Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries.|sd
B|But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show.|sd
A|I used to get the, uh,|sd
