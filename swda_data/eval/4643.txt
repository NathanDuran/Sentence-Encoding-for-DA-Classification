B|Uh, how about yourself?|qo
A|Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking.|sd
A|I don't have lots of tools.|sd
A|Our local schools have adult education in the evening|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance.|sd
A|I'm an artist.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|b
A|And I'm very handy|sd

B|That's great.|ba
B|What, what type of art do you focus on?|qw
A|I have a Master's degree|sd
A|and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,|sd
A|but I'm really interested in the crafts.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|I make stain glass.|sd
A|I've done some silver jewelry making|sd
A|and I kind of,|sd
A|once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Kind of jack of all trades, master of none.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|well no,|ar
A|actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,|sd
A|you didn't buy it,|sd
A|you made it.|sd
B|That's great!|ba
A|And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone|%
A|so let's do something else.|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|You want to, uh, explore a new field|bf
B|or, or,|%
A|Well,  yeah,|aa
A|I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet|sd
B|Huh.  So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?|qw
A|but,|%
A|Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art|sd
A|and it's in art education.|sd
B|Oh, okay.|bk
A|So, I'm a licensed teacher|sd
A|but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and that way I have time for my kids too.|sd
A|And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.|sv
A|I don't know how long that's going to last|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
A|And, uh, they're cutting back,|sd
A|so I don't go in all that often|sd
A|but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things.|sd
A|Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars|sd
A|and I say, oh no|sd
A|and , and I go|sd
A|and I make it.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That's how I started jewelry making.|sd
A|I, I love to cook.|sd
B|Oh, that's great.|ba
A|And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff|sd
A|and I went|sd
A|and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you|sd
A|and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.|sd
B|Exactly.|aa
A|And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars|sd
A|It took me a lot of time|sd
A|but  it didn't,|sd
B|Oh,  yeah.|b
A|but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,|sd
A|and then I,|%
B|And your time,|^2
B|then you're that much farther ahead|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.|sd
A|It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.|sd
B|Right.|b
B|I've seen them|sd
B|and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in|sd
B|and,|sd
A|Oh, yeah.|b
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|That's neat.|sv
A|I went there,|sd
A|we have Home Depot out here.|sd
A|I don't know if you've heard of it.|qy^d
A|I went|sd
A|and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.|sd
B|Yes.|ny
B|We have one.|sd
A|I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath|sd
A|and cutting that wedge out was no joke|sd
B|Huh.|b
B|Oh, I'm, I'm sure.|ba
A|We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd
B|A band saw?|qy^d
B|What?|br
A|I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And the teacher was one of these negative people,|sd
A|oh that's dangerous,|^q
A|we can't do that,|^q
A|we just can't do that.|^q
A|And I'm going well how about this way?|sd
A|I, I want to do that,|^q
A|that was the plan here|^q
B|Right.|b
A|So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.|sd
B|A cradle for it.|^2
B|Yeah,|b
B|so you can steady it|bf
B|and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?|qy
A|Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw|sd
A|but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that|sd
B|Right,|b
B|right.|b
A|and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.|sd
A|I said I'm not that steady,|sd
A|it's not going to happen.|^q
B|Yeah.|b
A|So we built a cradle for it|sd
A|and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,|sd
A|by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about|sd
B|Right.|b
A|So,|%
B|Now  did you cut a quarter wedge in this?|qy
A|Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.|ng
A|You know|%
B|Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log|sd
B|and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,|%
B|it's, uh,|sd
B|if you're looking at adding on you have,|sd
