B|Clanking ishes oman and children|%
A|Well, as much as I'd, uh, I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or, uh, or a four by four or something,|sd
A|I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door|sd
B|What kind of a car do you have now?|qw
A|Oh, we've got a, uh, an older Delta Eighty-Eight,|sd
A|and then, uh, our, our newer car is a, uh, a Corsica.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we'll probably be looking for something about that, uh, that same style.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|That same kind of four door, hard top style.|sd
B|You got kids?|qy
A|Uh, no|nn
A|but we're planning for it.|sd
B|Okay.|bk
A|So, uh, in fact, uh, our Oldsmobile is a, is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight|sd
A|but it's in pretty good in really good shape.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|So that's probably where the first place we'd look.|sd
B|Huh.|b
A|But, uh,|%
B|Well, we've always had, uh, Fords.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh, mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership|sd
A|That'll do it.|ba
B|Yeah.|b
B|That'll do it.|sd
B|Um, but, yeah, we're, we're in the same shape.|sd
B|I think our next car will be a, you know, some big old four door, uh, something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons,|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|and we've got a minivan,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and that's great.|sv
B|And I drive, uh,|%
B|well I used to drive an Escort,|sd
B|but it died on me.|sd
B|So I, I mean I, I, I used to run it, I, uh, where we used to live, I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day.|sd
A|Oh, geez.|ba
B|And, uh, and this Escort took it all.|sd
B|And it, it, it got up to, uh, uh, I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it,|sd
B|and the engine just went.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I, I, I bought a used, uh, Dodge Aries, which has been okay.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
A|Really?|bh
B|I, I mean I've haven't had it that long.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|But it, it it's an eighty-five Aries,|sd
B|but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it.|sd
A|Oh, geez.|ba
B|And I just, you know, I just drive it to work.|sd
B|So it's just a ten minute commute every day.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So, uh, it doesn't get much of, uh,|sd
B|I mean, it's not like I'm putting it through its paces.|sv
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|But I think, uh,|%
B|and it's a four door which is nice,|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but it's still a little cramped.|sv
B|I've got three kids,|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|so I, I,|%
A|Sounds like you, you need at least like a Taurus size, or something like that.|bf
B|Yeah,|aa

B|Uh,|%
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I know a lot of guys at work,|sd
A|they, uh, the ones that have, uh, families, uh,|sd

A|That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus?|sd
B|Oh, really?|bh
B|Yeah|ny
A|In fact, it comes with a standard stick|sd
A|and, uh, and a lot of those.|sd
B|Ooh.|ba
A|And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that.|sd
A|But, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
A|and usually they're in like black, and gun metal grey and those kind of colors.|sd
A|You're not going to see too many, uh, you know, green ones or blue ones or anything like that.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|They, they put them in sporty colors I guess.|sv
A|But, uh,|%
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, my wife wants a Miyata.|sd

B|Right,|b
B|yeah.|b
B|I know,|aa
B|I know.|aa
B|It's like I, I guess I could fit in it maybe|sv
A|Yeah.|b
A|I, I went, I went through that when I first got out of, uh, college.|sd
A|I had an old car that I bought just to get to, to my my first job.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|And when I got there, the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|And I, I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater, uh, sports car.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But that, that just does not make it as an only car.|sv
A|It's, uh, it's like I, I would,|sd
A|I bought a set of stereo speakers|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and it was one of those cash and carry deals.|sd
A|I had to take them one at a time, with the top down.|sd
A|And it was winter, so I was in like this coat with the top down,|sd
B|Oh, no!|ba
A|and the speaker in the passenger seat.|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|And I drove that one home,|sd
A|and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the, passenger seat and drove that one home.|sd
A|And, uh, funny, funniest sight.|sv
A|And you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well, I,|%
B|you know, it's funny.|sv
B|Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college, or, you know, or when they were single anyway.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah.|b
B|They'd, they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last.|sd
B|I never did that.|sd
B|Uh, you know, my first car was a Toyota Corolla.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|And, uh, because I got a good deal on it|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and, uh, that was a great little car.|sd
B|Actually I met,|sd
B|that's how I met girls was, I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission, which I, I had never,|sd
B|I, I'd learned on an automatic transmission. And so, so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Boy, that's a good deal.|sv
B|And, uh, in fact I married one of those people|sd
A|Ah, okay.|b
A|Well, I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again|sd
B|And it worked.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|it worked all right, real good.|sd
A|Huh.|b
A|Because I, I know we've, uh,|%
A|that's, that's something that, that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission.|sd
A|My, uh, my wife just can't, can't, uh,|sd
A|she really doesn't want to learn I guess, the, uh, the standard shift.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|yeah.|b
A|I fact, I, I remember once we, uh, we, uh, went, uh, went on a, uh, test drive.|sd
A|We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said, you know, I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Yeah.|b
A|And we went, uh, we went, uh, we went to a dealership|sd
A|and, uh, it, it was she, she did pretty well.|sd
A|But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|and the, uh, dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking,|sd
A|because that was all it was.|sd
A|It was, it was the funniest thing,|sd
A|it was like, uh, a big Le Baron,|sd
A|it was a Le Baron with everything on it,|sd
B|Wow!|ba
A|but it had a standard shift.|sd
A|It was the craziest thing I ever saw.|sv
B|That's weird!|ba
B|Yeah.|b
A|And, and, and that's probably why they were trying to sell them, I guess.|sv
B|Huh.|b
A|And, uh, we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth.|sd
A|She did pretty well after a while.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, uh, it's just kind of hard to learn, I guess.|sv
B|Well, my wife,|%
B|I mean, she'd always driven standard transmission.|sd

A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And you can change the channels on the, on the radio from the back seat too|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And put speaker phones in it.|sd
B|So.|%
A|Now, now, now that used to be a luxury,|sv

B|Right.|aa
A|You've got to have that now.|sv
B|That's right.|aa
B|That's right.|aa
A|You're used to it|sv
A|and you got to have it.|sv
B|And you've got to pay for it too.|sd
A|Yeah.|aa
A|That's true too.|aa
