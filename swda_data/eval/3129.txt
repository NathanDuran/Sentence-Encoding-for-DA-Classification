A|Well, Tom, just tonight, I was working on my car out of necessity,|sd
A|and I had, uh, uh, had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working,|sd
A|uh, this is the type of, uh, switch where you flip the, the lever, the turn signal on the column|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and when I would, uh, put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely,|sd
A|which is even worse than them just not getting bright|sv
B|Exactly.|aa
A|And I had presumed that it was the switch,|sd
A|and, uh, this is, uh, an older car,|sd
A|it's a seventy-two M G,|sd
A|so I had to mail order the part, uh,|sd
A|which I had done,|sd
A|and tonight I went out and, uh, at least hooked in the new part, only to discover that that apparently is not the problem,|sd
A|it's not in the switch, because it does the same thing with the new switch.|sd
B|Oh.|b
A|So I'll be faced with having to return that product and, uh, hoping that, uh, you know, that they will accept it,|sd
A|although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used.|sd
B|Did you do the diagnosis, or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed?|qy
A|Uh, I had done what diagnosis I could, primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and, uh, pretty much decided that that had to be the problem.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I talked to one mechanic about it,|sd
A|and he suspected the switch also.|sd
A|Uh, but I've not, you know,|%
A|I really don't know what the problem might be.|sd
A|It, it, the other switch could be the main switch itself, uh, that turns the lights on or off, which is on the dashboard|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, it might be tied into the equation somehow,|sv
A|but,|%
B|Yeah, I know,|b
B|uh, when working with the, uh, flashers, there is, uh, usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.|sv
B|Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam?|qy
A|I I don't know,|no
A|I should look at that.|sv
A|I don't remember seeing one in the, uh, in the diagram|sd
B|Diagram.|^2
A|so I'll have to go back and look at that.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse.|sd
B|I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit, like the headlamp|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|you tend to think, well, there's one fuse operating the whole thing,|sd
B|but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires, uh, the use of a, of a maybe a higher fuse.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|that's a good idea.|sv
B|So, that's a possibility.|sv
A|What I've typically found when that, uh,|sd
A|companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all,|sv
A|and I hope that that's the case this time.|sd
B|Is this a, a mail order parts house that specializes in, in parts for parts for, uh, old imports?|qy
A|Right,|na
A|exactly|na
B|Who,|%
A|it's out of Kansas somewhere.|sd
B|Um|b
B|so, it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that.|qy^d
A|No,|nn
A|it's not.|sd
A|I also got a piece of chrome for the, the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car,|sd
A|but it is not either,|sd
A|it's obviously doesn't quite fit,|sd
A|so it must be for a different year,|sd
A|so I'll have to try to return that as well.|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|have you found any, uh, uh, reliable import service people in the metroplex?|qy
A|Well, I had one person that I used for years and years on this car,|na
A|because I've owned this car since it was new,|sd
A|and, uh,|%
A|but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area|sd
B|Oh, yeah.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and I hadn't used him for some years,|sd
A|and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized|sd
A|instead of, uh, all import cars, he has narrowed it down to where he only works on, uh, German cars and ause German cars|sd
B|I'll be darned.|ba
A|I'm not sure that he works on much else at all,|sd
A|but he doesn't work on British cars any more, and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it.|sd
A|So, uh, uh, I may have to check with that person,|sd
A|as it turns out that one, that shop is near where I now work.|sd
A|So, I'll, uh, I should be able to take it in and check that part out.|sd
A|I've not had to exchange any other parts recently, because they were defective.|sd
A|Now, I've had, had pretty good luck,|sd
A|I just, however, did, uh, have to get a, a, uh, one of these jam box portable dual cassette players, uh, repaired.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I purchased it at Sam's,|sd
A|and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty,|sd
A|and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt,|sv
A|because I didn't take it in right away, and let a whole year go by.|sd
A|Uh, some of the buttons didn't work right, where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play,|sd
A|and as it turned out, it had a full year's warranty,|sd
A|and I could have gotten it repaired for free|sd
A|but I had to take it in,|sd
B|Oh, my goodness.|ba
A|while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost,|sd
A|uh, but it didn't do me any good, because I had, I had missed the window by about a week or two.|sd
B|Oh, no.|ba
A|So I didn't even, I didn't really, uh, even bring it up when I went in to pick it up.|sd
A|But, uh, that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect.|sd
B|Well, ours wasn't within the last year.|sd
B|I guess it's been within the last two years, uh,|sd
B|Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new,|sd
B|and it's one with the, uh, electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer, and, uh,|sd
B|I don't know what else it all controls, but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort,|sd
B|and we found that the, uh, uh, we were having two problems.|sd
B|It was idling fast, when you first started the engine, to the point that we park on a hill, under our car port,|sd
B|and, it, when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley,|sd
B|and knowing that, you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard,|sd
B|otherwise it would just wrench control away from you.|sd
A|Good grief.|ba
B|And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would, uh, be driving along, uh, decelerating, like coming to a stop sign, but not yet stopped at the stop sign|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and the engine would just quit.|sd
B|So, we took it back to the, uh, Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out,|sd
B|and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing,|sd
B|so they adjusted timing|sd
B|and the problem didn't go away,|sd
B|so we ended up taking it back again,|sd
B|and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around,|sd
B|but the second time around they looked at their, uh, recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever,|sd
B|and, and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the, uh, computer control unit,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|which fortunately they replaced under warranty, because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part|sd
A|My goodness.|ba
B|and, uh, so once they replaced it, then the, the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time,|sd
A|Huh.|b
B|and now it seems to be,|sd
B|we we're not experiencing the stalling,|sd
B|but we're still experiencing a very uneven,|sd
