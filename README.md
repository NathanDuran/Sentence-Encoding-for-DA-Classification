# TODO

- models
- Add second dense layer to classification layers??? Time distributed?
- could half units in lstm and train for longer?

- GRU?
- Recurrent convolutional
- rnnlm
- document context language model
- elmo
- bert

- Visualising attention layers
- Save train/test history + predictions?
