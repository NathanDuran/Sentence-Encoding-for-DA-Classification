# Supervised and Semi-supervised Sentence Encoding Methods for Dialogue Act Classification

# TODO
- retest bi_lstm and deep_bi_lstm
- test rcnn and crf models
- test gru models
- bert Different num layers

## models
- CRF, More models and/or add use_crf to model_params (i.e. in model just swap classification layers)
- Make bi-directional a parameter?
- https://github.com/AlexYangLi/TextClassification

- rnnlm + char + seq2seq language models?
- mLSTM https://github.com/titu1994/Keras-Multiplicative-LSTM

## Misc
- Document the models in readme

## To try
- Visualising attention layers
- Saving trained embeddings
